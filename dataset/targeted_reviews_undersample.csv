0,"I bought my computer in Feb 2021. Now it is April 2022 and it shuts itself off without warning, with a defective pink screen. I'd be surprised if it lasts throughout the month. I'm not sure if this is due to planned obsolescence, or some other reason. Either way, I am not impressed. One year is not a good shelf life for a computer. My previous MacBook lasted only 2 years before it shut itself down for good. My older MacBook Pro from 2012 still works, so I know that it is not me that is the problem."
1,I spent more than six hours on the phone with Apple support trying to get this to work. Total fail and waste of time. I never thought I’d buy an apple product that was defective.
2,"This is my very first MacBook finally, got it out of necessity for work backup computer and will work great w/easy setup and ability to connect to home wifii. Brand new 2020, no touch screen but impeccable quality for a smaller laptop and unbeatable price!"
3,"I have two MacBook Airs (MBA), a 13"" and a 11, both with the previous form factor (the wide, body colored bezel around the screen, 1280x800 resolution) and this new 13"" MBA improves upon it in every way (almost) and makes it nearly perfect."
4,"The one we received worked just fine. However, it’s uneven so when I try to sit it on a flat surface to type, it rocks. Rather annoying and something I never thought of before."
5,I’ve only been using my MacBook Air for a few weeks now but it’s already the best purchase I’ve made in a long time. I was debating getting either a windows or an apple computer and decided in the end to get this MacBook Air. The screen itself is amazing and I love how smooth the keyboard types. And as someone who has a phone and an iPad it’s so convenient having all my devices synced up. Highly recommend!
6,I’ve been wanting to switch from my pc. Everything else I own is Apple. When the prime day price popped up I couldn’t resist. It is definitely a learning curve but fairly easy to get used to. As far as I can see I don’t need to add any programs. I was able to migrate everything from my PC and this baby is FAST!
7,"First new computer since 2011. Replaced an old iMac with this. Blazing fast, bright graphics, responds well, well built. And a fantastic value. With 256G of storage, it cost the same as the new Apple Watch Ultra."
8,I am so impressed  cause when I just sow the price I said noway but its fantastic really am happy and this is coming from a android person don't think a lot just get it
9,"This is my first macbook and thank you for changing the shipping restrictions, I was able to buy one. I am still adjusting with the keyboard and the OS coming from a long time windows user. The battery life is amazing. Better than my windows laptop. Hopefully I can buy the higher specs next time, I don't mind paying the tax. I originally wanted to get the 16gb ram and 1tb storage, but it doesn't ship to my location. And thanks for the fast shipping."
10,"Yes, there are ""thousands "" of apps available as advertised. They do not include popular apps such as Amazon, Facebook, Spectrum  Instagram or Sprint. Work related apps like Indeed and LinkedIn. Other apps for stores we like to shop at.  You can access these website on the browser. FYI, that's how I accessed websites on my very first laptop...in 1997.  Works great for reading email and Facetime."
11,Had to take computer to Apple care center because after spending 3 hours in the phone with Apple support they couldn’t help me anymore. Thankfully  computer was under warranty so I didn’t pay  and they were able to fix it but the closest apple care was 2 hours from my home. Computer works great now though!
12,"To hard to set up and use. Not real computer literate, old man. Always used android computers. First MacBook and at this point would not buy again.  Have iPhone, iPad, and I something for music. Those are easy to use. Not the MacBook. Bought brand new, won’t buy a MacBook next time. Haven’t used it once since I got it. Heard they were so much better than androids. Don’t think so."
13,"I bought this MBA for my wife for Valentine's Day, and she has been in love with it ever since. She thinks it was the best Vday gift that she has gotten in years, it does everything so well!"
14,"I bought this 2020 MacBook Air (8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD storage) to replace a 2014 MacBook Air (4GB RAM, 256 GB SSD storage).  I am undeniably a fan of Apple products in general, because they work with little fuss and are built to last (note that my old MacBook Air is more than 7 years old and still working perfectly).  Although I've been underwhelmed by some Mac models in recent years, this one is stellar IMHO.  Unless you have very heavy system requirements this machine would be an excellent choice."
15,"As many others have shared, the Apple MacBook Air M1 is a great laptop. The display is gorgeous. The keyboard is accurate and smooth. Apple has the best trackpads! Battery life is so good that there is no anxiety over having enough power to finish the day."
16,Nothing wrong with the MacBook itself. It was just not practical for me what I needed for my work. So I started a return. First you send them the product I guess in good faith. Then once they receive the item then with in 7 days they will refund your purchase. Mind you I returned this in the complete original package only 4 days after receiving it. It’s going on 2 months and nothing but Crickets from everyone. Buyer Beware!!
17,"La compré para actualizar mi iMac de casi 10 años que ya anda algo lenta. La nueva iMac no me agrada su diseño, así que también por presupuesto adquirí esta MacBook Air M1 a muy buen precio, es muy ligera lo cual hace que pueda transportarla fácilmente. Es realmente rápida comparada con mi antigua Mac y con la compu del trabajo."
18,Not sure where these laptops were stored but the musty smell was overpowering when I opened up the box.  The main culprit was the power cord.  I went online to find a solution and found multiple complaints about this model’s cord.  LOVE the computer….hate the cord smell.  Luckily it stays charged so long that I can put it in another room to charge every 3rd day.
19,"Even in 2022, this laptop is a solid choice. As can be expected from Apple, the build quality feels premium. It is lightweight yet sturdy and the hinge feels great as well. I can open the screen to any angle I want without worrying about it feeling flimsy. Coming from an older, heavier laptop with loud fans, I appreciate the fanless design of this MacBook immensely as I never have to feel like I am disturbing anyone with loud fans."
20,"The battery only lasts a few hours before it is dead, despite being used for menial tasks that do not typically drain a battery much. Not at all what I was expecting based on their marketing."
21,"I read the comments and it seemed legit but when I received my package, I didn’t get a MacBook. I got a broken HP with no charger!!! Now I have to wait forever for my refund"
22,"This MacBook is excellent. I’ve had it for a year now and it’s impressing me more than I thought it ever would. Every day, straight for 1 year and it’s working like a beast, the only thing is to not eat over it as the keyboard gets pretty mucky and you have to get it deep cleaned. In conclusion, this computer is more than a beast than my old 2015 Macbook Pro"
23,"i've had my m1 macbook air (16 gb ram, 512 gb storage) for about a year, and it's the best computer i've ever owned. for the majority of users, the base model will be enough, but if you want to upgrade ram, it's not a bad choice. works amazing for everything i do, screen quality is great, audio is pretty good, performance is amazing. all around great laptop for 95% of people."
24,"i cant image how come apple will put such a low resolution camera on a 1000 laptop. i bought it mainly for zoom meeting but it's not to my expectation, so i returned it"
25,"The 2020 MacBook Air BigSur OS is one of the newest computers on the market at the moment and one of Apple’s best designs. Apple has had many MacBook models throughout their many years of being the best electronic company, but The BigSur OS has many features that other models and other company computers do not have. This MacBook comes with high quality upload speed, all-day battery life, and superfast memory, which makes it the best choice for any computer or laptop right now."
26,"Through the past year and a half, students have had to use personal computers and laptops for everyday tasks, most importantly being school. From my personal experience I believe that the MacBook Air 2020 is the best tool for the job. If you plan to frequently use a personal computer or laptop in the future, the MacBook Air is the right choice because of its processing speed and storage, ability to keep a charge, and the apple compatibility that it uses."
27,"Yay, spent a G on a new grey screen of death.  A month after the return was received by amazing... still no refund.  Spend the extra $150 and get it from Apple.  Duh?"
28,I purchased a new version and I was sent a refurbished one.I found that it was refurbished when I tried adding apps to the laptop.A pop up came on the screen stating certain apps are not compatible with jail broken laptops.
29,my new 13in Macbook Air has a lot of fingerprints on the INSIDE of the glass screen. It's on the top left corner down the left side and starts along the bottom. I don't like it .
30,DO NOT BUY. This computer has had issues from day 1. I’ve had to go to the Mac store 3 times now and I’m going again on Monday. It’s always a new issue. USELESS!!!!!!!
31,"I had several problems so took the MacBook Air into Best Buy for help.  I was told I had received ""a lemon"" and should return it to Amazon.  I had it 3 weeks so was able to return it for a refund which I am waiting for right now.  I have loved my 2012 MacBook Air and am hoping the next one I order will be okay."
32,"I was able to snag one of these for $700 with the M2 MacBook Air arriving the day after I am writing this review. If it was in this price bracket all the time, it would be a no brainer best choice, and I am having a hard time finding worthy competition even at its $1,000 msrp range."
33,This piece of junk is unable to connect wirelessly to  my printer.  My 10 year old mac has no problems printing on my Epson printer.  I have tried everything suggested and it still claims my printer is OFFLINE.
34,The Mac is great as a school computer and i use it almost everyday. With that being said I dont have to charge it often and it has little to no problems. Overall a great product.
35,"I PURCHASED A NEW MacBook Air, AND I RECEIVED A USED ONE WITH SOFTWARE ALREADY IN INSTALLED BY SOMEONE IN THE UK. THE CURSER WOULD STICK AND THE COMPUTER WOULD SHUT DOWN, TERRIBLE FOR A PRICE OF OVER $900."
36,My first Apple product. So far finding it difficult to set up. No instructions. Not intuitive at all. All my android were much easier to use right out of the box. Still trying to figure out how to load a program. Grrr
37,This is a very good laptop and easy to use.  A few things I've noticed is the backlit keyboard is very nice and adjusts automatically.  The keyboard is easy to type on and get used to and the touchpad is great.  The battery is extremely good too.
38,"I don’t really like it, I can’t download iTunes whenever I want to download iTunes it’s just too difficult and every time this message (iTunes quit  unsuspectedly) appears every time I download it, I can’t download it and I really need it to fix my iPhone."
39,"When I was in college, I used both mac and PC and after I graduated I switched exclusively to PC because of the versatility (gaming and upgradability). When I decided to go back to grad school, I decided to give Apple another chance with this laptop because I heard great things and high expectation with the new m1 chip design. I was not disappointed."
40,Apple is not standing behind this product.  We bought this laptop in 12/2020.  We activated it but my husband changed his mind.  It sat in our office for 1 1/2 years  We just plugged it in for my granddaughter for college and it won't charge.  Apple wants $428 to fix with only 90 day warrantee.  It has no trade in value and was never hooked up to the internet.  So sad
41,"i believe i bought this in march, it’s currently may. when i got it the box wasn’t damaged or anything. but the caps lock button and space bar malfunction. sometimes i have to press them multiple times for them to work."
42,Purchased as a replacement upgrade for older MacBook. Very happy with screen and battery life. We also own MacBook PRO and one other Mac Air so we're picky! Highly recommended.
43,"This M1 is such a leap ahead for Apple. It has great battery life, no heat, and is fast and versatile. I  ordered the 512 model, but as a casual user, I don’t know if I will ever use all that memory. I think that many people could order the 256 base model, and save some bucks. An external drive is cheaper than built in memory. The fingerprint sensor is wonderful!"
44,"I encourage people who have had a bad taste left in their mouth by older (Intel) MacBooks, like myself, at least try out an M1 machine in person and see the difference."
45,"I have had this MacBook Air in the gold color for a few months now. This is actually my very first MacBook. I absolutely LOVE it. First of all, it is gorgeous. I am a sucker for cute packaging or a cute product, and this laptop is just stunning. I have never seen a beautiful laptop until I got this."
46,"The only computers I've ever owned have been Macs, starting with a Mac SE in 1987. This is the first time I've bought one that has mainly made me angry."
47,I'm a big techie and after seeing all the benchmarks had to get the M1. It's truly a game changing processor. My wife and I love this laptop. There's a slight adjustment as I'm a lifelong Windows user but MacOS is intuitive enough that it's not too bad. I tried to make the switch with Safari but it lacks profiles so I'm on the Brave browser. Brave works great and have had no issues so far. I also use signal and Bitwarden and both work fine.
48,"I love Linux, i can tolerate windows, usually don't like Mac. It's fine folks like what they like for me, Linux gives the most choice is extensible, and runs so fast on even older hardware, you get infinite support you don't get harassed to use cortana, siri, candy crush itunes etc etc.  Mac usually they push you so hard in this echo system for a lot of stuff i really don't like. it used to be just getting music out of itunes was a pain."
49,"I was hesitant to get a smaller Macbook after my 15"" 2015 Macbook Pro started to suffer from keyboard issues.  I repaired the keyboard twice, so there must have been something wrong with voltage regulation to it."
50,I love the screen quality even tho it’s not touch screen I love it and it’s so easy to use and perfect for all my classes it’s super light and portable
51,"I've owned this laptop for a year and a half, and felt compelled to take time out of my frantic day to note that I really think this computer is a giant step backward for the Macbook Air model and for Macintosh as a brand compared to my old 2013 Macbook Air running Yosemite."
52,"I bought my Macbook Pro in 2013 which makes it 8 years old. It's still going strong. I did have to replace the battery a few years back. I did it myself, bit of a pain as Apple locks their stuff down pretty well. It looks like Apple will drop support for this late 2012 model next year. That's when I'll get a new one. Not bad for close to 10 years for one machine. About a hundred bucks a year."
53,"I got this because my 2015 iMac was having trouble with video editing. Everyone said the M1 chip was so powerful that this thing would be able to handle most video editing with no problem, and at first that seemed right. It lags less when I'm actually editing. But today I exported a video with a very simple blur filter and this thing can't even play the exported video without freezing. Tried restarting and everything"
54,"I’ve been purchasing on Amazon and never get disappointed. This laptop is gorgeous and LOOKS BRAND NEW! I can’t afford brand new laptop due to other school expenses and so I was so excited to buy it. You’ll only end up returning this laptop at the end. Also, I came back to see if there’s new buyer but the price caught my attention. They higher up the price and with $900 you can afford to buy brand new MacBook Air M1."
55,I’ve had this for a few months and the SCREEN turning black with lines. Can’t fix it. Keeps glitching and it’s bad performance for the price absolutely not worth it. It’s all just aesthetically pleasing that’s it nothing more. Save yourself some money.
56,"This is a Mac.  I like the products, but this little Mac could not do what I needed.  I returned the product, it has been received at the warehouse but my money is still not returned.  I the computer for 2 days and then Insent back.  Please refund my money."
57,This product does not allow you to hook up two external monitors with the M1 chip. Otherwise I’m sure the function is fine. Just disappointing the newest computer does less than the older models.
58,Back in 2020 I put the laptop on once. Tried to set it up and then shut it off since I couldn’t do it. Tried to turn it back it on in 2022 and it would not charge. Bought a battery from Apple and it still won’t turn in ! Such a waste of money for something I can’t even use.
59,"Picked up this model on sale for $799. If you can get it on sale, I'd recommend it even over the new M2 MacBook Air (if you're getting the base model) for those who want a capable machine that can handle day to day tasks and don't need all the bells and whistles of a Pro model."
60,Apple has gone through 3 Big Sur OS updates and there's still quirks to deal with. I end up re-starting sometimes just to get software booted up and documents retrieved from iCloud.
61,"The macbook air M1 arrived totally dead with no charging cable or power brick.  The laptop was extremely beat up, scratched everywhere and completely grimy and dirty.  It looks like it was never cleaned.  The hinge also has wear and the lid does not want to stay up.  an utter and complete piece of crap."
62,No problems with the unit in the first month.  First update was a little buggy but seems to be working alright.  I'd say this computer is about what I expected.
63,Waiting for credit from Amazon on return via UPS. We were unable to have this laptop work with Zoom no audio or video and it was unstable with the Google Chrome browser. My son is a software engineer for a San Francisco Social media company and he thinks that this new processing chip being used by Apple is problematic.
64,Their support staff created more problems than I could ever have and i have wasted at least 20 hours on hold and trying to get Apple to set up my new MAC and I still cannot use this computer.  I am seriously thinking to send back and hoping I can!
65,I loved my computer and the affirm payment plan. My husband had me purchase as my Christmas gift. I have had it less then 3 months but over the Amazon exchange time and it's a paper weight because the keyboard no longer works. Cautious is all I can say when buying electronics of expense from Amazon.
66,"Very disappointing. Those 2 USB c ports as the only ports, is the most disappointing thing ever. Also, it runs out of memory quite often. I only stick with it because of a software I need. Otherwise, I stick to my windows laptop and stay sane"
67,honestly this laptop is garbage!!!! I HAD a macbookpro from 2013 that was almost neck on photoshop and illustrator being almost 10 years old ! like cumoon ! … oh and u have to buy a dam dongle because it only comes with 2 usbc connections and u know dam welll one is for charging ! … also if u dont have another mac dont eveer open disk utility because u need a secoond one if u erase ur hardrive
68,I never write reviews but I’m taking time to write this one.tried to save some money on a open box Mac never again with Amazon they have horrible quality control could not even get through setup without it freezing up and then it does not recognize my Apple ID returning and going to bestbuy would of reordered with Amazon but have to wait till return is received and then then they will mail one out that’s going to take maybe two weeks total time I don’t think so never again
69,3 hours with apple support  - with no relief in sight - no way to turn off favorites side which pops up when ever it wants - need an additional lap top will not purchase this again
70,"I bought this just to try Apple and I absolutely hate it the layout, no touch screen, keys are hard to type on bc super small and the worst is trying to return it. Return option is only 1 and its been such a hassle to even return it and you get charged"
71,I love my IPad so I thought this would be great but it is not. No touch screen. I am having trouble even using it. Total waste of my money.
72,"So far, I've had to have this repaired twice. First time, it needed a new board and screen. Second time, a new Thunderbolt port. Amazon won't accept a return or exchange because it's past the return date."
73,No instructions what to do when something is not working. I can not connect to the blue tooth and the apple stores are closed in my town. I don’t know how to fix it
74,"The unit is smaller than the original Air, also it has NO USB ports, the description on the page is misleading and they never show the right-hand side of the unit in the pictures, otherwise, I would have never bought it, Amazon return policy is horrible they take 2 weeks to refund your money, took it out looked at it said nope, didn't even registered it.  Waste of time and money."
75,After 2 months their is a error that I can’t turn my videos at all. I watch YouTube to fix it but didn’t work. I am pretty upset and not happy.
76,"I purchased for my son to use for school, it stopped working after two weeks, I spent the past two weeks working with Apple who can't get it to function.  I contacted Amazon to replace, they have refused to replace and continue to re-direct me to Apple.  Don't buy an Apple computer from Amazon, they will not replace it even if defective."
77,"Don’t appreciate how I received a used macbook with fingerprints on the screen. They tried to put the film back on the screen as it was originally, but it wasn’t stuck to the screen as it should have been. I returned it because i refuse to spend that much money on something someone else had their hands one. It’s unacceptable especially due to covid. I went and bought one locally and it was brand new no fingerprints and the film was stuck to the screen as it should be because thats how Apple packages it."
78,"Bought 2 ipads, could not connect to internet, wasted money.  Bought an expensive phone, needed assembly, never worked, wasted money.  Bought a new MacBook, in setup after argument to use English, when I entered the Wi-Fi password 3 times, it never accepted it, it went nuts and sailed off into disability screens I could not fathom.  The touchpad seems not to work.  Does not have a USB port, without using an external mouse is less than junk to me.  Now we start pulling teeth, scheduled a return, will I get credit?"
79,"Battery life was wonderful. However, multiple issues with interacting with Zoom; which was a central reason for purchasing the MacBook. I have an Apple phone and thought a MacBook would be a great addition. Unfortunately, that was not  the case for me. If you aren’t familiar with MacBooks, it takes some adjusting to go from a laptop to a MacBook. I ended up returning the MacBook and purchased a laptop instead."
80,"Can't add much that hasn't already been said. I upgraded from a 2017 MacBook Air and find this to be superior in just about every way. The battery life is at least twice what the 2017 was, the screen is much better, the keyboard is better, the overall size of the computer is smaller and I love the larger haptic feedback touchpad. I don't use the camera but it isn't the greatest from what I understand and I do kind of miss the magsafe connector."
81,"I'm a mac guy and have been purchasing mac products for years.  I was taken back by the camera quality on this product.  It was strange that the 2015 macbook air that I sold before getting this 2020 version had a much better camera.  The camera quality is horrible.  It almost looks like a camera from 2001.  Other than that the product is great, and does what it needs to do."
82,"I upgraded from MBP2018 15"" to MBA 2020 , simply too good value, much lighter in weight, but the running speed is actually my old computer is still very smooth too, the screen improvement is obvious"
83,I had a MacBook Pro 13 2015...that machine lasted a long time and I love it. It dropped and I needed a replacement fast. MacBook Air 2020 is not a disappointment. The battery life even if downloading is incredible. I had it downloading all night and I still have a charge. It was only a slow download because the internet speed sucks. The touch ID is a delight. I love the picture quality. So far I am so impressed. Hopefully it will last as much as the other lasted.
84,"This is a M1 Macbook Air what more can we say?  We went with Used - Good Condition Space Gray in order to save money and so far everything looks and works well.  There were 2 battery cycles, minor signs of use on the bottom, and the charger was obviously used but otherwise its in good shape.  There were about 8 months of factory warranty left and I couldn't add applecare+ since it was bought used so I went with a 3rd party warranbty service instead."
85,"I am not a computer nerd, I use my computer to finish charts from work when I am at home or to just browse the web so the MacBook Air was all I needed. I love the screen, the keyboard, size, and weight."
86,"Recibi el articulo con la misma calidad que el de una tienda. Sin problemas hasta el momento. Inicialmente pensé que el equipo tendría 8 GPU sin embargo he recibido la versión de 7 GPU aunque para mí esta bien hubiese querido 8, creo que parte de la descripción del producto eran 8 GPU."
87,"The only thing I can’t figure out , and I haven’t put much effort into it since I’m in the hospital is how to turn on the touch screen option. I thought it would be automatically on . Other than that I love my new MacBook Air Laptop and would recommend it to anyone looking for a laptop computer"
88,"I bought this to replace a 2015 MacBook Pro, and it’s worked out great. Better screen and better battery life. Much faster processor. Also much thinner and lighter yet I can use my existing laptop sleeve. Happy with this."
89,I love this laptop it’s very light it’s very thin the screen is a great size not too big not too small the battery life is great Mine did not come with the touchscreen but I really don’t have a need for it the keyboard is perfectly fine I highly recommend this laptop I can’t say anything bad about it would buy it again
90,"This is my very first MacBook! I’ve been wanting to have one but couldn’t afford it. I was using my Sony laptop since 2004 and it finally broke. I thought, if I was gonna buy a new laptop it should be MacBook so I did save some money for it, but my savings could only afford MacBook Air 2020. I love it! It’s looks cool and I enjoy using it and will probably use until it lasts lol."
91,"I'm giving this a 5 star because the laptop is perfect for what it is and the seller was great, however I watched multiple YouTube videos glorifying the M1 chip as being fast enough that 8GB could handle a ton of open applications. I need a bunch of tabs open for my work, use Canva constantly, and occasionally need to open Photoshop too so I needed to return this and buy 16GB. But that's my fault and the YouTube reviews faults, not the laptop. Battery life is amaaaazing though!"
92,"Yo compré esta computadora porque mi antigua laptop tenía seis años y me estaba causando muchas dificultades en mi trabajo y con mis clases. Entran en zoom era un problema y con está computadora no me ha pasado. Es la primera vez que tengo una Mac y aunque al principio me costó un poco acostumbrarme al sistema de apple, pero la rapidez y duración de la bateria valen la pena. Es muy fácil trabajar con esta computadora, mientras que con la otra podía esperar hasta una hora para que terminara de cargar un programa. La recomiendo."
93,"I was looking for a laptop that was easy to use, light and portable since I live in a apartment with wife and 2 kids there is no space to have a full blown desk so I needed something small and fast and this new MacBook Air is perfect, I love everything about it,  battery life is great but then again I mostly use it for light web browsing and email checking nothing heavy"
94,"Best laptop you can buy but mine came scratched idk why Apple is trying to punish me for but it's fine. Also be really careful because the screen is special, it has a coating for retina display and even touching it or gently cleaning it can remove some of the coating and leave subtle blue marks. Sound is boxy I'd recommend SpeakerAmp and choose flat sound to get a clearer sound. But nothing is perfect of course and for that price this is a great investment"
95,For the price and it apple product. I expected much more. Not able to download certain apps due to the small storage space on the laptop. Have to purchase an extra adapter for additional  USB ports.
96,"In general I love this MacBook Air. I have had other Apple products but this is my first laptop.  It has a great display, it opens easily with touch (fingerprint) ID, you can move easily from here to there and not lose any information. It is great for most purposes. The things I have had trouble with are the Apple word processing, spreadsheet or presentation programs, so I continue to use Office 365. That is not totally fair in this review as the device is wonderful!"
97,"My husband bought me one for Christmas 2020 and my son loved it so we bought him one for Christmas 2021. Great laptop, great price for MacBook. Only thing is I wish it was a touch screen. Love it!!!"
98,it works really well! the screen quality is very good and clear. I’ve been doing schoolwork on mine and it allows me to do things my other computer will not. overall a very beautiful laptop and great purchase! would recommend!!
99,I bought what I considered to be a “Rose Gold” MacBook and it’s absolutely beautiful. It works just as well. I’m just Mac’ing away with course studies as well as my business. Now I can work at home or take it with me wherever I go. It’s light weight and the resolution is amazing. So much better than the laptop I was using.
100,First Mac laptop I’ve owned and I’m very impressed! Display colors are incredible. Processing speed with the M1 chip is amazing. Super long battery life and light weight. So much packed in a thin design!
101,I love this ease of transferring my data from my old Mac. It is a bit smaller though the screen is the same size so that’s nice. I’m not tech savvy so can’t say much about that aspect. My disappointment is that it doesn’t have a USB port like the old one for charging other devices on the side.
102,"Pros. I Love the new M1 processor, I had an i5 MacBook air before this one that was fast, this one is to me compares to the i9 for speed."
103,It was a very nice laptop! Loved the color. The specs was great. I am not very comfortable or familiar with Apple products. Returned for a refund and bought a Windows laptop. Really wanted to keep it but had a hard time figuring out how to use it.
104,"No issues with this MacBook, came in perfect condition, very easy to navigate, LOVE the Touch ID, and the camera quality is okay, not as good as a phone. The battery lasts about an entire day, and the charger that comes with it is super high quality. Buttons are very big and easy to see and push, the lighting on them is perfect. The touch pad being bigger is wonderful! Very light and easy to handle, get as much storage as you can afford. Able to do everything I need & more, 100% recommend."
105,"Battery life is great, once you are not doing to much things. I had a glitch with the mouse the first day I bought it. But I have not seen it again from that day. It is portable, nice slim laptop, not heavy, work well so far. Camera quality is not so good, I think apple could have updated their camera quality, but it is fine anyways, usable. The speakers are loud and nice. Nice sound quality."
106,"After a month of usage, the keyboard does not respond accurately, it repeats different keys and numbers. The delete key sometimes work sometimes it does not. I tried refreshing and it did not work. I had to send it get checked to see what the problem is. I think is hardware. Bad luck! If you can, pay international warranty coverage."
107,Not long ago I decided to get far from Apple products because some work necessities I couldn't cover with an iPhone and a Mac. The limitation of the Iphone for some advanced features (like dual SIM and the possibility to flash OS images from a ssd) and the need to use bootcamp in the Mac made me jump to an android phone and a windows computer.
108,"Nowhere was it mentioned that this is the castrated 7 GPU Core version. Feeling deceived. In addition, the 8 GB RAM / 256GB SSD Version is nigh useless for anything beyond websurfing. Having multiple apps open concurrently almost immediately yields the spinning beach ball of death. With a regular set of apps, like the MS Office suite, the disk fills up in no time. Now OS updates are not working, since they require at least 15 GB disk space. But - battery life is out of this world, with the CPU temp sitting at 36C!"
109,"I purchased this for my wife figuring that professionals are fine working with 13-inch MacBook Pros and she only needed the Air, base package, which we received in such a tiny box that we didn't dare open it up because it was so incredibly tiny that whatever was inside had to be minuscule and our older, more experienced, tired eyes could not have dealt with such a toy. I sent it back unopened today. Still not sure there was a MacBook Air in there, it was so miniature in size."
110,"Este Portatil tiene muchas cosas buenas, entre ellas destaco la camara es mejor q la de mi anterior Asus y la rapidez que tiene para ejecutar las aplicaciones, apesar de solo tener 8GB es suficiente y la nitidez de las pantallas de Mac siempre son superiores- Dura bastante la bateria, (tampoco las 18 horas que dicen ellos, pero si mas de 8 horas)"
111,"No complaints so far - in fact, I am actually very impressed! The battery life is incredible (although I have only had it for two days!) and the screen, keyboard, and body are great. I had a Macbook Pro (2012) eons ago and this is obviously far and above that."
112,"Other then battery life this thing is awesome. No complaints, lightning fast, never had a single problem with anything as of yet. Would like the battery to last more then a few hours but it could also be everything I have running on the computer. Overall I would recommend this to my friends and family"
113,Llegó en algo menos de dos días. Está Macbook air M1 es lo mejor de lo mejor. La capacidad de memoria es asombrosa. La rapidez parece indicar que Apple se ha adelantado muchos años.
114,"I absolutely love love my new lap top! I had a Macbook Air in college and now I have one for working at home and for traveling if the desire arises! The price is great and the quality is excellent, I noticed other reviews commenting on the quality of the video, however I do not see it being grainy at all!"
115,I never owned a Mac before and I am very pleased with this purchase. I was nervous about ordering it off Amazon at first but it was slightly cheaper and came in exactly two days. No issues with damages or overall quality. Screen quality/graphics are great. I am able to play most of the computer games I wanted to on here with no overheating issues. Battery lasts a while depending on what I am doing and charges very quickly.
116,"It’s not my first MacBook, and the quality of it is up to standards.  My issue is that I bought it in June of 2022, and it says it was produced in 2020.  The title is misleading, it makes you think that it’s 2020 model.  I hoped it wasn’t sitting on the shelf for two years, but looks like it was."
117,"Upgraded from my 2014 MacbookAir b/c it was slowing down. This 2020 MacbookAir started out great, but within 3 weeks it's slowing down too! Display is more or less fine. Front camera quality seems to have deteriorated somewhat. But trying to open applications, download/upload files, etc . . . is getting slow now and it's annoying."
118,"My first time MacBook experience, there are many things to learn, my iPhone and iPad  experiences helps, that is the Apple system, its shares so many apps, functionalities, the  M1 chip is amazing, laptop never got warm and I use it for three or four days without charging."
119,"I have to reset this thing at least 5 times per week in the middle of meetings and such for no reason. I've done all the updates and it's brand new, it just doesn't work. I'm guessing this has to do with the fact that it has an Apple chip instead of an Intel one, and like most things Apple actually makes its glitchy and unreliable. Makes sense that it was on sale. If you have to buy an Apple try to get the ones that have the fewest Apple parts as possible."
120,"I'm a Windows guy.  I bought this because I am creating a few apps.  The apps aren't ready; so I really haven't used it yet, beyond exploring for a few hours.  It's neither fast, nor large, by today's standards, but it is solid, light, and robust with Apple's latest release.  It'll last for years."
121,"Also I have been a Microsoft user for many many years, I decided to take the leap for a new OS and computer to expand my technology IQ and support for a new OS."
122,"We own a MacBook Pro but needed a second laptop to keep the marriage from going off the tracks.  Bought the MacBook Air and are very pleased.  It's lighter than our pro, has similar performance, is a bit lighter and cheaper.  The only negative is that its two USBC ports are on one side, makes it trickier to keep it plugged in our seating situation.  Probably not an issue for most.  Oh, the battery life seems better than the Pro.  Definitely recommend it."
123,so my thoughts are on the M1 air version and I must say its a great machine for the price it's my first apple device as I'm a pc gamer but I had to have this because of the ARM chipset being that it surpasses a lot of x86 chipsets it's very impressive the battery life is by far the most impressive thing about it...nothing at the moment beats the battery life it's great it has a great IPS display as well looks very vivid and sharp
124,"This was my first MAC purchase! the QUALITY, ENGINEERING, CRAFTMANSHIP is TOP notch! Surprisingly NOT HARD to adapt to using coming from a PC! VERY happy.. absolutely LOVE all the VERY helpful features, still discovering NEW ones & FASTER ways to do things on it EVERYDAY. Plus it LOOKS like a million bucks & very nice/addictive feel to the the touch.. can't say ENOUGH GOOD things about MacBook Air.. APPLE - - you've hit a GRAND SLAM with this one & the M1 chip!! thanks."
125,"Ive had this computer for 2 months now, and I still can’t find a single thing to complain about. The battery will last me 12 hours of gaming, something I didn’t think was even possible out of a high-performance laptop. When I say high performance, I mean it. This thing runs Minecraft on 60 fps with fancy graphics and 24 chunks of render distance; and it doesn’t even get hot! This is probably one of the best tech purchases I’ve ever made."
126,"What a great improvement over my old MacBook Pro. This is my third such computer. It keeps me in touch with the world and Amazon. What bugs me is the razzle dazzle passwords I must come up with to access other sites which is why I use Amazon almost exclusively There are so many goodies on this one that I will probably use only a few, though it is made for the new generation of users. Great product. Thanks Applel"
127,"This arrived exactly as i expected. I live in Jamaica and this product was shipped straight to me. It arrived perfectly packaged without even the slightest scratch or blemish. Just know that if you were to purchase this product you are getting exactly what you expected. It works. No hiccups or hangups. It's just fast, smooth and a premium looking laptop. I cant say enough good things about this device. Just take care of it and trust that you will have a working computer for the next decade or more.  Get it!!"
128,"I am not computer savvy, but find this Mac to be easy to use.  I was limping along on a 12 year old MacBook Pro and could not even update to the new OS (Big Sur), so it was time.  I didn't need the big footprint of a MacBook Pro so this is a good fit.  I'm still finding my way around but so far, so good."
129,"When has an apple product ever done anyone wrong. They are known for their reputation, and this is no exception. Obviously reliable, great battery life, stunning pixelation, and works well for remote working."
130,Get this computer for all intents and purposes! I bought it for IT and database administration and I just wanted a computer who could think for me. This is it. Along with its long computer time and screen life
131,I love it. This is my first IOS computer and I’m in love. The quality put into it is top notch. This is my primary computer for school and everyday use. It’s well worth the investment!!
132,I have been a Mac user for a long time and this one is certainly up to standards. Got some great help from Mac setting it up and ended the frustrations of my old one.
133,This works fine but I had to buy separate adapter to read thumb drives. Also bought  external hard drive and DVD player. All the extras run up the overall price.
134,"found it complicated and deprecated quickly.  The purchase price for me was 1000 saw it at 90 less 2 months later now it's almost $200 less.  Don't feel too good about this,"
135,Amazon had the best price at the time. Great machine. The keyboard is sublime. There are plenty of online reviews on websites and YouTube. This machine truly hits the sweet spot.
136,I had previously purchased a “renewed” MacBook Air and it wasn’t exactly what I would call renewed. I returned it and found a new MacBook Air for under $900. Only a few hundred more than someone else’s old one and I couldn’t be happier. I’ve had iPhones since 3GS and they have always been user friendly and the MacBook Air is just like my iPhone but better.
137,all forms of establishing this computer to the correct running system et/al went smoothly except all the  passwords were defined in a not described format and the email program could not be connected as iCloud had my email buried within the demographics it contained. it took two hours with apple to be able to send emails as the computer did not allow my google email to connect . However it is a very beautiful computer...wow...what a ride and an amazing thing to experience the apple representative and how he went thru each and every system...very interesting.
138,"I needed a new computer desperately, (screen broke and volume malfunctioned on my beloved old Asus transformer), so after much research about Macs online, I ordered a new MacBook Air. Most of the online reviews and info praised it except for the camera, and in this current pandemic Zoom world, that was a must!  However, I couldn't imagine a new apple  computer having a worse camera than my old iPhone 6 which I am still happily using, so I took a chance! The laptop is awesome on so many levels! New M1 chip, super fast everything, and fantastic color display!"
139,"I was hesitant buying a MacBook, I said I'd never do it. But after having my iPhone for so long I and my most recent laptop dying, I figured I could take the chance. I love it, it is basically just an iPhone in laptop form. I will miss Microsoft Office Suite, but I don't really need it for that so it is ok."
140,I jumped out of the “Ecosystem” a little while back. Last had a MacBook Pro 13” in about 2015 when we had real ports. I realize those days aren’t coming back and it’s #HubLife or #NoLife. But I’ve been underwhelmed with Apples offerings for a minute.
141,As much as I enjoy my new MacBook. It is way too soon to be experiencing loading delays. I barely have anything loaded on the computer and I have experienced several delays.
142,"I was scared jumping from my 2020 MBP-16 to a MB-Air.  But I wanted lighter and figured I could carry both if I need the power of my Pro.  Ummmm, I don't need my Pro.  This thing blows my almost brand new Intel based MBP!  Now, there have been some anomalies with different apps and things.  No show stoppers.  But you can clearly tell which apps were updated for the M1 and which weren't  They work fine, but take a several seconds to open."
143,Decided to switch from Windows and PC laptops to Apple MacBook and never turning back. Quality hardware and software and looking forward to many years of happy use. I can recommend this product.
144,"I'm not really a mac user, but I heard a lot of good stuffs on YouTube about M1 Macbook air and want to give it a try. Guess what. I don't think any Windows laptop around this price range can beat this M1 Macbook air. No fan, so it is quiet yet there is almost no heat. Battery life is insanely good. If you are looking for everyday laptop around 900-1000 bucks, this is it. Highly recommended. However, if you play games alot (especially Windows games), then this is a no go."
145,"Caveats: This is a Mac, so like any other, software choice can be limited. It's also the new ARM/M1 chip, so certain programs haven't caught up (as of early 2021), especially virtualization (VMWare, VirtualBox) and languages (Haskell).  This is a 13-inch screen, so screen real estate is limited, I couldn't recommend this as a ""daily driver"", except maybe for school/university.  Probably a great option if you're frequently on Google Meet or Zoom."
146,"Buying into the Apple ecosystem should only be done to make products for the ecosystem which will make the user money, but, do not make them a critical part of your workflow.  They are too expensive for that.  Apple just does not make good computers.  Yes, they make a OK operating system, but they make computers that cannot be repaired by taking out the ssd or ram sticks and putting new ones in."
147,"I assumed the computer was new, I’m not sure that I did not get a renewed one. The computer seems fine so far, but the charger was defective, and I had to spend 30.00 on a new aftermarket charger. You would think the product would be tested. Not a great experience."
148,"I love this laptop. It's fast, practical, sleek, portable, and very useful for me as a college student who does remote work. I have never had a problem with it and I have been using it for a few months now. 100/10."
149,"I looked at a lot of different laptops and went to my local Best Buy for in person testing before deciding on this one.  I work from home and have been using a older model HP that was passed down to me that had a hour and a half battery life, a plastic shell, and froze endlessly."
150,Had an intel based MacBook Pro that supported 2 additional displays natively. This one only supports one. Luckily has a display link hub as a workaround fo 2 additional monitors. Had no issues with M1 silicon
151,Just about the only thing I have objections to is that I don't really like the touchpad much. It doesn't always behave intuitively and I've had to tweak settings to get it to where I'm fairly comfortable using it.
152,"I was hasitating to buy used, but it was like new. No scratch, no dent, even battery charging cycle was 2. Came with box, original charger, USB-C cable. I am happy with it."
153,"First off: this computer is extremely lightweight, well built, and beautiful. Yes this is the new MacBook Air M1. And it arrived with 4 days after shipping (bad weather slowed it down so it arrived late)."
154,"Not much to say, excellent product overall. No cons except lack of ports. All day+ battery life, excellent screen. Keyboard is good as well. I have the 8 gb ram version but haven't seen any lag due to it. Use it often to run demanding simulations and it has not disappointed me so far."
155,"This laptop is perfect for student for collage. It is extremely fast however the restarting of this laptop isn’t that fast which is kind strange. Overall I find no faults with this device, I have the 8gb ram version and it performs like a champ for all my needs as a student. I totally recommend this device."
156,"It's a mac. That's literally the only reason I bought it to customize an app that was iOS compatible only. Outside of that, the Camera is horrendous (its giving very 2011 photobooth camera quality) and if you have too many browsers or apps opens it practically crashes. Not really worth the prices in my opinion. Just pay the premium for a macbook pro if the camera and performance is a make or break for you."
157,"I have buyers regret now.  I bought this to update from my old Mac Pro and was hoping I could get some streaming apps like Netflix, Hulu, etc and none of that is available.  I use my laptop for movies and TV while traveling.  No CD drive and none of the aforementioned items make this laptop basically useless to me"
158,"I used HP laptops for years, their average screen size is like 17, up to almost 20 inch screen size. For this 13 inch MacBook, at first I was surprised, but the second I set things up I got real excited. Siri is super helpful, Mac is small, very easy to carry, super convenient. One thing I like the most is the Touch ID to open laptop. After using Mac I've decided to purchase the latest iPad, Apple products actually worth the money!"
159,I’m a college student and bought this right before my semester started and it is my most favorite thing!! I was kind of hesitant it would be fake but it really is the real deal and I love my MacBook Air!
160,"There’s nothing I don’t like and I’m sure I have not explored everything in my new Air. pro, the screen quality is great, I do not have touch screen and I do not play games on the Computer only on my IPhone."
161,The track pad for this machine is too smooth for me and gives my aging hands problems. And using the arrow keys to scroll doesn't work the same as my Chromebooks. I don't see where the Retina screen is in any way superior to my Toshiba HD Chromebooks.
162,"The MacBook Air is as advertised. Fast and easy to use with a long battery life. Too few ports for my taste, and the keyboard is only OK. I use a Logitech mouse via Bluetooth, and it is responsive. One positive surprise is that the speakers in the laptop are better than those I've used in bigger machines."
163,Like any laptop this laptop has its little quirks but overall this is one of the best laptops to purchase. I don't know if this is touchscreen but its not that big of a deal for a person like me . The picture/ video quality is great to look at and is very clear but the Photo Booth camera kinda sucks which is a little disappointing . Other than these little things the laptop is  pretty fast and  has all the essential app to create .
164,"Excellent battery, speedy, lightweight. You do not often come across these three benefits together. This is still a great purchase if you (like me) do the regular zoom meetings, graphic design, edit 4k video, some spreadsheet work and occasionally edit batches of 100 photos in raw format in Lightroom. Go spend some more in a M1 Pro or Max if you really need that much computational power for 3d or heavy 8k video editing."
165,This purchase for me was an upgrade from a old MacBook Pro I’ve been using for over 4 years got a refurbished MacBook Pro 2012 for Christmas 4 years ago so I when I saw the 2020 MacBook Air new not refurbished for 899 bucks I jumped on it and I’m glad I did because it’s a great MacBook fast efficient I edit videos for YouTube everyday and this MacBook does it way faster than my old slow MacBook Pro so I’m very happy a must buy for sure
166,I love this computer. It is very light and easy to travel with. It is not air cooled so not hot bottom or the noise of a fan cooling system. Was super easy to set up.
167,"I’ve owned Mac’s for over 25 years and this is the worst I’ve ever owned. First off, the mouse buttons are a new horrible design that often do not recognize mouse clicks. Clicking this mouse is the worst experience I’ve ever had on any computer before. My previous 2018 Mac was much better in so many ways."
168,"I left the Apple product line years ago due to their practice of ""forced obsolesce"" with early iPhone models. Having worked in IT for most of my career I like being able to have full control of my device. Apple mostly locks up their devices."
169,"What I liked: Apple's construction quality is second to none. Unboxing this is a delight, it's just a beautiful machine. You can start working with it as soon as the initial setup is done, which might take a few minutes. Love the display, bright colors, nice resolution, everything looks crisp. Keys are a delight to type with, real smooth. Battery life is the best I've ever witnessed, I just recharge this thing every other day, whereas my previous laptop would use three rounds of charge a day (and I had for just one year)."
170,"Had mine since April and I gotta tell you, I’m literally lost for words. I won’t make this length cause I don’t have to, all you need to know is that this is a must have for anyone wanting to get productivity and entertainment out of a laptop."
171,"The MacBook Air is an amazing machine! I absolutely love it!!! I only wish that it had more ports on it. Not a huge deal because I bought a hub for more ports, but would have been nice to see more ports on this thing. Other than that, I love how responsive it is, and I love the picture quality! Also, the battery life on this thing is unreal!!! I have left it off the charger for well over a week and have not needed to charge it. It is amazing!!!"
172,"Everything about this machine has been fantastic.  I could not afford new, but I have found this only a hairsbreadth less than spanking new.  Best for me, since I was away from the wonderful Apple side for several years, Apple help is as fine as the machine.  Plan to go this route next time."
173,I got this for school after my hp computer's battery stopped working. It's really great for the price! the screen resolution is really nice and the touch id is a good add on. I really wish apple would make touch screen macbooks but they probably never will. it also doesn't have a usb port which is kind of weird. learning the controls takes some time but overall a great computer!
174,The computer is everything I thought it would be. Gave the camera a 3 star because quality could be better but I don’t use FaceTime as much so it’s not a big deal to me. Overall so worth the money. Great investment for my book writing and finances.
175,Price point for an apple laptop good. Screen is great so are the speakers. Dead easy to set up. I had my last one for 13 years hope this is the same. Only negative. The new usb-c ( lightning ) does not support the apple super drive. You have to buy an adapter.
176,"Smaller form than the Macbook Air it replaced but screen size was the same. Lighter, too! The rose gold is beautiful and the computer works incredibly well and is lightning fast. Migration assistant made data transfer from old to new a piece of cake. Absolutely love it!"
177,"I gave this purchase a run around and delayed purchasing it for a good while, but I cant stress enough how amazing this computer has been. I take it around with me for studying and playing music and just basic stuff but is amazing, the m1 chip is quite a game changer."
178,Love this Mac.  Arrived fast and packaged well.  Works great and as a first time Mac user it was very easy to learn.  Great price at Amazon and very happy with the purchase.  The computer is very fast.
179,"This Macbook was good until the screen started to glitch on the bottom and left side of the display. Apple said the screen didn't have damage, but needs to be replaced. It's 14 months old, outside of the one year warranty, and a new display costs $428. I will not be buying another Macbook in the future."
180,"Love apple, but wish it was easier to adapt and find thing after using windows for so long. I have to search in safari for answers. Once, I figure out everything I will be much happier because it is so much faster."
181,I needed a new computer and this one is just right for me. Very easy to set up and user friendly. I don't know a lot about computers but my sons said I made a good choice with this one. The rose gold is a fun color and a change from drab gray or silver.
182,"I've worked on and serviced Macs for many years, but I've never considered purchasing one for the price. Macs have never been a good value. I wanted a $1000 laptop, and my choices quickly narrowed to this. It has the best laptop processor and the best screen money can buy, especially at this price. The battery life on MacBooks is always good, so I knew that wouldn't be an issue."
183,"This is my 4th Mac laptop, the earlier ones were all MacBook Pros.  I was reticent about getting an Air, but with the M1 chip, this thing is a superb replacement.  So small & light, yet speedy.  Only drawback is the fixed 8GB RAM complement.  I take care not to send the thing into swap- suspending old browser tabs is essential."
184,"I had a 2008 MacBook Pro that I used until 2014. I then switched back to a PC until purchasing this M1 MacBook a month ago. I don’t know why I haven’t been using a Mac sooner. Having messages and FaceTime and synced with my phone, along with MS office functionality makes this computer a dream to use."
185,"Like the updated M1 processor.  Like the extra memory.  Don't like the ""Left outs"".  No lighted apple logo on the cover.  It was replaced by a mirror like decal. (Cheap)  Don't like the lack of ports.  No HCMI, no SDHC memory slot for you camera memory chip, you need to buy adaptor for USBC and there are only 2 on the left none on the right only a 3.5 mm audio jack. In addition when charging the unit there is no indication, no light no sound, nothing that lets you know it is charging."
186,"My first Apple product. Great hardware and software. Coming from Windows Lifer, it had been no problem getting upto speed on Big Sur. Got it on promotion too for 850. No brainer."
187,"First time owning a MacBook, I didn't want to cheap out on a good computer for school so I chose this and it does not fail to deliver. Very responsive and runs smooth when operating, I even don't mind using it without a mouse as it's trackpad is excellent. Crazy how this thing is so quiet. Very happy with the purchase!"
188,"I absolutely love this computer and all of it's features! It was well protected and packaged throughout the shipment, so I didn't have any damage to my new computer when I received it."
189,"I tried several other higher cost laptops. Namely Windows based.  I was dissatisfied, display resolution was lacking, battery life, etc...  Looked at the new MacBook Air and purchased it.  I am satisfied with it, no regrets!!!  Seems like it was created by people in the future! ;)"
190,I have zero complaints. I’ve always heard wonderful things about Apple computers.  I wish I made this purchase a long time ago. Would have avoided headaches and could have saved myself a lot of money on cheap laptops.
191,Bought the 8 gig ram model works great. Unless you’re running a lot of concurrent apps you don’t need 16 gig. This machine is fast and beautiful. By far the best laptop I found and believe me I thought a lot of them during the last 40 years!
192,Bough this for my mom. Battery life is great & it’s so sleek that we can take it anywhere without it taking up space. also the price for this is great I couldn’t find a better deal anywhere else.
193,"Love my new MacBook Air!! Light, sleek, long lasting battery, plug & play! Surprised it does not have regular USB ports, but ordered 2-pack of USB to USB-C adapters for $10. Love all my Apple products from their packaging to their long lasting durability and fantastic performance/technology."
194,"Love the lightweight and easy to set up/configure capabilities.  This is my first MAC although I have iPads and an Apple watch.  Though it might be scary to move from Windows, but not at all.  Like all Apple products - everything was seamless.  Great price as well.."
195,"I use it everyday for my Red Cross volunteer work. Gets tricky switching between my MAC, iPad & iPhone but that’s on me. I wished more apps were compatible over PCs."
196,"This was a gift for Christmas for my daughter who will be graduating in May 2021 and going off to college.  So, I wish I could give more feedback on it, my oldest has a bigger apple laptop and loves it for her school assignments she’s in a nursing program."
197,It was time to update a pc laptop and and took the plunge and switch to an apple product. It's a great system and works well with my other apple products ie iPhone/AirPods. I especially like the fingerprint function. Nothing to complain about for this user.
198,I was skeptical at first but now I’m convinced!  ARM Is like the cpu in the terminator movies! lol. No fan and battery last all day easily!  It absolutely crushes my 6 core i7 MacBook Pro on Geekbench test!  You will not regret buying one!  Look at the picture and see for yourself!
199,"I had an 11-inch Mac Air Book, upgraded to the 13.3 version and I love it; easier to use, still infinitely portable. Smooth and seamless to use. Thanks so much"
200,"I love my Mac book Air.  Very easy to use.  I love that everything goes to iPhone, iPad and Mac book and I don't have to do anything.  I have not began to use all of the 100's of features.  Extremely pleased."
201,"I only charge it every few days, battery is awesome on it so far. Still getting used to using a Mac after only ever having a windows laptop but so far so good."
202,"I’ve had the same MacBook Pro for 7 years and it was finally time to get a new one. I wasn’t sure about the Air, but I’m so happy I went with it! Not a bad price, shipped very quickly, battery lasts a long time, I just love it."
203,"Love this lap top but it’s ridiculous that it doesn’t have an usb or hdmi, so if you plan to buy MacBooks then get the adapter too. Otherwise you won’t be able to connect your phone to your laptop."
204,"Idk why I’d expect for it to be any less than perfect , for the price I paid it just better had been !!! Lol it’s just what I wanted .. I totally forget about my phone because I’m so happy about my new labtop! Lol💞"
205,"So I have never bought any Apple laptops off Amazon but it did arrive wrapped and packaged as if it came from Apple itself. Battery life is great, keyboard is great and it’s light. I don’t use laptop cameras so I can’t say either way on how good it is or isn’t."
206,Love it!! I ordered it last night and it arrived this morning! Super efficient delivery and the product came intact! Thank you Amazon! The laptop is very sleek looking and light to carry. I have found it very user friendly and super customizable! Definitely recommend. :)
207,"I’m really happy with this purchase because I’ve wanted a MacBook for a long time and when I finally wanted to save up for it the day I bought it, it went to 899 and I was happy"
208,Beautiful device. Perfect for simply web browsing and ideal for teachers like myself that need to use Microsoft Office and Google Classroom etc. Definitely worth every penny. Treat yourself if you’ve been debating this over a PC laptop.
209,This was exactly what I was looking for. Got the beautiful Rose Gold colored edition which had been sold out in stores every time I looked. Fast delivery that arrived a day earlier than expected. Everything I wanted with no hassles.
210,"Such a great laptop! I got this to replace my horrible PC and Chrome book, because they lag so much. This laptop is so compact and lighting fast! Such a great investment!"
211,"Long battery life, super fast processing speed, cool fanless operation, lightweight, high build quality.  The M1 is an amazing step above Intel based laptops.  Easily my best laptop in last 10 years."
212,I don’t use it much I’m starting online college in the next few months. It’s my first Apple laptop so I’m pretty happy with it. I do use it at times and it never heats up.
213,"We bought this computer out of insistence from my husband. He knew I wasn't an Apple/Mac fan, but this computer had made reconsider everything related to electronics. It's fast, efficient and simple."
214,"Overall great computer, my last MacBook Air was 8 years old so this is a great replacement BUT super disappointed that the charging cord isn’t magnetic like the old style"
215,The M1 is so fast. And I really like that they changed to keyboard on this model. They are raised more so I can actually feel when I'm pressing on them.
216,other being delivered late. it was perfect gpu and cpu are crazy fast so is the ssd and ram. it may be the best computer i have ever have had.
217,No complains so far.  Very fast and performs great.  I had a 2014 MacBook Air and finally upgraded this year.  This is leagues beyond that entry and I’m very happy with this upgrade.
218,"It's a great computer, very sturdy and strong. You have to take good care of it, though, if you get little crumbs inside the keyboard, it'll obviously stop working. Also, the gold color isn't really gold, it's more of a pink shade."
219,"This low-end MacBook Air performs incredibly. It handles Lightroom and Photoshop like it's nothing. I can't believe the battery life as well - it'll run all day. I don't know how Apple did it, but they did. Very satisfied with this laptop."
220,I went everywhere attempting to purchase this MacBook. I couldn't even get it from apple since there's no in-store purchasing .. I was able to find and recieve within 1 day via amazon. As for the laptop itself Wonderful ... If you're considering I highly recommend.
221,"The video quality is extremely poor, I have a Macbook Air from a previous employer without this issue. But the camera is extremely grainy and unfocused. Returning since most of my work is giving video presentations."
222,I love MAC laptops. They are reliable and this one has the newest processor which is very fast and the screen has no frame. The only issue that this causes is a lot of finger smudges from opening it or adjusting the screen.
223,The speed is great compared to the older model I had. The one pain I have is exporting most documents I send out into PDF since almost of the people who I send to are on a window's platform.
224,"I absolutely love my new laptop it is 20x better than my other laptop because the battery life lasts longer and I can multitask multiple assignments all at the same time; also, it is a very reliable and the resolution and speed is amazing"
225,idk what to say but this crazy MacBook is awesome apple makes a sweet ass tv. thanks apple for adding the extra keyboard for tapping on zzzzoooommmm!!!! its a really I am trying to figure the ins and outs of this thing always finding new stuff.
226,I am extremely happy with the MacBook Air but more impressed with the simplicity and efficiency of the Amazon ordering process.  The lengths Amazon has gone to provide an incredible purchasing process is impressive.  Amazon has a customer for life
227,M1 chip blows away any laptop on the market. It even blows away the pro version of this laptop. No internal fan and loss of efficiency is virtually non existent. Highly recommend
228,"It's an apple product, so it always lives up (or even surpasses) the expectation. My daughter loves the color and the size. Now I feel like I need one myself!"
229,"Love my new Mac !  It’s very light, battery lasts a long time. Days even - with light use.  Charges quickly too.  I haven’t bought a case yet - it’s too gorgeous to cover up!  But will buy a sleeve for transporting when I travel. No complaints.  LOVE IT."
230,"Needless to say, I love my Macbook Air. This is the first time I purchased a laptop that's apple. I have owned one in the past, but it felt good actually purchasing my own this time. Now I not only have an Ipad, Apple Watch, Apple phone but I now have an Apple Macbook Air."
231,"Did not like the color. The gold is NOT gold, rather rose gold. So this is a misrepresentation on the color. If you think it will be true gold color, you will be disappointed. It looks and is rose gold has a pink color to the gold."
232,"Best computer i have ever had, very good job Apple. Comparing to many brands HP, Acer, Dell, etc this is a rocket based on price, speed, image, performance, everything. just the best buy you can ever have, dont doubt it for a second."
233,"Beautiful laptop. I’ve upgraded from the MacBook Air of old...so far this laptop has blown it away. It wasn’t overly pricey to be honest and I feel it’s worth the price. Overall look is great and keyboard feel is nice. Larger touchpad is great, I’ve paired my Magic Trackpad 2 with it as well."
234,"I have own a apple iPad and now this ,it is everything I could ask for in a laptop.I have own several other laptops made by different manufacturers and everyone failed me! this is far better and very easy to setup I had no problems setting it up at all! very pleased and would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a fast and powerful laptop!"
235,This has been the best purchase I have made in a very long time. My computer can go days without needed a recharge and has a sheik finish. I have shared this link with many already. The greatest of all is that it last for years!
236,This MacBook is super fast and convenient to use. Typical Apple quality but yes you will have to pay a price for it.  The M1 chip is amazing and worth it.  Wish the bezels weren't as big but you can't get everything right?  Highly recommend if you are a fan of Apple. Very lightweight and portable.
237,It’s amazing. It has everything I need and more to be able to stay on track from day to day life. It’s by far the best to me out there right now
238,"First venture into Mac. Laptop has some heft to it with a nice aluminum chassis. Screen is sharp, very bright and responsive. Keyboard is on par with other laptops I use daily (Lenovo). Blows standard laptops out of the water with battery life."
239,The battery life in this laptop exceeds everything I've ever seen before. On a full charge after being on standby for a week I still have 90% battery left. In the past I've always been afraid to leave my laptop for any period of time without shutting it down. Now I never shut it down. an occupational reboot after an update or something is all it needs.
240,"I love my MacBook, battery is so good. Camera isn’t amazing but it’s pretty good, but you have to remember…. This is a laptop. Prefect for zoom!  So as long as your not taking your MacBook on a photo shoot, camera quality is great! Screen is small. But it’s fine! Lighter than a feather!"
241,"This is replacing a 11 inch air that I spilled a beer on.  I pretty much love everything about it except the bigger size and heavier weight.  Battery life is amazing.  Speed, still hard to get used to."
242,"This is the first Apple computer I've ever had and I adore my Mac. I originally bought it for editing my videos for my YouTube channel (Rae of Sun Asmr) which is still its main function. Now however, I almost prefer watching things like Netflix, etc. on here vs on my actual television. Picture quality on this thing is superior. Highly recommend."
243,Never owned a Mac and now never going back to Windows.  So smooth and fast with phenomenal battery life up to 8+ hours. Great screen as well with backlit keyboard. Easy to transfer files from Windows.  This is money well spent replacing a 5+ years old slow heavy HP laptop!
244,"My whole experience with ordering a MacBook off of amazon was amazing. It was smooth and easy, and showed up to my front door extremely early. I would venture to say that it was one of my favorite purchases and amazon made it that much easier. I would recommend for anybody to do this same thing."
245,"This is my first MacBook and I like it for the price, but touchbar isa bit weird. As i find out this is not fault apple just have this kind of touchbars. I had acer predator helios 300 before this and it has much better toucbar. Much comfortable in every aspect."
246,"I'm a PC guy, not a apple fanboy. Credit where is deserved though, Apple does make nice if overpriced devices. It definitely has the best screen of any laptop I've bought. The M1 battery life and performance is quite impressive for a laptop for this size and price. Keyboard is good too. Points deducted for apple pulling it's usual crap.... Only 8 gigs of ram and 256 of storage. Lack of ports too."
247,"This new Mac is more powerful than all previous versions, runs silent (no fans), dissipates heat under the heaviest of loads with no throttling, and does so while lasting 48 hours on a chafe and being almost as light as your phone."
248,"We bought the laptop in Dec 2021. After a couple of weeks, it had a big OS update: Big Sur to Monterey. The problems started happening - I kept getting locked out, passwords not working, account name not working - resulting to my having to run to the Mac Service Center 2x."
249,"What’s not to like? It’s a great Apple product! Bought to replace a 2013 MacBook Pro that worked flawlessly right up until it was destroyed in an accident. Setting it up and getting on with my life was pretty seamless, as it has been on every Apple product I’ve ever upgraded. I’m enjoying the increased speed and more up to date features as a bonus — especially longer battery life!"
250,"Bought this for my mom, she wanted to use a mouse. I gave her one of my old mouse. Where is the usb port? 20 more dollars for an addon for usb ports!, 720 camera still on a 2020 product come one!"
251,"El rendimiento del equipo es genial, la duración de la batería es asombrosa, cumple con todas funciones descritas, lastima que solo tiene 2 puertos tipo C, pero con la compra de un Hub se soluciona el problema. En resumen una muy buena adquisición de mi parte."
252,Got it for my daughter for school. I asked her after she spent some time with it- how is it? Her response was- I LIKE IT!!! That answers all my questions! That's all I want to know. Apple 🍎👌
253,"If you're a heavy user, go for the 16 gig model. The 8 gigs 8s good enough for day to day task, plus the battery is unbelievable.  Easily goes for 2 days without worries"
254,"I had a MacBook Pro that is over ten years old and has served me well, but it was time to upgrade. Happy so far, the light weight is awesome, keyboard is excellent and quiet, so far so good!"
255,"Nothing wrong with the system, but it took more than 2 weeks to arrive, and in the process, the M2 dropped in price. So I'll return this and get the M2.  A waste of my time when I could have used it most.  The wait was really disappointing."
256,"This is my first laptop and I’m real happy with the purchase. The speakers on this are nice and loud I love it. The size is a great size, not too big and definitely not too small, it’s just right. The screen is great too love the picture quality and it gets brights. I’m not super in tune with all the laptop lingo and things that matter but as a person who just bought their first laptop, definitely worth it."
257,"Unexpectedly this turned out to be a espectacular laptop. Yes, some applications are still not available natively for the M1 chip but even through emulation they are very fast to use. Camera despite having the same.720p res it has a better image quality and I assume this is due to the chip processing image better than intel. For everyday use this is perfect for other tasks such as programming not yet."
258,Blazing fast!  This was my first Mac and I was Only familiar with iOS devices so I can compare to past models. But I can say that the MacBooks with the M1 chips our as fast as an iPad when it comes to light duty things.
259,"I'm absolutely stunned by this laptop, it's pefect in every way. Super fast with incredible screen quality and the outside color (rose gold) is beautiful!! It's extremely light and can be carried anywhere. I did get a protector because I was afraid to damage it since it's so light I felt like I could add a bit of protection so I put a clear plastic case and it still feels very thin and light."
260,"The m1 MacBook Air is the perfect machine blending the best aspects of cell phone computing with the functionality of a laptop. This means unparalleled performance, amazing battery life, and beautiful screen quality. Along with these improvements the keyboard is also refined and no longer used the dreaded scissor mechanism. The only improvement I could ask for is the webcam."
261,This is a replacement for my 11 year old MacBook Pro that still works but I’m glad to have this new MacBook Pro Air. It’s battery life is far better that my old one and I am enjoying its much lighter weight. Amazon’s price was the best I could find and with my Prime Chase card I am buying it interest free.
262,"So far this has been a wonderful purchase. The processor is so fast, that’s what I noticed the most is how fast it is. Super excited to get the M1 ship at such a discounted rate."
263,"This might be one of the best MacBooks currently in the market, but it has limited functionality compared to Windows PCs and even certain Chromebook features. The MacBook Air has a beautiful screen but no touchscreen support. It also has an excellent trackpad. However, the MacBook doesn't allow you to perform certain basic features without paying for additional software to access them. For example, you can't snap multiple windows next to each other as you simply would on Windows PCs and Chromebooks."
264,"Currently writing this review on the laptop Everything about it is amazing. This could be the best laptop ever made by apple as the m1 chip is mind-blowingly fast. Keyboard and touchpad feel are amazing. Convenience is unmatched with all of the built in features that work seamlessly. For students, there's no better option for this great of a value."
265,"This computer lived up to and surpassed my highest expectations. I could not recommend it more. The battery life is surreal. The screen is gorgeous. It is snappy, fast, and outperforms my much more expensive previous gen Macs. Such an incredible feat of engineering."
266,I love this laptop.  I was a die-hard PC / Android person prior but my experience with this product is really pushing me to the Apple world... Also the keyboard rules compared to the old butterfly keyboard they had previously.
267,"YOU WILL NEVER REGRET THIS PURCHASE IF YOU ARE A MAC PERSON.  IT IS GOOD FOR PC PERSONS AS LONG AS THEY ARE WILLING TO TAKE A LITTLE TIME TO LEARN HOW TO USE IT, AS IT IS DIFFERENT FROM A PC.  SOME SOFTWARE IS MORE DIFFICULT TO FIND."
268,First MacBook and I am in love! I have been using my computer for two days and still have 60% battery life. Very impressive because I have been using it a lot. I’m still getting use to the different feel on how to use it but it really is self explanatory once you start using it.
269,"Llego hasta las puertas de mi caso en un estado excelente como si lo hubiera comprado en una tienda, vino sellada, es parecida es l software y su arreglo a las otras Mac igual de organizadas, trabaja bastante rápido, pero hay que reconocer que la calidad de la cámara es menor que las generaciones anteriores."
270,"This is the second MacBook I’ve owned. The first one lasted 11 years. Apple makes a quality product. The MacBook Air is lightweight, responsive and excellent graphics. I continue to invest in only Apple products."
271,As usual I am really impressed with the  product and also the efficiency on handling my purchase.....the United States  post office really should look at Amazon and Apple on how to run a business! ....just saying....
272,"This computer is a good buy and works very well. My only complaint is that I have been a pc user all of my life (more than 60 years) and I am having some challenges with the OS. Not their fault. Delivery, packaging, speed, and everything seems really good. I am satisfied."
273,"The M1 chip is amazing and a miracle, this little chip can play some of the most cpu demand games around cities skylines it played phenomenal without any lag or freezing. This MacBook Air is very powerful. the downside to it, is that it doesn't have a cooling fan and one cooling fan in it would make a major improvement."
274,"I love, love, love this computer. I just love the fact of having everything in the cloud. When I try to look at some file that I was working on my MacBook from my phone, it will come up quickly and fast. Everything is synced. Love the keyboard, the features, the color and texture of it, will definitely stay with Apple!"
275,I have had the M1 MacBook Air 13-inch now since December 2020. It has served me so well and has been one of the most reliable laptops I've ever owned. I am originally a PC guy and now work back and forth between Windows OS and Mac OS.
276,I’ve had a 2012 MacBook Pro and it’s still running good just a lil slow. Now to upgrade to this MacBook Air not a big difference but runs way smoother
277,Was bought as a graduation gift for my daughter. Display quality and sound from the built in speakers is exceptional. She currently  only uses it for Netflix and YouTube until college starts in a few weeks though lol.
278,"this item is very good. I buy it for my son who is going to college in Shouth DAKOTA  at MOUNT MARTY university, He is happy and am happy for him."
279,I'm a software developer and I've only used PC for my entire career. I've been using the windows subsystem for Linux and other Unix based shells for work for a long time and I've always had the desire to try development on a Mac.
280,"Almost everything is top-notch: Performance, battery life, new magic keyboard, usual unparalleled trackpad, quality of materials and build. I was a little concerned about lower screen brightness of MB Air versus MB Pro prior to purchase, but have no complaints. Only feature less than excellent is camera, which is only 720p. Limited ports only a minor inconvenience. Most highly recommended."
281,This Mac is the fastest that I have had. Wakeup is instant. The fingerprint reader is exceptional. Screen quality is tops. Connectivity to external devices is simple and easy. Very satisfied
282,"Replaced a 10 year old MacBook pro (spinning harddrive, one-hour batter life, spinning beach balls).  Updates are smooth and backing up is seamless.  Able to set it up to limit the tech to just what she needs (right click, what does that do?).  She was very hesitant to get a new computer, as her old one ""works"".  6 months later, she said she wouldn't go back.  Its light with a for-ever battery life.  Thanks, Apple!"
283,"Attractive gold colour that looks like rose gold, lightweight, speedy. Ideal for browsing the internet, reading emails, Microsoft Office. Purchased brand new from the Apple Store on Amazon - ""Ship and Sold by Amazon"". Received in pristine condition with one year Apple Warranty."
284,"The item is great, allows me to be productive without worrying about performance being an issue. It was shipped quickly and arrived at my front door just 5 days after purchasing. Highly recommend this laptop for those who don’t need the highest specs but, can get by doing mostly everything you throw at it just fine."
285,"This is a very good computer. Very fast and works with most people.... but, some apps just don't work. They used to work in my other Macbook pro. but on this M1 it simple won't work.... apps like Google drive!!!! for good sake!"
286,"You get what you pay for, and that $1000 I dropped on this MacBook was worth. I went through a few cheap laptops that went from $200-400 bc I needed it for my college classes and then after wasting my time buying and returning them,  I finally decided to go all out and no regrets with this purchase. 10/10"
287,I absolutely love this MacBook!! It has a finger print scan to unlock it and to fill in passwords which is so handy. The battery life lasts for a long time. The screen quality is flawless. It’s super fast and comes with so many useful apps on it!
288,This has everything I could possibly want in a laptop and more! I love being able to use my fingerprint to access my laptop! It is thin and light for easy portability as well! Definitely recommend!
289,"I purchased this at the beginning of March, and for the past month, I have found out that this has been really efficient for me. I have been able to use this laptop for multiple school purposes and even stream movies and tv shows which has been really nice for me. The battery efficiency is also really nice I must add."
290,"I've had a variety of Apple equipment in my life-- but also Microsoft Surface, Surface Laptops, Chromebooks, and more. I'm an open minded technology user and tend to go with best of breed or technology that pushes the envelope of what is possible. I like well designed hardware that looks and feels good, and works well."
291,"The new M1 chip is extremely fast and extremely power efficient. Oh, and it doesn't even need fans. Handles 4k resolution great, and is super light and thin. I just wish Apple would decide to add touchscreens to Macs..."
292,"Fast. Battery life never an issue. I wanted the same keys on the keyboard as the pro. Anything else was nothing but perfect! Ohhh and I wanted a whole Touch Bar, not one key for ID."
293,"As a long time windows user. I used to not really want an apple laptop at all. As I suppose apple item were so interior and always so heavy compared to premium line windows machine. However, I will admit in USA, apple give you the best choice all around. It is just lovely, indeed, it is about 50% heavier than the old I gave to my girl friend one year ago. But most others are just admirable. I list four points here."
294,"I don't get the hype about M1 chip. Half of my programs aren't compatible with it and some aren't updated anymore so there is a little hope for a fix. The camera is horrible as well, picture quality is worse then what my 3 years old smartphone produces"
295,"This is one of the best purchases I have ever made. I truly love it, and believe it is the best air ever made. No plans to upgrade anytime Sumer. Truly revolutionary in the laptop genre. Cheers Apple!"
296,"It’s an M1 chipped MacBook Air, has the previous version and this is the best one so far battery lasts a long time, even with hours of straight use, does not get hot while charging and no fans to hear !! Yippee."
297,I JUST GOT IT TODAY I MADE THE RIGHT DECISION ORDERING IT HERE. I HAVE NO ISSUE BOUT IT AT ALL I GAVE IT 4 STARS BECAUSE THERE IS A TINY DENT NOT A BIG DEAL.
298,i love it! i’ve had it for about 2 weeks now and it’s the best laptop i’ve ever owned. i do play games on it (mainly sims) and it doesn’t lag or mess up which i’m happy with. great buy and i’m happy i bought it!
299,I decided to treat myself this year to this. Ordered it on the Apple website and was told 1-2 weeks. I ordered it on Amazon and it was here in 2 days for the same price! Love this! As for the product ... you can not go wrong with Apple. I was a little shook by the price but its worth every penny.
300,"Coming from a long history of Windows computers, this is by far the best laptop I have ever owned for home use. The price could not be beaten at $850 at the time, and I couldn't be happier."
301,"an excellent option, for work, have some problem with docker!! (for developers guys) the rest all very well, the screen, and the sound, and options are good, we only recommend a base for MacBook, for some heat in the down of the laptop, but I think is because don't have Forced ventilation for the Processor."
302,"Replaced a previous MacBook Air with the new version. Same sleek design, upgraded performance. The computer is quick and easy to use. Plus it is lighter than the 2011 version I replaced."
303,I use this for college and it is great! It was really difficult to learn how to use. It is so different from an IPhone. But it loads quick and is beautiful. It picks up finger prints more than your phone does and you can really see them too so make sure to wash your screen but besides that it is amazing! Especially for the price I got it for of $850!
304,"This is a phenomenal laptop and not just at its price point. The M1 chip is snappy and fast, the battery life is amazing and the screen quality is excellent. All of that is bundled in a thin, light and quiet (fan-less) form factor. I’d highly recommend this MacBook Air unless you want to run high intensity games (they just aren’t native to Mac OS and won’t run as well as they will on Windows)."
305,"I have purchased at amazon many times, I am satisfied with all products, about this macbbok air m1 works very well and the price is very good, I think I should hurry to own it, this can also be a gift."
306,"Love it. I wish they would upgrade the damn cameras but it does the job. I’m not using it to take photos. But as far meetings go it would be nice. I didn’t realize I was running like 6 different programs. This thing performs without any slow down. I learn something new about it everyday. I love that my phone, my watch and my laptop all talk to each other. So no matter where I write it is saved to the iCloud. Happy with my purchase. Got the headphones and Magic Mouse too. No complaints here."
307,"I’ve read amazing things about Apple’s new chips but I was still blown away by how well everything worked.  Zero fan noise (possibly zero fan, period), can play all the games I care about (Factorio/FTL/Rimworld/LoL/FFXIV), and everything is snappy as hell."
308,"Coming from a long history of Windows computers, this is by far the best laptop I have ever owned for home use. The price could not be beaten at $850 at the time, and I couldn't be happier."
309,"I gave my wife this new MacBook Air as a gift 3 months ago. She is very careful with it. She opens it last night and the screen is garbled. There's a hairline crack in it leading from the left edge. It wasn't dropped. It wasn't pressed on, sat on, or kept under books. In other words it was NORMAL use when the damn thing stopped working."
310,"I am one of the thousands that have come back to their laptop the next day only to find black vertical lines.  This has happened twice (I bought the computer in August 2021) .  Apple fixed the screen the first time, but are now asking for 514 dollars, claiming that I damanged the screen.  I did not!  This problem is so common there are two class action lawsuits that have been filed against Apple.  They purposely sold a computer that they knew would develop cracks with opening or closing it."
311,"The M1 chip really is amazing. But it only lasted five days for me. Somehow mine managed to break after using a third party USB C hub. The screen wouldn’t turn on at all, and an Apple repair tech couldn’t figure it out after doing a few quick tests. Oh and then Apple said it would take a month to replace it with a new one."
312,It amazes me how much praise Apple seems to be getting for an out dated design and user interface.  Where is the touch interface and pen input especially since it is supposed to run IPad apps?  Where is the flexibility of a 2 in 1 that we have had available for years?  Apple has basically given us a fast dinosaur with a pretty face.
313,Apple USED to make great computers... Past tense! I've used them for many (almost 20) years but recently bought this computer in December and my sentiments about this brand has completely changed. How the mighty have fallen!
314,"Great out of the box, then slowly the battery life started decreasing, the constant hard reboots to get Safari back up and running, inexplicably running hot, and crashing more often than a Windows machine. Simply plugging in the power adapter is enough to crash the system followed by the necessary reboot."
315,Be aware the screen is extremely delicate and prone to break for no apparent reason. Apple won't acknowledge the design fault and now there is a class action law suite. Stay away from the AIR unless you enjoy expensive repair bills.
316,"Like thousands of other people, the screen started flickering after about 2 months. Then it went completly black. Apple store said my only option was pay over $400 to fix the screen. Apple call center said they can only take a complaint and my only option is to pay the money the store said to fix their defective product. Google to find out more. Don't by this defective product, Apple says it is not covered by its warranty because it is the customer fault. But, it is happening to 1000s of people and they know it is actually their fault."
317,"I was using a 2015 MacBook Pro for doing video editing for my church, and when I saw the specs on the M1 based MacBook Pro, I upgraded for faster processing.  My existing system has an Apple monitor, wi-fi keyboard and mouse, and a WD 3 TB external drive."
318,"I traded in my previous MacBook Air for the current version with the M1 chip. I have only had it for four days and all I can say is wow! I didn't think I would notice much of a difference, but I am very impressed with the speed and the battery life of this new edition. I mainly use my laptop for emailing, paying bills, and web browsing, and I purchased this model instead of the Pro because I don't edit or shoot videos. This model is perfect for my needs."
319,"Absolutely incredible. Apple has outdone themselves with this new M1 chip. If you are Windows user looking for a new laptop, and you are okay with trying out macOS, I would say this purchase is a no-brainer."
320,"okay so, pretty great laptop. it doesn’t overheat, the camera is better than my previous macbook, and it runs pretty well. the only problem i have is that extensions like chrome keep crashing. as a student using google meet and zoom for 7 hours a day i really can’t be crashing in the middle of a class. i’m not big on tech, so i’m not that picky, but i hope this problem sorts itself out."
321,"Granted I'm coming off a MBP 8/500 dual-core i5, but this thing is read-my-mind fast.  I keep quitting apps out of habit when you just don't need to.  Keyboard is back to pre-butterfly goodness, sound is great, and with a dock like the Anker 7-in-1 you will not mind the port count.  GarageBand and iMovie never miss a beat.  On geekbench, these new M1 units are surpassed only by the xeon Mac & iMac Pros and the 8-core i9 iMac.  Same no-go apps as Catalina, so no real surprises.  Can't wait for more universal binary apps, it'll only get better."
322,"Yes there are bezels but honestly who cares?  This package delivers an extremely strong value as someone who spends most of their time in a browser, working on excel and word.  Chrome has not posed any issues so far with many extensions and two profiles running simultaneously as of the time of writing mid december.  8gb of ram is more than enough to run a multitude of apps thanks to apple's strong os optimization."
323,"I run 11ish, an investment website and channel on youtube. I was hesitant about whether this laptop will handle video editing or not since I came from a 2016 macbook pro, but this has outperformed it through and through! Fast and reliable. The only problem I ran into was actually migrating past iMovie content over"
324,"No complains so far. Very fast and performs great. I had a 2020 March version of MacBook Pro and I think this November release is better.  Battery life is much better and also, audio and video seem improved compare to older release."
325,"Junk.  For $1000, I'm gonna need a little more than a 256GB ssd that can't ever be upgraded or replaced because it's soldered to the MB.  When the SSD goes, the whole thing is worthless.  Or inversely, if the MB dies, you can't remove the drive to get your data.  It's like they are trying to fill up landfills with garbage on purpose."
326,"Don't be fulled by 13"" description. Its bigger! And much heavier! New Air completely lost its purpose to be small and light laptop that is convenient on the go. If I wanted a bigger and more capable laptop I would have bought a PRO not an AIR. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make a normal size AIR"
327,"Bad Apple! Battery always drop dead without any reason. Sometimes, it is still 90% of battery, but it dropped dead in the middle of nowhere, or freeze, the screen just freezes 10 times a day at least. I have to force it to power off and on 10 times a day at least. I only have the Mac Air for 3+ Years, totally a junk!"
328,"Dropped about $2500 on 3 of these roughly 3 years ago.  One had battery issues, one had logic board failure which Apple would not cover, and 3rd is doing fine.  Apple has kept up with design quality, camera is top notch, but does not meet quality expectations overall.  With the reduced cost of Windows machines, may be time to step out of my Apple bubble."
329,They really should issue a recall on this particular model. The screen cracks on its own and yet Apple denies there is an issue. Going to be exchanging this for an older model that at least will last.
330,GRAINY UNUSABLE CAMERA. DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP. OR ANY LATEST 2020 MODEL - APPLE REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE ISSUE. WHAT A DISGRACE FOR A COMPANY LIKE APPLE CUSTOMER SERVICE TO REFUSE TO ACCEPT THE FLAW.
331,"I love everything Apple did to update the Air. It’s, by far, the best laptop you can buy right now. That’s especially true if you were a Mac user before. I wasn’t, so I had to learn where everything was and what not, but it didn’t take to long."
332,"This is a great desktop. I have it paired with a Dell hi res display I purchased with my old Mac. My old Mac was getting unreliable (2015). This air is very similar to the Mac but faster, reliable. I like the larger touch pad and don't have to use a wireless mouse. I have a USB type C HUB to get more connectivity. Keyboard is great."
333,"If you are planning on using a dock/dongle with this, you might want to wait. Having TONS of issues with USB not working via dock/dongle. Has happened with a few different brand/models of docks/dongles. Very frustrating and Mac forums/Apple customer service have been no help so far."
334,I cannot believe how bad this camera is on the so-called sophisticated Apple product? And no USB ports - how ridiculous  is that? So if you want to use an external mouse you can’t do that - I could go on!
335,Do not buy refurbished/ used laptops from Amazon. Often times they are stolen and when you need software upgraded or fixed the manufacturer will not touch the computer when they figure out its stolen. Amazon will not refund or replace the computer with one that is not stolen. So you are stuck with stolen goods that can not be repaired through the manufacturer
336,"Don't let the fanboys sway you, you're a beta tester with this laptop.  Lots of software doesn't function with it, I know, it didn't run of key programs I needed, also what does can be buggy at times.  If you're using this for work or real money is counting on its use DO NOT buy, simple as that.  Lots of things should have been better, the bezel in 2021 is thick.  The lack of ports is ridiculous.  If you planned to use windows, count that out.  If your a grandma using it to surf the web go for it."
337,"Just as I bought a 2nd M1 Macbook Air... The first one, which I'm currently using to make this review, randomly freezes and then automatically reboots itself after seeing a pink screen. Doing a quick search, you can find ARTICLES about this issue that isn't being fixed with software updates. This must be a hardware issue... God I hope they didn't cheap out again."
338,"Buyer beware! Like the MacBook Pro pictured here, the screen of the MacBook Air often cracks within a few weeks or months after purchase, entirely without any misuse. The design flaw seems to be the relative inflexibility of the screen's LCD panel."
339,I'm a fan of apple products and I like almost everything about this new MBA. But it has one huge flaw that nobody talks about. It's the camera hardware and it hasn't been updated in ages. My zoom calls are so grainy and bad even with decent light. A $1000 laptop with 10 year old front camera is unacceptable. Camera is very important to me. Especially now that we all are quarantined at home and making zoom calls all the time.
340,"UPDATE 12-15-2020 - After three weeks, I'm still really impressed with the M1 MacBook Air/8 Core CPU/8 Core GPU/512 SSD/8GB RAM. --- My updated plea: MAKE SURE YOU GET AS MUCH MEMORY & STORAGE AS YOU CAN AFFORD. SPECIAL ORDER ONE TO YOUR PROJECTED FUTURE NEED!"
341,I have big hands. This computer was not made for anyone who has large hands. My hands cramp constant as i type and i cannot get a bigger/better computer because of how much i have already spent. It is extremely frustrating. It is so small. I mistype constantly and have accidentally deleted many important things!!! This computer also glitches ALOT. It is constantly changing my mouse from “single click” to “double” . It constantly opens new tabs and new pages for no reason. Waste of money. Just buy a pc. I am regretful
342,"Theres a serious glitch where you can't use touch ID if drained from dead battery. Then it will ask you for a password. Unclear if this is an apple ID password or whatever, but mine didn't work. Tried every combo I knew. And then there is no option for reset password. Just none at all. And then it won't enter recovery mode. Just a horrible product, stay far away"
343,"My 2018 MBA died (logic board).  It was 2-1/2 years old.  Apple quoted $500 to repair it.  The repair came with a 90 day warranty.  They told me that if I had purchased Apple Care, it would have been covered.  If I had purchased Apple Care on all of the Apple computers I've purchased over the past 25 years I could have bought 2-3 brand new MacBook Airs.  Used to be a fan of Apple."
344,"Not much to say here that’s different from what’s been said elsewhere. Build quality on point per usual with Apple. Feels as slick as ever. No problems thus far about app compatibility with the M1 chip. As with almost all apple products, you can purchase with your eyes closed."
345,"It’s simple , clean aesthetically, and really powerful compared to older models . The m1 chip has really put this laptop on another level. Easy to carry and can handle simple and even hard tasks ."
346,"The MacBook Air M1 is a perfect gift for my mom who only uses her computer for very lightweight work and browsing. It’s just the right size for her, and light enough for her to carry around. Her previous laptop that got replaced is a 2010 MacBook Pro, and I can’t believe it’s lasted 12 years.  … but that’s Apple for you! If you take care of them, their products last you waaaay longer than any pc will."
347,"It’s simple , clean aesthetically, and really powerful compared to older models . The m1 chip has really put this laptop on another level. Easy to carry and can handle simple and even hard tasks ."
348,"I love my MacBook!! But it was delivered by a over packed uhaul and left in its side out side without knocking to let me know it was there,?to sign for it, not any safeguards in place. I am grateful for the thoughtful packing on your part because it was shipped in an oversized box and no extra packing, it moved freely within the box."
349,"I bought my first Mac in 1986 and my first 100 shares of Apple in 1992. No one could have dreamed what Apple was to become. And I never believed that I'd get a job working for Apple, and add to those shares over the next 14 years through the employee stock ownership program. Every 3 months, I get a dividend that's 4 times what I originally paid for those 100 shares, which have now become 6428 shares through reinvesting those dividends."
350,"I use this to teach online. Overall extremely satisfied. Fast, reliable and looks nice. The only two things I’m not crazy about are A) the camera isn’t really HD and B) I ordered gold and it looks more like a rose gold color."
351,Zoom calls perfect and beautiful. Video quality is excellent.  Performance is amazing.  Running Parallels and Windows 11 preview. Screen looks beautiful.  Movies look amazing.  Audio is loud and sounds spacial.  Battery lasts easily all day and sometimes two days.
352,"An apple product that doesn't break the bank but performs well. Got this gift for the girlfriend and she absolutely loves it. Screen is amazing with vivid colors. The battery life is pretty closed to advertised, lasts the whole day without fail. It also runs adobe programs pretty smoothly so that's a plus for working professionals. Would recommend to anyone needing a portable travel buddy that can put out work too"
353,I play the sims all the time on it now. I can also get my work and homework done. This is a great laptop. It costly but it's worth the money.
354,I play the sims all the time on it now. I can also get my work and homework done. This is a great laptop. It costly but it's worth the money.
355,"I bought this laptop in December 2020. I was actually debating myself between this one or a similar Windows computer, I almost went for the Windows because the processor of the MacBook Air 2019 wasn't good enough (intel core i3), but I decided to wait and two weeks later this one was launched. It's way superior than any intel core processor, I just love it. I have been using it for almost two years now and it's as good as new. The other features are just what you expect them to be: super light, portable, hi-res screen. Would buy again."
356,"If you are invested in the Mac world, you know these products just work. You don't get the spinning beachball of doom. Turn it on and voila, it does what you require of it."
357,"This laptop si so light and powerful, hard to believe is something like this on the market. With fan free technology you have no noise as well nothing hot anymore under your keyboard."
358,"This is the first time I have used a Mac product for an extended period of time. I have owned it for a couple months now and must admit I am very happy with how well it performs. My apprehension at buying a Mac product was in getting used to the OS, as it is considerably different from Windows. However it did not take long for me to get used to macOS, it was easy to learn and use, with much better organization than Windows."
359,This is my first Mac ever. I had to go through a small learning curve to get used to the OS and the keyboard layout and shortcuts. But now I am so happy with the purchase.
360,I needed to upgrade my old desk top computer and synch it with my iPhone.  Perfection.  Everything about Apple is the best and this MacBook Air is delightful.  There is so much more I can do and I can see the possibilities are endless.
361,"It's a good computer by all standards. It's pricey but you get what you pay for. Great screen and its fast. Just wish....like all electronics, that the battery lasted longer."
362,"Really like this laptop bought this as a gift for my wife to do her Masters and she loves it, very easy to use, super fast, screen quality is exceptional, Keyboard feels lovely and very affordable the M1 chip really made a difference only one thing if you can afford it try to bump up to the 512GB will worth it."
363,"Really like this laptop bought this as a gift for my wife to do her Masters and she loves it, very easy to use, super fast, screen quality is exceptional, Keyboard feels lovely and very affordable the M1 chip really made a difference only one thing if you can afford it try to bump up to the 512GB will worth it."
364,"First let's start with the overall look of the MacBook Air, it's thin, sleek and super light.  I got the gold color one and it took me a while to decide between the silver & gold. But after receiving my gold Mac, I'm so happy I went with it. The color looks so much BETTER in person, it seems to have more of a rose gold color in person but if you take a picture of it, it looks gold."
365,"it’s thin not too heavy a nice sleek look is the perfect laptop for school, really fast and overall great quality. my only complaint is the camera terrible quality but i don’t really use the camera overall a 9/10 connects to iphone and u can see ur messages"
366,"I’ve wanted a MacBook for the longest time, and Amazon surprised me having the cheapest option for buying this one! So I finally took the plunge. I’m upgrading from a very tired HP. Never having experience with MacBook before, I’m in love with it. It’s awesome how much you can personalize this little laptop. Lighting fast, too. Getting to know the touch pad and all the little features is mind boggling in the best way."
367,"This is the first Mac I have owned, I'll never go back to pc's!! very fast and super easy to use. it works with all my Apple electronics. I haven't played any games on it yet so I couldn't give it any stars yet, also it has stars for touch screen which this model doesn't have, it has the Touch ID."
368,"This laptop si so light and powerful, hard to believe is something like this on the market. With fan free technology you have no noise as well nothing hot anymore under your keyboard."
369,"This is the best laptop I have ever used. I got this product a week ago and works amazing. Highly flexible, stylish, long battery life, and better screen quality. I personally highly recommend this product. Thank you Apple products for making my life easy."
370,I love the battery life. It lasts so long that I charge it sparingly. I love the instant on feature when I lift the lid. I am impressed with the biometric scanner that allows me to log in without my password. The MacBook Air allows me to log in with my Apple Watch as well. The speed is fantastic. I am thoroughly impressed. I have an M1 Mac mini as well. I am hooked.
371,"I am nearly 60 and have never had a Mac.  A friend of mine talked me into it, and I love it.  It is not only user friendly but Apple offers ongoing expert customer support for ANY question or tech issue you have.  I am not tech savvy and these people are miracle workers, able even to straighten me out quickly every time I call.  Love the unit and love customer support both."
372,This is my first Apple Computer and I am blown away! I will never be going back to Windows computers again. It’s a Thousand little things and quite a few big things that make Apple computers just better. I wasn’t a true believer but now I am. I love this MacBook Pro! I have it hooked up to a 30 inch Apple display and it is wicked cool. And I have the Apple Magic Mouse 2 and Apple keyboard.
373,"La compré en abril, pero la comencé a usar recién en mayo 2021. A comienzos de setiembre comenzó a fallar el touchbar y ese mismo día se apagó y no volvió a encender."
374,It is sleek and works as expected. Do wish it had additional adaptor/USB ports on the right side. This only has two. My previous Mac of a similar make and size has 4.
375,I ordered this laptop a few months ago. So far it’s performing just fine with no glitches or any serious issues. It doesn’t have a touch screen but that’s ok.
376,"It’s just a great computer. Have loved my iPhone and iPad for years, but this us my first Mac. It is so easy to use, even for this “older generation” grandmother!"
377,"I was so nervous because I've never purchased a computer through Amazon. It arrived in great conditions! Battery was around 90% when turned on, great performance, great battery life as described, vibrant colors in the screen, very satisfied with this purchase!"
378,"I have 3 Macbook pros and they are all pretty old. Mac lasts!! This laptop is absolutely amazing. Its fast, sleek, and has helpful and timesaving features.  Probably one of my more favorite purchases in a long time."
379,"I had a 2019 quad core and decided the M1 was worth a shot. Wow. Not only is it fast, but the battery will last the entire day. Absolutely amazing for a full power laptop. Bye bye smartbooks !"
380,This computer is miles ahead of a windows based computer. For entertainment and work get yourself a mac today. Thanks Amazon for delivering this to my mail forwarding service when best buy and apple would not.  Buy this computer now!!!
381,"Great computer, has great battery life and is great quality. I would recommend for anyone looking for an upgrade or a first MacBook . Great for running my music recording applications and editing software."
382,I’ve never used a Mac before but I was able to learn to use this easily with the tutorials.  Very user-friendly.  When I use my husband’s PC now it seems like a dinosaur.  Love this!
383,"Computers great, looks nice as one would expect from apple BUT camera quality is horrible, very grainy. I compared it to my 2013 MacBook Air, no comparison, will be using my old laptop for zoom and FaceTime calls. For a $1,000 computer, I expect better."
384,The package was securely delivered to me even though i am in the Philippines. The item was great! Awesome difference in battery life and it is really faster than old models!
385,"The battery life on this one is much better than any of the Intel Macs. It’s snappy, can handle a much higher work load and looks beautiful - like any MacBook should!"
386,"It has been a long time since I bought a computer, but we were in desperate need of something for the entire family to be able to use. I opted for the pro with a larger hard drive just for a bit of extra storage. This laptop is fast and offers a lot of options for software."
387,"Great purchase for photographers who want something to use for editing on the go. Fast, silent, and crazy long battery life. Nothing on the market when I purchased this came close to this."
388,Glad I went with the M1 and not the Intel processor. Much faster and better battery life. SHe loves the touchbar and we're glad we got this one before Apple changes back to function buttons.
389,It's a Macbook Pro bro. What's there not to like. It's been 9yrs since my 2012 Macbook Pro purchase and I still use it. I just have to keep it plugged in because I can't find a good battery replacement for it. This M1 is much thinner. 😯 I would say half as thin as the 12 retina model.
390,I disliked the fact that I couldn’t reset and clear all my data! If it’s at all possible please perform a complete reset of the MacBook before reselling it PLEASE
391,"Excelente pantalla, duración de batería, y diseño. Lo único que no me gusta es la calidad de la webcam por debajo de equipos de esa gama y la cantidad de puertos USB C. Hasta ahora no he tenido problemas de compatibilidad con programas."
392,"I am not new to Mac, but this was my first MacBook Pro.  The speed is as fast my Mac mini M1.  The battery lasts all day even after watching a lot of videos.  The weight is perfect.  Apple make the best products."
393,"I used to never wanted to do with anything Apple related, but as I got older I needed something to help with productivity, with a bit of entertainment on the side. This Macbook fulfill every single thing I desire from a laptop from the sleek performance, fast and snappy experience, and the overall quality and feel of it. The battery life is no joke as well. I used the Macbook for almost the whole day and it was no slouch. Bottom line, get this laptop, you won't forget it and once you go Mac, you never go back."
394,"Lighter by a pound, quieter than a whisper , (if the fan runs I do not detect it),  cooler than a quartz counter top, faster by far than an analogue stop watch, it's work endurance may be longer than I wish to work and finally, more handsome, (younger looking), than earlier versions."
395,"You can read about the new features of the 2020 MacBook Pro with Apple's new M1 chip online. It is living-up to my high expectations. Out of the box, the initial start-up was flawless, downloading all my Contacts and documents from the Cloud, linking to Internet, and upgrading to MacOS 11.1."
396,"This is a very good product. Good price, and this is my first mac ever. I like this! BTW, if you have an issue with the delivery process, the seller will support you. But first, you have to check with FedEx costumer service(they can investigate for you). I promise the product is very nice!"
397,"This system is amazing. It's fast, efficient, and sleek. It was my first mac and it has officially sold me. Thanks to this system I'll be shopping Apple in the future! The battery life is outstanding!"
398,"Coming from years and years of PC, I must say that this 13"" M1 Macbook Pro is an Internet beast. I also use it for Lightroom, Photoshop, Affinity suite, Capture One, FL Studio and I have zero complaints. I hadn't had a mac since the mid 90's and I was a huge fan then, but PC's just offer so much more for the money."
399,"I haven’t bought a new laptop in years because I have upgraded my 2013 MacBook Pro. And let me say, the battery life is amazing, the rendering process for videos of photography (mainly what I used it for) is so fast, The weight of the laptop is so light, And overall just best for the buck. I would recommend this laptop for sure."
400,"This laptop is the most luxury and professional computer I have ever owned. 10/10 would recommend to anyone in school, business, or even for personal use. The typing experience on this laptop is like nothing you have ever felt. I am very pleased!"
401,"Hyper portability, ridiculously speed and responsiveness, and a VERY robust battery are some of the highlights of this little Mac. It's up and running from sleep as fast as a smartphone wakes, the trackpad + gestures make me forget I don't actually have a touchscreen here, and the M1 manages battery draw like nothing I've ever seen in a laptop."
402,Primarily used for photo editing and some light graphic design on the go with Photoshop and works flawlessly for that.  Super fast with the M1 and the battery lasts seemingly forever under normal use.  No issues with the screen cracking either after over a month of use taking it out every day.
403,"Coming from one of the worst MacBook Pro generations (2017) this was a breath of fresh air. Very snappy, quiet, cool, long battery life, FANTASTIC KEYBOARD (Those butterfly switches were a mess) Oh and the touchbar, I love that thing, didn’t think I’d use it a lot but here I am using it a lot😂 It’s an amazing laptop, the only laptop I’d ever recommend anyone get (besides the MacBook Air)"
404,Fantastic laptop for anything you need to do.  I use it for audio production and it has yet to stutter or let me down.  Great purchase even if a little costly.  Will definitely get another one.
405,Disappointed as it came with a scratch on the cover. Hope it’s really new as it didn’t say it’s reconditioned and it was the full new price. I expect better from Apple.
406,"I've been an Apple user for over 35 years, and I was pretty excited to make the M1 migration now that many apps have been updated for Apple Silicon. I expected to be blown away, and while this is an excellent Apple laptop, and the battery life does live up to the hype, I overall I found it disappointing compared to the reviews. Three things:"
407,"I often need to take conferences away from home and any source of power to charge my laptop, as a previous owner of a gaming laptop, it was a terrible situation to be in since battery wouldn't last longer than 2 hours. I decided to buy this laptop specifically for the long battery claims, and it was my best decision ever. No longer need to worry about low battery levels, M1 chip is a step up."
408,"This is the best Mac I've had so far. It's smooth it feels high quality as all Macs do, it's super fast, it you are creative this will Mac is for you, this is the first gen M1 and I'm sure the newer ones are even faster and better but this can hold its on. My last Mac it's sill going after 10 yrs and this one feels like it will last just as much.  Go with the 512mb ssd the 256mb it's too small a least for me."
409,This is my first Mac ever and it doesn’t even compare to my Asus. The speakers are very loud and the touch bar is a great addition. This is definitely a very fast and ver powerful machine
410,The Touch Bar on this Mac book makes writing so much easier. It has predictive text and know what you’re trying to say. It saves passwords by your fingerprint. If you are an Apple person like me you can unlock your max book from your Apple Watch. The battery life on this is amazing. I’m on it hours at a time and hardly ever have to charge it. Great Apple product.
411,"I made the switch from HP to Mac and I’m not impressed. I’ve never had a computer freeze on me so often, it lags and locks up. It’s not even good for watching a show, constantly kinda freezing , the words play but the video doesn’t move ... I had to buy an external USB hub to plug in as it only has 2 C type ports. I would return it if I could , but instead I will have to pretend to love it."
412,"As with all Apple products, battery life is a huge issue. The machine does perform well and is very fast. Graphics are outstanding and easy of use is excellent. Just wished it had more battery life"
413,"The new M-1 chip makes it worth the change...fastest Mac I've had, for a ""reasonable"" amount if I can make it last 10 years...only criticism is that the touchpad is to big and they jammed the fingerboard up too much for me."
414,"I've always been a fan of the smaller 12"" and 13"" macbook pros and this is the best version yet. Instant on is really cool. I use the Adobe Creative suite daily and this little laptop keeps up with everything I need to do. The battery life is ridiculously awesome."
415,"For many people this will be a great and fast notebook. If you connect devices you need to know the ports are fast but can not supply very much power. If you have software on CD/DVD, be aware that your bus powered DVD drive probably will not work. Same if you attach external storage that needs more power than a newer SSD. To fix this you need a hub / dock that is externally powered and supplies power to any device plugged into the hub."
416,"I'm using this for work for my tattoo studio, I've been an Android person my whole life but when I got this I fell in love with Apple... Now it's only Apple from here on out lol"
417,"It charges so fast! It’s very good and you never hear the fan, i've heard it once and that's it! Don't try to ruin ur laptop bc this is a very good macbook."
418,"I purchase this new computer on August 16, 2021 and it has had normal daily use. It quit working on April 27, 2022.  I don't think I will be buying another Apple computer from Amazon. I have had a number of Apple computers over the years and this one must be a lemon. I think I will get my next one at Best Buy."
419,"My intention was to download games and music. It had been years since I owned an apple product. I had forgotten that you had to use apple apps and programs. I returned it to Amazon and it was as they say, very easy and no questions asked. I will definitely shop Amazon again."
420,after 16 months the thing's screen went black. checked with apple and for $639.81 they can repair it. The computer was not dropped no liquid spilled on it and i did not even put any apps on it. I have several MacBook pro and this one is certainly not up to the quality of the others
421,Big difference between Mac and Hp. Love my Hp but hopefully I will pick up on how to use this one better soon. Just wish it came bigger at this price. I do a lot of writing and looking forward to using this.
422,"I love my new MacBook Pro!!  It’s the 13” and not too small. It’s very lightweight!  It’s so fast!  I was using an older MacBook Pro from mid 2012. It worked well, just so slow. This one flies!!  I was disappointed that there are no USB ports or CD player. I spent about $65 at Best Buy and got an adapter that works very well!!!"
423,The day I got it the computer kept crashing to a pink screen. The computer is so slow it can't even load Chrome properly and maxes out ram just searching Google. The computer gets hot all the time and the fan almost never comes on. The rubber around the screen is falling off. The Apple store says they likely won't honor the repairs because im a few days out of warranty. Just fixing the rubber alone is $400 to $500. Now I have to sell it on Amazon for $300. I will never again buy another Apple product
424,"Went with the base model M1, 256 gig HD, and 8gb ram. Snagged it on sale at $1099. This thing is amazing. Handles all my needs, and runs decentraland with no problem. 5 out of 5 stars! Would highly recommend."
425,"Lacks DVD drive: no movies whilst on the road, also, all music has to be purchased. My wealth of great music CD's not accessible. Arrived fully charged. Looks nice, just not versatile enough. Steve Jobs needed at Apple. Alas."
426,"Buggy, slow, extremely hot. Definitely the worst MacBook I've used (in 15+ years of Apple machines). I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone and will stick with Intel for as long as they're available."
427,I upgraded from a mid 2015 pro which had no light bar. This newer model the light bar is a joke and its a pain to change brightness and sound. You have to first pull up those settings before you can change them. Very Annoying! I wish I had got the MacBook Air same specs and saved a few hundred bucks as it has no light bar
428,"Oh my gosh!!! I loooove this! It works so fast! The M1 chip is amazing! it came early and is brand new! If you are worried about the few bad comments like I was, don't let it hinder you! I absolutely love my laptop for computer programming!!!"
429,I got this at a discounted price ($1121)! Cheaper than apple and same great quality. The box was a little damaged on arrival bu luckily th laptop was in prestige condition.
430,"It was a present for my son, he absolutely loves it. Fast, thin, easy to carry. He is still working on setting up, transferring etc., but so far he is enchanted with it"
431,My oldest is heading to college and needed a GOOD RELIABLE COMPUTER SO MACBOOK IT WAS. She uses it for everything real estate classes face time calls college classes etc.  Amazon thank you. It showed up early and in a discreet box.
432,"I got my new MacBook Pro M1 two weeks ago and could not be more happy with it. This machine is absolutely incredible in terms of speed, looks, weight/size, display, and battery life - and texture (it feels so good against the skin on my wrists as I type) and basically anything else you can think of. I also love the space gray color, the new keyboard, the Touch Bar, and the larger trackpad. There are so many options to customize the system to work just the way I like."
433,"Nowadays is ridiculous that a good Windows system can be as expensive as a Mac computer, or vice versa, a Mac now is as affordable as a Windows PC. This new micro, the M1 series is amazing, run fast, no lagging, and with the rest of the integrated Masc hardware I am fascinated with the performance, no matter I am just writing a book or editing videos on Premiere, or even making a complex podcast with Audition or Reaper."
434,"despite what other comments on here have said i still bought it and so far i've had it for about a month and its perfect, small and useable fast and ever since i broke my other macbook (which was a macbook air btw) i've never been happier with this new one, i love the new features it adds and it was certainly a good investment"
435,"I got this 13'' MacBook Pro to replace an older one from 2012. It's world of a difference. Very smooth, and powerful feeling. I will be using it for music production mainly, so I'm not applying many things others will seek to use it for. I love the Touch Bar, really nice feature."
436,"I finally gave up my 10 yr old MacBook and bought this 2020 Mac Book. Sooooo much easier to carry- light, easy keyboard, EXCELLENT speaker, and fast as lightening for steaming, multiple windows open, attachments to emails, and storage for music and photos. LOVE IT! I do miss a USB port larger than the lightening port, but I’ll get over it."
437,"This is my very first Mac. It was the value for the price (strange to describe an Apple product that way) and the performance of Apple's new M1 chip that finally compelled me to buy my first Mac. And I'm glad I did. This machine is awesome. It's my baby now. It's so good! Part of it no doubt is the novelty is using MacOS instead of Windows 10, but I really love my new MacBook Pro!"
438,"There are too many baffling oddball problems -- like it won't do portrait mode on a displayLink monitor.  It has problems with docking stations that ought to work just fine -- despite me turning off sleep and screen locking, when in clamshell closed mode, sometimes it won't wake up and has to be hard power-cycled or zapped to get it to boot back up.  These issues are virtually nonexistent on Intel silicon of the same era/OS revision level.  The problems with external monitors feel like they're reintroducing problems most vendors (INCLUDING APPLE) fixed over a decade ago."
439,"I was nervous buying a Macbook over Amazon, but the delivery was fast and required a signature. I have needed a new Macbook because I bought mine over five years ago. It is a nice computer and way faster than my old one. I was curious about the new M1 chip in the Macbook. It is a great purchase for the price since Macbooks last so long. Highly recommend."
440,i have owned several pc's and tablets and i always expect to be disappointed...... but nothing but excellent across the. i am an amateur when it comes to these things  this is so intuitive i am (at least i feel i am) flying through my work and my online time. THANK YOU APPLE FOR THE MOST MARVELOUS PRODUCT YET
441,"Does everything it's supposed to, no problems yet.  But as time goes on the updates won't take and we will have to buy a new one.  Unfortunately, this is not like the old school computers that you can update and make last for years to come."
442,"I’ve been a lifelong user of Windows PC and Linux. Until Big Sur and the M1 chip came out I’ve been hesitant to try Macs, so I first got my toes wet by getting an iPhone 12 earlier this year (also a long time Android user). Having used an iPhone for over 6 months now and being very pleased by its performance I felt encouraged to try one of these new MacBooks, and let me tell you, it did not let me down."
443,"i've been using the macbook for years now, but since i upgraded to the M1 version, i can feel the power increase. don't get me started on the battery life... its awesome."
444,"I really like my purchase of the MacBook Pro. It is super fast. The colors on the screen are bright & clear. I love the the 13 inch screen. It’s the perfect size for me. Since it didn’t have any usb plug ins I bought me a hub for it that has usb, hdmi, slot for memory card & it has 3.0. Love this Mac. Would recommend it."
445,My daughter is going to start college in the fall. Everyone says MacBook Pro is the way to go so we found this. The previous reviews seemed positive and it was exactly what she wanted at a good value. So far the machine is running well and she is thrilled. I am still a tad nervous because it’s reconditioned but the machine is running perfect.
446,"this is my 3rd Macbook pro.  and each time it gets better.  Much thinner than my previous one, and very light weight.  the only thing I don't like is that it only has the USB c, which doesn't allow charging of other devices.  I had to go and get the adaptor for an additional $20.  Also they don't include the extension cord anymore, which I don't mind, since I already have 2 that came with the other ones."
447,Well last eat 3 days then turned on and off by itself repeatedly like the was rermfab well piece of junk what else wast of time and money and 150 more than other sellers u think your would pay a little more to get something better also there was a stain that would not come out on eaothsr side of the face of the keyboard areas. Again most like a remanufauterrd unit that should of been sol for half ... thanks for ripping me off
448,I actually loved this except for the lack of a touch screen.  I ended up returning because of it.  The touch bar was ok but when it came to copy and pasting I had a very hard time with the mouse and there was no option to touch it.  Everything else was top of the line especially the battery life.  If they have a touch screen version I would buy it for sure.
449,Turns out many MacBook Pro 13 inch come dead from the factory to be safe buy through apple since they can immediately swap it out with a working one immediately.
450,"My new office basically is really nice. The sound quality is the best ive ever had in a laptop. So many improvements over previous models, and those were top notch."
451,"I ordered the 2020 MacBook Pro for my wife to replace a Lenovo laptop that we bought brand new in 2017 and the Lenovo starting having all kinds of issues. I’ve had 2 iMacs and my brother has used lots of MacBooks over the years so he suggested the MacBook Pro. So far, so good!!"
452,I can’t stress enough how much I love this laptop. I impulsively bought it since i’ve been using the same macbook for the last 8 years and I’m so glad i did. The difference between the old macs and these is insane.
453,"Upgraded from a 2015 Macbook Pro that has lasted me well more than 5 years in school. I expected the keyboard to be like the earlier gen macbooks; however, I was pleasantly surprised to see that they were way more raised and offered a much better tactile feedback. In addition, the battery life will easily last a day of school. The only thing I don't like about this laptop is how the M1 Chip doesn't support VM and a few other apps; but that can be changed in the future."
454,"It's a solid Apple product, and I was WAY overdue to get a laptop. I researched and considered several pre-owned models, but the cost on this MacBook Pro and the M1 chip made it a clear choice. With used/refurbished computers, there are still risks, not to mention lower battery life and physical damage. With a brand new machine, those chances are almost completely gone!"
455,"Pues la pedí desde Ecuador mediante un currier, no imagine que sería tan fácil el proceso, pero cuando llego me ha funcionado de maravilla como todos los productos de apple"
456,Had Windows based computers since day one. Always something going on with them. I’ve had at least 10 windows computers and decided it was time to try an Apple. Well I got to say I love this computer. A little bit of a learning curve but not a stumbling block. Don’t let the 13” fool you. It’s an awesome screen size and so sharp. I would recommend this computer to anyone.
457,I bought this laptop as a gift for my Grandson to use at collage. He said it's everything he needed and loves the fact that he can sync his I-Phone to it.
458,"I thought a this Mac would be the ticket for music production, but I was disappointed. It glitched more than my PC ever did. Kept wondering what was so special about it. It wasn't easier, just different. It was not at all a good experience. Returned it and have gone back to PC. I appreciated the test drive. Now I know what I DON'T want in a laptop."
459,I got it for 1130$ and I was Approved for amazon store card and bought it on monthly payment for 98$ thanks to amazon and apple products are amazing I use my MacBook for my college education it works very fine
460,I love my 2020 MacBook. I know there are mixed reviews and feelings about the Touch Bar but I actually got an old computer so I could still have the Touch Bar.
461,The new M1 chip in the MacBook pro really makes a difference when you're running multiple work heavy programs that require processing power. Not to mention the screen gets really bright and the battery is also great. I've had it now for almost 2 months and have not noticed any issues yet.
462,"I am a long-time windows user. I've had so many different windows laptops, each with their own faults. I've always despised MacBooks because of what you hear from every person who's built a pc before: ""Apple makes crappy products!!! No good to use!!!!"". Ever since I got my iPad Pro a few years back, Apple has slowly dragged me back into the ecosystem by how good their products have become. With the release of the M1 macs, I was pretty interested in how well these will perform, and eventually caved and bought this MacBook Pro."
463,"Only complaint is my computer only has 2 USB ports, of which they are specifically designed to only fit the computer charger. I can't even connect the iPhone USB to my laptop, I'd need to buy something additional in order to do that."
464,I was a bit skeptical ordering a MacBook from Amazon but it was really easy and simple. When it came I was so happy and the unboxing/setup was simple. I’ve had it for about 3/2 months so far and haven’t had a problem. Only thing is I’ve had “assistantd” pop up on my screen and it wouldn’t go away so I had to restart the laptop. But overall great for schoolwork and pretty mid with running games and FaceTime.
465,"After getting what I paid for in cheaper PCs only lasting a couple years at a time, I decided to switch to a Mac. This version with the new chip works well and was 200 dollars off when we got it. I also love the touch bar and hope they do not get rid of it permanently in future models.  The 2020 MacBooks are great deal for the top notch performance the M1 chips have."
466,"well worth the price and the battery life is nuts, I can get 2 days easily out of this in one charge with just browsing and document editing. The fans never turned on yet and the speed is incredible thanks to the m1"
467,"I honestly wholeheartedly wake up every single day and am thankful for this laptop. I use it and serotonin floods my body. Everything about it from the OS, to the quirky and cool touch bar, to the rich speakers. I adore it in its entirety and I can honestly say I treat it like my child. It is one of my most prized possessions. I am in love with this computer."
468,This is my first Macbook ever and I am loving it. Although I might have to upgrade  to a bigger screen  perhaps the 15inch would  be much better for a professional use.
469,"I've been a Windows user for years and recently upgraded to MacOS through the company I work with. After using both Operating System simultaneously for 2 years, it was time to upgrade my personal laptop. Purchasing a MacBook Pro was the best decision I made. It's a very powerful machine with great battery life. It handles all my tasks really well and no lag. 10/10 recommend to anyone looking to upgrade."
470,I went into Apple the other day & got one of the lovely estimates to fix the display of my last pro. I ended up just buying a new computer because of the price & I was a bit annoyed about it. The guy at Apple talked this computer up like crazy & I begrudgingly bought it.
471,"To start I want to give full disclosure. I didn't buy this laptop on amazon and I have the 16gb model, so my experience won't 100% match yours, as amazon only sells the 8gb model."
472,I haven’t had to purchase a MacBook since I got one back in 2015. That one finally died and this new one has not disappointed yet. It arrived as expected and is working amazingly. I love what apple has done with the Pro.
473,"Small portable and light weight. I am extremely happy about the battery life, I switched from a 7 year old lenovo windows laptop to macbook pro m1 and loving it. It's been two days of sporadic use of browsing and youtube videos and battery is still at 80%. Intuitive use of touchbar. Only thing is now I have to purchase dock to attach all the peripherals."
474,"I have had my Macbook Pro M1 (8gb, 256gb storage) for 2 or 3 months now... I can honestly say I regret purchasing this so much. It works well a lot of the time but there's too many little issues that've piled up at this point. People familiar with Mac, no need to read on. If you are used to working on a Windows machine, read this before proceeding:"
475,"I'm new to mac. This machine is amazing, my transition from windows has been easy. It's very light and the battery life is incredible, I have used it for two days at times with no charging. It' does not heat up and no fan noise or anything. Super powerful!! I'm also loving the touch bar adjusting volume and brightness has never been easier!"
476,"This is a small and awesome laptop for work or leisure! I was introduce to this laptop at work, I always work with another manufacture.  Now, I don't want to go back to the other manufacture.  I absolutely love it!"
477,"Really disappointing memory, I have the 8gb and it feels really really slow, I opened 8 sites in the Safari browser, and a few other little things and it's really slow. I constantly worry about closing some of what I opened, which really bothers me at work."
478,"I upgraded from a late-2013 MacBook to this M1, after believing all the hype about the speed of the processor, etc. The marketing for the M1 and the (probably fake) glowing early reviews made the M1 out to bee akin to the second coming of Jesus Christ himself. Wow, how wrong Apple was! The M1 is buggy and SLOOOOOW. It's slower than the 2013 laptop that I replaced it with!"
479,"Apple makes absolute trash laptops and offers no support whatsoever. I bought one in 2019 and it's already broken twice and the cost of a repair is as much as a new computer. I will NEVER buy another apple laptop as they only put out trash. My previous MacBook Pro was from 2011. That's how much the quality of these paper weights has gone down. Stay away. If I can prevent 1 person from spending this much money on literally anything else, I will be happy."
480,"When I received my new Macbook Pro 13"" with M1 chip, the inside of the white Apple laptop box, the charging cable, and the actual Macbook laptop smelled strongly of mold."
481,The screen was cracked without reason in five months. It is not covered by regular guarantees: I had to pay more than 500 dollars to Apple (and left them the cracked one) in order to buy a new one and fix the MacBook Pro M1.
482,"I got this baby on Christmas and I came from using windows laptops. It was a change and I'll tell you, I won't ever go bac to windows. I love this thing. The battery alone last days! Mine was ordered straight through apple, and it came same day. So far I've been using this thing to browse the internet and do some light work.  I use an external hard drive for photos and music cause  is a 256 and 8g. I have Microsoft office 2019 installed and its working like a charm."
483,"I have used several MacBooks over the years: MacBook 2007, 2009, MacBook pro Late 2013, MacBook Air 2017, iMac 2019, Intel MacBook Pro 2020 and the M1 MacBook Pro 2020."
484,"I dont like that the new MacBook is not compatible with many older divides such as CD or DVD players from different brands. You have to pay extra for the extension to connect through HDMI or USB etc .I wish I knew all that before I bought it. The rest is good,  just like older MacBooks."
485,"This review isn't about the product itself, but about the pricing. The MacBook Airs are great but please go to the apple store and look at their pricing for the 512gb SSD, 8gb ram, 8c GPU - 8c CPU model. On apple's website this model is $200 cheaper than what they're selling it for. They're selling the 8gb ram model for the price of the model with 16gb of ram."
486,"Great Laptop !!! Fast processor , great Retina display and great experience.  M1 chip is as fast or faster than most intel i9 chips at a fraction of the cost !!! This is my best MacBook Pro since my last MacBook Pro ... 💻💻💻"
487,"As a reference, I've used PC's since the 70's (Northstar), IBM PC products since the early 80's, and Mac products since the early 90's.  I have used the computer as a consumer, a software developer, and an electrical engineer."
488,It was a gift for my kids 17th birthday. Had been rocking with thick apple for a good minute. It has just brought them into the 22nd century... a great transition into college.
489,"I bought a 13"" MacBook Pro 16GB, 1TB directly from Apple but I wanted to leave my thoughts here in case anyone is on the fence. It is worth it. The new M1 chip is able to keep up with my workflow without breaking a sweat when all the other PCs and Macs in my office have to ramp up their fans to try to keep up. Battery life for me lasts around 10 hours of hard work when my previous Mac would have died within 3 hours. This is truly a next-generation product."
490,"For the things I needed to do for telework, the MacBook Air M1 has been amazing.  I had concerns about not have a newer gen Intel processor but after using this and seeing the battery life, I won't look back and buying more Apple products with this processor.  Highly recommend for this price point.  I can't believe how light and fast this thing is."
491,"I am still waiting on delivery of my 13"" Macbook Pro but have been running with an M1 Mac Mini (same processor). So far I am blown away (but not surprised) by the performance. For software development workloads the M1 is 2-3x faster than my 2019 Core i7 16"" Macbook Pro. A compile that takes ~6m on the MBP takes ~3 on the M1 Mac. Performance benchmarks with Open MPI are roughly 2-4x better for both latency and bandwidth. And this is before any additional optimization work."
492,"Unfortunately, this product did not even last 3 months without the battery life falling flat. The laptop will not stay on more that a few minutes without shutting down. It's especially poor when there are a number of tabs open. The laptop must be plugged up continually or it will shut down without warning. Very frustrating to pay this much for a product in such poor quality."
493,So i got this item which was not working and had the camera going crazy with green lines all around. I asked amazon  for getting a working laptop for my interview and they said we dont replace items that are electronics which is weird since my friend faced similar issue and he got a working laptop. And due to all this i had to re-schedule my interview and the company said we will be moving on with other candidates this time.
494,M1 chip does not support many software and libraries. Had a difficult time installing the required software as they are not built for this new chip. Please check what you want to use in this laptop before buying.
495,"I am extremely disappointed with this machine. I bought this specifically because it had a GPU, which I thought would be beneficial for programming with data. However, the new Apple Chip is completely unworkable. None of the modern software packages for data science are compatible with the chip, rendering the machine worthless and void for its intended purpose. I will never purchase another Apple machine."
496,It is now September. This Mac works about as well as the one I bought 10 years ago. It now has a major issue with the battery not charging. No Macbook should have this type of issue in it's first year. My last one had zero issues for 6 years. This is just a poor company selling second-rate products. Steer clear.
497,"Don't be fooled by 'USB-C'. Apple wants you to buy more of their products. There is no HDMI port, there is no USB port. There are two plug ins that are not compatible with anything useful except the charging cord. Apple does this intentionally to force you to buy more of their products."
498,"After just a few weeks of using the touch bar suddenly stopped working, then a few days later the computer stopped working and I had to factory reset. This caused even more issues as now the computer will not go into sleep mode and I have to shut down each time..."
499,"My previous review was rejected because ""It appears your review had feedback on the seller."" Guess who? So in this review I will only review the product. Unfortunately, the toggle in this computer for cust. serv. was completely defective. The OME toggle is much, much better. Be advised."
500,"Purchased as a Christmas gift for my wife. The computer started acting erratically after an upgrade. Constant freezing and buffering. Finder unavailable, unable to erase files before returning. Totally disappointed .We use only Apple products. Imac, iphones, ipads etc. Maybe this was one bad apple."
501,Couldn't get through the setup phase.  Wouldn't connect to my network.  Two other computers are connected plus a smart TV and two phones.  I know which is my network and my password.
502,I am a big fan of MacBooks. This was my fourth one in the past 10 years.  This one was a LEMON. It worked fine at first but began to freeze on booting. Called Apple three times and walked thorough reloading the IOS and erasing the entire system to reinstall. It then went black screen. Took it to the Apple store and was told in two minutes to send it back.  Tried to exchange it for another but apparently you don't have more in stock. Still a fan but sometimes you get a LEMON and are unable to make lemonade.
503,"I'm very happy with this laptop.  It's fast, battery life is great, screen is bright, and it's super light weight.  The only thing that sucked about my experience was the Amazon One Time Password.  I had to plan my day around trying to be home to receive my laptop or have my delivery delayed.  I totally recommend that people who are looking for a great laptop buy this one, but I recommend not buying it from Amazon if you can avoid it."
504,"I don’t know why is asking me to review the touch screen because the computer definetely doesn’t have touch screen. Anyway, I bought the MacBook Pro expecting to be better than my old MacBook Air and honestly it’s just not worth it. It is NOT noticeably faster and the battery lasts long but only if you’re not using a lot of programs, which in my case as a college student I always have a lot of tabs open and quite often I need to work on programming softwares."
505,"So this review isn’t about the project. It’s about the sale whether intentional or unintentional of horrendously used MacBooks. Amazon shipped a cosmetic damaged, unwiped,  not sealed properly MacBook. I did a return/replace and the second MacBook was not as bad cosmetically but had programs installed in the file system that aren’t native. Also although cosmetic damage was minor compared to the first one it was still a used MacBook at a new MacBook price. I had zero interest in writing a review but I was prompted so I did."
506,I bought my macc pro for the purpose of making music and has exceeded my expectations currently running logic pro daw but would definitely recommend getting a quality adapter unfortunately i lost my charger while moving anybody have recommendations? First time mac owner
507,If I could give this 0 stars I would. I bought this computer “new” however after using it for 2 weeks I realized that I have pictures on it of another family. This was clearly a used computer and falsely advertised as “new”. I paid way to much for a used computer. Do not purchase.
508,One day I spent over 6 hrs. on the phone with Apple. The next day I spent 5 Hrs on the phone with Apple. Don't buy Apple. NOT WORTH THE HI price!!!!!!!!!
509,Had issues with Bluetooth and other features when I received it. and was not given the option to return for exact same item. Customer service rep was rude and now I am stuck with a laptop that doesn’t work as it should
510,This product lasted a total of 6 months. The screen didn’t last long at all. A hairline fracture was quoted at $700. Do notttttt waste your money on this product
511,Battery life is amazing for all day work as an online teacher. Also able to give me some hours worth of movie watching and any other leisurely browsing after using it for an entire day. Speaker quality is great and mic picks up sounds from far.
512,"There is no fix for this, and now it can't be returned.  All that money wasted!!! There is a vertical black line on the screen.  I tried to fix it using tips from youtube videos and none of it worked.  Proceed with caution!"
513,"Apple reached its peak in laptop design in 2017 with the 13"" MacBook Pro with Function Keys.  It was sleek, slim and powerful.  It was beautifully designed inside and out.  And with its Intel processor, it could also run Windows."
514,The Macbook was defective since the day it arrived. Apple refused to give me a new laptop because it was bought on Amazon and Amazon charged us a 20% restocking fee????? for returning a product that never worked as expected!
515,"Battery life and new keyboard if nice but this mac freezes a lot. When you open more than 10 tabs, when open finder, when connecting to external monitor this m1 freezes I need to constantly force quit the applications. This Macbook ""pro"" only ""supports"" one external monitor. Not a reliable laptop."
516,"I purchased this laptop and it dropped, but not a hard drop and the screen broke. We had to replace it and did so with an original screen. It got hit again, not hard (I swear!) and it broke again. I've never had a laptop that's as fragile as this one."
517,It's a very fast computer. It really worth's the effort of buy it. The thing I didn't expect to like was the touch bar but I was wrong. The touch bar it's really fantastic this feature and it makes better the experience of using the MacBook. I almost buy the MacBook Air. But certainly it was a better decision to buy the Pro.
518,My daughter uses it for college prior to that she was able to face time her friends on the computer. Battery life is great. 13 inch just the right screen size.
519,"If you're like me and use multiple external monitors with your laptop, you should know that until Apple releases an update to their OS, you can only hook up ONE external monitor to this computer."
520,"With how expensive this computer is I’m shocked with the quality of the camera, and the fact it’s not touch screen. Those are the two only negative things I can say about this computer."
521,I bought my Mac from Apple directly not from Amazon. This thing is amazing. Battery life is awesome. Hard to believe that I can work with it all day and do not have to charge at all even with bright screen.
522,"I was impressed that there was no lagging when photo editing it.  I switched from PC to Apple which might take some adjustment.  If you’re like me,  I recommend that you watch some YouTube videos on some handy tips."
523,"This new MBP replaces my old 2011 machine. It is lighter, much faster, very quiet and the display is gorgeous! I didn’t think I would care for the Touch Bar but find myself really enjoying a feature not found on the new MacBook Air."
524,"I primarily use my MacBook Pro for music production and performance. As such, Logic Pro and myriad amp models/plugins are constantly in use on my machine. The M1 chip blows the Intel chips out of the water in terms of loading speed, battery life, and ability to handle large Logic projects with dozens of tracks, plugins, software instruments, and live recordings."
525,"Very upset with apple, specifically with the MacBook Pro. Had it for three years and all of a sudden it died on me as I was in the middle of printing something. Cost over a thousand dollars too."
526,"The hardware in this unit is pathetic and is more expensive due to the ""apple"" brand name. You are better off building your own pc and with these specs it would be LESS THAN HALF the price. Stop paying for a name"
527,"Don't believe the hype.  With 8GB (supposedly more than adequate due to new design) this is slower than 5-year old MacBook air it replaced. It is also buggy, for example the print queue does not work at all (a known bug also experienced by others).  Massively overrated."
528,"I ordered this macbook pro with an 2.3GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 and my old Lenovo passed the speed of this computer 10 fold. I don't even know why I thought it was a good idea to purchase this garbage. It's like personal heating pad, and sounds like an airplane taking off. Tiny holes on the side of the keyboard does not cut it for cooling the pc. Not worth the buy at all."
529,"This is definitely better than my HP, in which I've had for 3+ years. It runs a lot smoother and it's more portable . The camera quality is also better. I would highly recommend it to anyone that needs something new."
530,"I have had for a couple of months and I could not be happier. Apple, of course, packaged well, and who doesn't like the ceremonious unboxing from anything Apple. Blazingly fast, lightweight, and significantly improved battery life. The M1 chip was a chief reason for my purchase, after a long wait (My previous model is 4 years old - still working well!) but work from home and all the cash I saved from not ordering in lunch every day made the buy an easy decision. Happy customer."
531,"First off, let me say, I'm speaking as a tech enthusiast with a decent understanding of gizmos and gadgets. I've owned Windows PCs, a MacBook Pro 2014, and a few Chromebooks. This is, by FAR, my favorite computer that I've ever used. Period. Let me start with my favorite aspects/features, in lovely bullet points for your viewing pleasure:"
532,"Finally using this MacBook instead of my school's dusty Chromebook, I felt like I could be more successful in every way. Typing essays, taking notes, even writing emails felt like a breeze in the park! I couldn't be happier with my purchase and will never use another Chromebook again."
533,"It's a mac, what more is there to say? Not a bad deal for a one year old model. Was able to update to MacOS Monterey. Had trouble logging into the app store, but apple support was quick to fix the issue. Will update my review after I've had the laptop for longer."
534,"Started well, changed from MB 12.  However after 5 mo use there is a bunch of issues. It won't wake up without rainbow wheel for good 15 min, won't restart, etc. With very light use, daily tasks have become impossible. Memory leaks, etc. 8gb ram is always full. Latest OS. Very annoying."
535,"I don't normally write reviews, but since I spent $1500 on this MacBook Pro M1 13"" from Amazon I have been very pleased. I have had it for less than a month and so far everything seems to be in perfect working order! I really love it to be honest."
536,My old Mac Book Pro died and I finally broke down and ordered this one. Price and delivery was better than Best Buy and transfer was easy. I love it. Just bought the clear cover for it and it is great. I switched from MicroSoft 12 years ago and am a Mac believer now! Love my new Mac Book Pro.
537,This is the perfect laptop for daily use! I highly recommend the Macbook Pro 2020 with the M1 chip. The battery can last for about 10 hrs! It came new and sealed in the original apple packaging.
538,"Hablar de la Apple MacBook Pro es difícil ya que cumple todos los estándares , potente , veloz , segura , cómoda , táctil , batería súper duradera, excelente brillo y sobre todo un costo cómodo y seguro"
539,"This laptop is great all around, it charges fast,  screen brightness is great, speed, battery life, and portability. I’ve never owned a MacBook before I’ve always used windows laptops so I was a bit worried how I would adjust to it but I instantly feel in love with it! It’s really easy to use but still takes a little getting used to but nothing too major"
540,"I was extremely pleased with the faster than estimated delivery time.  The MacBook was packaged very well and was disguised, as I was concerned it would be shipped like other products in the original labeled box.  So far the set up was easy as I am not very tech friendly person.  This MacBook has been great so far"
541,"Nothing has changed, but the increase of price. The computer like most Apple products runs on the hot side, and after being fully charged it doesn't last very long. The new Ipad is worse when it comes to charging. I am an Apple user for all things so I knew what I was getting myself into. The lack of ports to connect other items to it is very disappointing. You have to spend more money on hubs. With the price being what it is at least give us back the usb, hdmi, and more thunberbolts standard."
542,"This computer is more than I expected. It’s faster than others computers I had before, and battery completely worth. Also I ran a virtual machine on it and never frozen and everything I made was completely quick. I truly fall in love with this computer and I won’t change to any other one again"
543,"I have loved this MacBook. First one I’ve owned myself as my work has always provided a Mac to use. It’s fast, the Touch ID is more useful than I thought it would be with passwords and logging into things. Overall enjoying myself."
544,"At a time when so many people are working at home, to release a new laptop that only supports one external monitor is absolutely absurd.  Everything else works fine, as you would expect with an apple product.  So I am back to using my 2019 Macbook until Apple gets their act together. VERY disappointed."
545,"I FINALLY, after years of my artist friends and colleagues using apple product (laptops, MacBooks, desktops) I decided I’d get one as I needed a new laptop since my previous one was 10 years old. At first, I was just sad for having spent so much. I thought “this better convince me otherwise”. After having this for two months, I can say I hate it."
546,"The hype: ""15-20 hours of battery life"" In Reality a fully charged battery is depleted after only 4-8 hours of web browsing which is not much different than the previous Intel Macbook 13 inch."
547,"Ordered this MacBook Pro for my business as I already had bought my first one from Costco. One from Costco is still working great, never a problem. Needed a second one for my business and thought oh Amazon has a better price than what I paid for my first one . Went ahead and ordered from Amazon… used 2x and put it away for the next 2 weeks.. Needed to start using it more and surprise, surprise,Beach ball of Death came on! No amount of restarting it fixed it.. Amazon customer service offered to help me fix it…"
548,"I've been using my M1 MBP for 4 months now with apps like Photoshop, Logic Pro, Chrome, Safari (all M1 compatible) and there are tons and tons of lag every time. Its the kind of lag that makes you think maybe I should've gotten more RAM but it doesn't seem to be memory issues. I love the battery life and not hearing the fan BUT I actually miss my 15in Intel mac. Don't upgrade yet, stick to your macbook and wait for the bugs to be worked out."
549,"Overall a great piece of hardware, if used on its own or with 1 external monitor. However, this laptop does not support more than 1 external monitor. I tried everything, including buying dongles and trying 3rd party workarounds."
550,"1- Connecting an iPhone/iPad will brick all apps that didn’t come preinstalled. I can no longer add music or audio books to my mobile device. No big deal, just cause I travel a lot why would that be an inconvenience."
551,"Coming from a 13"" MacBook Pro with the M1, this has a chunkier, clunkier form factor, but I got it for one main reason: PORTS. The M1 couldn't handle multiple screens, but this 14"" has multiple USB-C ports AND an HDMI port, which lets me hook up my two screens to it."
552,"I knew something was wrong when I opened the box and the laptop was not covered in plastic. Then when you tried to set it up, there was already someone else’s Apple ID LOCKED  into the laptop. Surprise! Totally useless. When ordered, there was no indication that it was refurbished or old. Be sure to check all information regarding your purchase before buying. If it’s not packaged correctly, send it back."
553,"I have averaged a new laptop every 18-24 months for the last 15 years. I decided, based on friends’ experiences and reviews, to invest in this MacBook Pro and am extremely satisfied. It is light years ahead of the other laptops I’ve owned. I was concerned if I’d adapt to a Mac, but it is crazy-easy and very intuitive."
554,"I absolutely love my Mac book. Everything is so seamless with the mac, watch and iPhone. Now, this company took a while to send my computer, the delivery date keep getting pushed out which was frustrating. But when it finally came it seem to be worth it."
555,"I've been a dedicated Mac user since 1994. I've owned many over the years, but for the past decade, I'd had a string of ""dud"" MacBooks. I didn't have any major issues that required repairs or anything like that, I was just consistently unimpressed and didn't love my day-to-day experience of using them."
556,"Awesome product, very fast. Only thing is bothering me is Photos curation process that is taking way too long to finish. I understand it depends on the quantity of photos but still it sucks"
557,"Tankier than last generations but is made up for with ports, performance, and mini-LED screen. Travels well when needed and has great screen real-estate for its class. If you have the money, I would definitely invest in this one or the 16in if needed."
558,"This is my first time with a MacBook laptop after been using Windows and Linux and I actually love it. M1 chip introduction last year got my attention and when I decided to buy it, this one was about to release so I just wait and have no regrets about."
559,Computer doesn’t charge and is defective. Very frustrating as it synced up with my iphone and grabbed all my data. Now repair shop is trying to reset it with only 10% battery. My first Apple computer MacPro purchase. Will return. Very disappointed.
560,"The power and battery life are much improved over my old Intel based 13"" MBP. It is a little heavier and ever so slightly boxier. Powerful enough that I considered not replacing my desktop but them the Mac Studio came out!"
561,I had to return my MacBook Pro 14 - M1 Pro because of a very abnormal sound that was produced when I would run certain applications. The sound was not produced by the speakers.
562,"Was nervous about purchasing a used macbook, but I'm glad I did. Buying used saved me $500 and amazon did a great job packaging it and cleaning it so it looked new! Awesome buy!"
563,"I have owned MacBooks for years, I went to a windows based device for a short time and sorrily missed the build quality, battery and keyboard!  I went back to the 14 with the new redesign and M1 processor.  I'm not one that needs many windows programs and really glad I went back and have the 3 year warranty with AppleCare on my device!  no worries for fragile hardware or leaking anymore!  Highly recommend."
564,"The latest processor from Apple coupled with improved retina 120 Hz display makes this machine much desirable.  The size is comfortable and not very heavy.  Battery life is really good, it can last one full day."
565,"I am writing this review focused primarily on people who are considering jumping from the 13"" MacBook Pro to the 14"" MacBook Pro, which is what I did. I moved from the 13"" MacBook Pro M1 with 16gb of RAM to the 14"" MacBook Pro M1 Pro with 16gb of RAM."
566,Honestly was worried it was way over priced but put it puts my old computer to shame. Super fast and the screen is amazing. No matter what I do fans never cut on. I use Xcode and adobe photoshop and some video editing. I can run all 3 at once with no slow downs. My Mac book air 2020 couldn’t handle video editing at all. The fans were ramped for lift off. Now I can put it to rest in closet funeral may god put him to rest.
567,"This laptop has a fun feature where it can only connect to a single monitor. You have to spend hundreds on a hub device to make it work. SO user friendly, thanks Apple!"
568,"The MacPro laptop that I received was full of idiosyncrasies compared to my previous MacPro I would be typing away and the next 3-5 letters would suddenly appear two or more words back in the paragraph. I would have my mouse poised over a choice, and suddenly the choice was made without my pressing the mouse. The whole device seems skittish, I'll try to see if it's repairable or is just a flaw in the software. My advice is BUY WITH CAUTION."
569,"Apple knocks it out of the park again. The processing speed M1 Pro, storage, long battery life and graphics are amazing. I only use it for my private practice ie. Checking emails, completing therapy notes so it's a bit overkill for my purpose, but I love it! My only regret is that I went with the 14.2in instead of the 16.2 in. That extra 2 inches makes a big difference. The 14in feels like a 13in"
570,The laptop arrived 3 days earlier than expected and was about $40 cheaper than ordering from the Apple Store. The screen is AMAZING! My only wish is that it had a USB port but they have an adapter for that.
571,I have been a MacBook Pro 13.3” user for last 12 years and used 3 different models. However found this 14” version to be most well designed and better to use. The key board is lot better. The battery life is longer; best is the MagSafe connector that was brought back; essential for house full of kids
572,"I ended up ordering two 14"" macbook pro's with AppleCare+ for my teenagers, and they don't want to use them.  Yes, the display looks nice and sound is really premium.  Even the magsafe power adapter is quite good (magnet is strong, and the link feels solid).  But these 2021 pro's are really bulky and much heavier than expected."
573,"All I can see is the ugly black notch when using this thing. What is otherwise a great laptop is ruined by this completely stupid decision to cut out a large chunk of the screen. Doesn’t even have Face ID so why?? It actually makes it seem like a smaller screen than my old 13”. It cuts off the top menu bar, it is so bizarre to use. The keyboard isn’t the best either. It’s pretty thick and chunky kind of like they went back to old design. Lose the dumb notch and it would be good."
574,"Although it’s taking me several weeks to get all the “ducks in a row” and transfer all my stuff from my 2012 iMac, this machine is phenomenal. It does things differently, but way more efficiently. I really love it. Welcome to a new decade."
575,"This new macBook Pros with the M1 Pro chips are incredible laptops.  The have a lot of performance in a slimline case.  Even at full processing they don't get superhot and barely make any noise.  My only complaint is value compared to the Intel/AMD equivalent laptops.  They are much more expensive, but what they make up for in build quality, the keyboard feel, battery life and display resolution, they are well worth the extra that you pay."
576,"This is a great laptop to use for productivity, which is why I mainly purchased it. Has a reliable reputation, bright AF screen, sturdy chassis, 16gb ram is good enough for most users so it's pretty damn fast, and just an overall well rounded computer. There are however a few things I do no like about the computer itself and macos. I come from a long line of window users and continue to prefer windows over macos."
577,This impressed me from the unboxing until now.  I mostly use this for personal research and Zoom meetings and this is proving to be a wise investment.  Buy it nice or buy it twice! This is NICE.
578,"After waiting for years for Apple to realize the touch bar was a terrible idea, that a laptop needs a working keyboard, and that the real world requires more than a single USB C port (#dongleLife), I was very pleased with the hardware specs of this new model."
579,"As a full-time software engineer, this is the greatest laptop I've ever owned or used. Battery lasts for days, compile times are mind-blowingly fast and the speakers are actually amazing. Forget all the worries about the notch and swap memory. This is the only other machine, along with an XPS 15 on Linux, that has actually blown away my high expectations and over-performed. Highly recommended if you have the money."
580,"Very easy to transfer over all the files from the MacBook Pro 15"".  Much lighter and Keyboard has a back light for the keys.  So far no problems and I have been using it for around 2 weeks."
581,"Esta laptop la utilizo para muchas tareas de nivel profesional. Me encanta la fluidez del sistema y lo rápido para trabajar. No tengo límites. Amo poder trabajar con un portátil en cualquier lugar, por su portabilidad. Tiene una pantalla perfecta, un teclado que se siente muy agradable al tacto. Es un producto que me anima e inspira a trabajar."
582,"I never write reviews, but feel compelled to write one for this Macbook Pro. I've owned macs consistently since 1990s and have dealt with eye strain on the air and now on this laptop. It gave me horrible headaches and eye strain even with a matte protector. I returned it and am now looking at PCs for the first time because if I can't read from the screen without it making me sick, I can't use it."
583,"I don't need all of the power in this chip, but trying to tech proof myself for the next 8-10 Years as software may progress enough that I might need it.  This is my 4th or 5th MacBook Pro."
584,"I haven't upgraded my computer for more than a decade, so it would stand to reason any recent releases would impress me, but this macbook pro has gone above and beyond in the small time I've had it."
585,"I received my MacBook Pro two weeks ago and am totally blow away. I had been using a 2015 15in MacBook Pro. This thing is a rocket. Long battery life, ease of and I love the Touch ID. I saved $400 with the sale price. It is all good."
586,Have never written a review but I was so excited for this computer but with the Liquid Retina I believe and even with a matte screen cover having major migraines. It’s so sad to have to return it but can’t work with the major headaches and nothing works tried all the settings and a blue light screen.
587,The 16 inch size is just right. It has a long endurance and moderate weight. It's very convenient to carry it on your back at work every day. You can charge it at night and use it all day. I like the color very much.
588,"I love my new MacBook. It’s exactly as advertised, and the original packaging is pristine. No issues what so ever. My only issue is that I wasn’t able to sign up for apple care…that might be an apple issue and not a seller issue."
589,"A  gift for my son. The first time he will be using an apple computer but I have confidence he will learn and appreciate the beauty, and quality of apple products.  Apple has been Pricy... but it is worth the price."
590,"Ok. So for the average user, like myself, this may not feel like a huge improvement but this is a MAJOR upgrade from my 2013 MacBook Pro. I hated the idea of theist gen MacBook with the touchbar. It was cool, but as far as I knew it was not the game changer apple wanted. I like the actual keys and I need my ports. I’m kind of angry that Apple took away the features people love and then charge them more when they give them back, but I guess since I needed an upgrade it’s okay."
591,"Best laptop ive ever used in my life.  Fast speed, great graphics and long battery life. What else can you ask for in a laptop.  Great for graphic design and music production."
592,"Great version of Macbook Pro, I come from the 13"" with only two USB-C ports (major failure in the design), so I really appreciate the new ports, the storage capacity, the speed, the battery but most of all I really love the Touch ID (fingerprint recognition) on the Power Button, now I can use my fingerprint to unlock MacBook Pro or to quickly lock the screen. What a practical function!"
593,"Amazing computer.  We had a mid 2012 MacBook Pro and have been waiting to upgrade.  When the 14” came out we decided to go for it.  Got the M1 Pro 10/16/16.  Incredible resolution, speed, and battery life.  So happy we waited to upgrade."
594,"I probably got a faulty laptop but the charger status doesn’t show it’s charging when plugged in, only thing indicating that it’s charging is the orange light. My chrome windows keeps crashing whenever I put the computer to sleep and the external video display rarely connects"
595,"These laptops have a lifespan of 5 years max. I would maybe even be prepared for a 3 year lifespan. The hardware is great, but apple software locks their old hardware forcing you to buy a new device. Even though your hardware would have more than enough power to run macOS."
596,"This MacBook Pro is amazing. I can do all my work without thermal issues and the performance is great. I like how it can handle video and photo editing software easy without getting hot and the fan doesn't need to come on. Can't wait for the m2 pro later this year hopefully. Apple has really add lots of power into all their product, only thing I didn't like is how buggy the software is compare to 5 years ago. I'm glad they brought back all the ports, definitely made my workflow better"
597,"I have been using Windows and Chrome books for quite awhile. I had an opportunity to get the MacBook Pro 14. I love it. I really like how the display looks, how fast it wakes up and was very easy to learn my way around very quickly."
598,"I made the switch to MAC about 20-years or so ago. Got tired of DOS and all the extra $$ programs. I do video and photo, amateur for sure, and Apple excels at this. Even makes a plod like me look somewhat good. My old Mac Book Pro is 11-years old and still going, but I thought I might treat myself. Amazing speed."
599,"For now, I didn`t buy this MacBook, but my son has watched loads of videos with it, reviews are very nice, so I`m going to order this and tell you about the first impression!"
600,"I purchased mine through the warehouse deals... I was afraid, however when I received it, it was in perfect condition! Only missing a couple of things for paperwork, but that is OK because it was a great deal."
601,"Super fast laptop with great battery life.  Lightweight with amazing screen and speakers.  Recommend a USB C hub, as many common ports are missing and it’s not convenient to carry around multiple dongles for each external device."
602,"The product is great. The Fed Ex delivery system SUCKED!!!!!! Took 4 times to deliver my product, but only because it wasn't even on the truck the first 3 times. So frustrating. Maybe switch to UPS!?"
603,"Don’t get me wrong, it’s a good laptop for doing homework and writing emails. But beyond that, I don’t see why I was stupid enough to spend this much money on a laptop... the battery life for me is eh, and don’t even try installing steam or trying any games, it stutters like crazy. Don’t buy an apple laptop, save your money and buy a cheaper laptop."
604,"I’ve owned scores of laptops and MacBooks over the years, and this is hands down the finest machine I’ve ever used. It is significantly heavier than the 2019 MacBook Pro 13 I previously had, by at least a couple lbs. That is the only downside I can think of, and this newer machine makes up for it with far superior battery life and processing power. The screen and graphics are simply breathtaking.  I look forward to using this for years."
605,"It is small, light, and fast.  Has an excellent screen.  And for such a small light computer I do like all the ports that it has.  Of course I had to get all new cables/adapters since none of the ports on my old MacBook Pro matched.  This Macbook has no USB A port, so you will need an adapter to read that stack of USB flash drives that you have, or that friends and colleagues send you.  But I do prefer the Thunderbolt 4 ports to USB."
606,"As many others have posted throughout the internet, there are some annoying bugs affecting these new macbooks and others who upgraded to Monterey OS. The tap to click feature that many loved in previous macs doesn't work well. Now there are some miss taps when using tap to click. The trackpad often requires several taps to register your click even after trying all possible trackpad configurations."
607,"Well built, beautiful, fun to use and powerful beyond my most-demanding workloads. Obviously Apple is a luxury product, so I was not expecting this to be cheap. However, if this lasts me a decade like my 2012 MacBook Pro did, it will definitely be well worth the expensive price."
608,"Love my new laptop, so much lighter and faster than my old 2012 macbook.  Even though the screen is 2 in smaller, it is easier to read because the colors are brighter and the text more clear.  Setting it up was easy, except for a conflict with my Norton antivirus which i had to remove to connect to the internet with my wifi network.  The touch pad is large and responsive, keys are easy to press, and it's very portable."
609,"The computer stops working on different apps (keys commands stop reacting properly and only give you a sound effect instead of the usual function of these keys) and you have to switch back and forth from app to app to restore the function. Computer started heating for no reason, the battery life was gone in 3 months to 3-4 hours of watching a movie instead of advertised 11 hours (which it did for about a month)."
610,"Worked great while home, I’ve been traveling and it won’t recognize my login or WiFi while I’m traveling. It’s annoying and I’ve tried all of the tips /tricks I’ve seen online to bypass initial login."
611,This macbook is assum. A bit of a challenge learning their OS after 15 years on windows but it was worth the buy.  The M1 is powerful and does heavy 4k video rendering without getting warm.  This blows away anything Intel has.  It runs Microsoft 365 so all my files are avaliable on one drive.  The video screen is assum and perfect colors.  Do yourself a favor.  Buy this you won't be dissapointed.
612,"Unbelievable - my MacBook Pro 15 2013 has a better webcam than this machine. Yes, it's 720, not 1080 but the colors and details are still more natural. Really, in a machine that is 8 years old?? I can not make any sense of it - is it because Apple installs better cameras on 15/16 inch MacBook Pros?"
613,"I spent a ton of money on this machine but it doesn't have any USB or SD ports and unfortunately every single adapter I've ever bought has been crap. The adapter will disconnect every 2 seconds even when I don't touch it making every single thing I want to do completely unworkable. I hate this Mac with every part of my being, and I have always been a Mac girl up until they took away the SD slot."
614,"The upgrade from my 2014 Macbook Pro was easy, as one expects from Apple.  The new display is noticeably brighter.  My zoom meetings look like I'm in a brighter space.  I bought a USB-C (thunderbolt 3) to USB adaptor so I could use my old Time Machine drive.  Although I moved from a 15"" display down to a 14"" display, the smaller size is no problem, perhaps because the colors are so bright."
615,"This MacBook is the absolutely perfect balance of design, battery life and sheer power. I‘ve used six MacBook Pros since 2012, and this is by far the best yet. The 14-inch form factor is PERFECT and I couldn’t ask for anything more. Worth every dollar and the best pick for students who need power (e.g. engineering students.) Downright incredible."
616,The computer runs well and looks great. It seems a bit heavier and thicker than earlier models. Speakers sound great for a laptop. I love that they brought back the magnetized charging cable too.
617,"Apple's reputation speaks for itself. Not everyone needs the power of a MacBook Pro. But, those that do will love this computer. Blazingly fast, long battery life and solid build quality."
618,"This I my second MacBook Pro but my first brand new one. It’s sleek and and light weight. I really like the fingerprint reader. The battery life is really better than I imagined, exceptional. I mostly edit photos and use word for writing. I am very happy with my purchase."
619,I've been a Windows user my whole life.  Always heard how great MacBooks were as far as their construction and performance but didn't believe the hype and figured they were just overpriced versions of the same old-same old.  I was wrong.
620,"WOW! Going from my mid-spec 2019 13"" MacBook pro to 2021 14"" BASE model is a night and day difference in performance, looks, usability with ports, and the list goes on... Geekbench shows huge gains, double in single-core, triple in multi-core, and four times higher in open CL."
621,"Product has great battery life, excellent screen with ink blacks and bright highlights, especially on HDR sources. For developers such as myself it flies through any workflow. I can’t recommend it enough, even though it’s an expensive laptop."
622,"Love my Mac, but it smells like nail polish remover. What's up with that. Hopefully, the smell goes away, but if not, I will be asking for a new one."
623,"I live abroad and had it sent to a friends house in the US while I was visiting. Brought it home in South America and during software update at first use, screen went black. Computer was still on but the screen went black several times. When cold, it works fine but after 5 minutes or so, screen starts blackening completely."
624,There is nothing to say for the MacBook. A good product. And here is Amazon. I found out after 3 days of purchase that now it costs $ 250 at a discount. What should I do? Is it important to return the one and buy again at a discount? )))
625,"To be very fair any laptop would have been a upgrade for me. Haven't purchased one since 2014. But this MacBook in the 14"" is great. Ready to use it to it's full potential. Also ready for more options of cases and sleeves to be available."
626,"The style I like very much, the screen and sound are really not to mention, the space gray is still very atmospheric, that is, if the resources are occupied more and more hot, some will reach 90 °. The whole family of Apple barrels is ready, and the escort and universal control won my heart."
627,"If you purchase this, you will be unable to purchase Apple Care and Apple will refuse to support it because it is sold AS-IS. Yes, you read that right. You are not purchasing a new product. We are definitely looking at the same product, and yes I am angry."
628,"It’s fast, beautiful display. Really good battery life. Although heavier than most laptops. It’s something I feel in love with over time. Quality is really great. The keyboard is responsive and feels comfortable."
629,"I don't like leaving bad reviews. I have used Macs since the MacPlus. I've probably owned just about every Mac made since then.This MacBook is, well, a computer. I don't see anything that is wowing me. I simply needed to upgrade to this because my previous Mac could not upgrade to the latest operating system, although it was running just fine."
630,"Clarity of the screen and improved speed were offset, for me, with a lack of a USB port, no DVD port, and still no compatibility with some apps that I would use. For me, I ended up having to buy an adapter for other devices which revealed that with the adapter plugged in I could not attach the power cord."
631,"This is an amazing machine; however, my unit appears to have a flaw. It does not charge when shut down and the case is closed.  Many people on forums have the same problem. Fortunately, Apple has been very good about addressing this problem with me."
632,"As many others have posted throughout the internet, there are some annoying bugs affecting these new macbooks and others who upgraded to Monterey OS. The tap to click feature that many loved in previous macs doesn't work well. Now there are some miss taps when using tap to click. The trackpad often requires several taps to register your click even after trying all possible trackpad configurations."
633,"Best and most powerful laptop I have ever owned. New to apple and I l absolutely love Mac OS, I love the build quality, battery life can't be beat, screen is absolutely beautiful, can't find one thing I don't like about this beast of a machine."
634,"Here are the temperature results for the new cool MacBooks compared to the old overheating intel ones. 91 degrees for the old one near the processor, and 74 degrees on the new ones. Both had been running for hours transferring files nonstop. Amazing. I have been editing video, transferring large files and not once have the fans kicked on. Makes me want to cry."
635,"I was on the fence about switching to the arm / M1 processor, but compatibility was better than expected, all but a couple of minor apps are working perfectly (on-site video editing)."
636,i made the worst consumer decision of my life waiting for the new MacBook pros (loved my 2015 one and was waiting for this version to replace - BIG MISTAKE) and as a result have been without a computer since January. They sent me a brand-new computer which was broken (after making me  wait 4 months for it) and are now unable to replace it - they said they need  at least7 months to send me a replacement for the original one which arrived broken. Migrating over to Dell. Don't waste your time - Apple is over.
637,"This year's MacBook Pro with M1 Pro/Max merges the display technology and battery life that makes iPad Pro beautiful with the form factor and keyboard of a true professional laptop, plus the outstanding Apple Silicon architecture that blows Intel PCs out of the water."
638,I have been using my MacBook Pro from 2014 for work until last week when I finally purchased this MacBook Pro. My old MacBook starts up and works as fast as the day I bought it. The only reason I bought a new MacBook was because the battery life was getting low. I probably could have just bought a new battery and it would have been fine.
639,"There’s nothing to dislike about this laptop. It’s fast, the graphics are INSANE, it runs so many applications at once flawlessly. It’s better than I had hoped for. Price was a bit scary at first but we use it for my wife’s photography business and Photoshop/Lightroom work perfectly without issue and the quality of the machine is well worth the price. Honestly considering a second one to replace my HP."
640,"I got this to replace an ancient iMac running ancient DAW software (MOTU DP7) in my home studio.  I had an eye towards being able to take it on the road with a small audio interface, while most of the time it would be the heart of my studio with a large external monitor (or two) and a small footprint on my desk.  And while I was at it, have it run Ableton Live Suite 11."
641,"We are an all Apple family, so after our 10-year old Apple Laptop gave up on us, time to get a new one. So far, not disappointing.  Has the new Apple H1 chip, which works much faster than we ever expected.  Bright screen. Best of all, wonderful Apple customer service."
642,"I already have a powerful Lenovo Legion Ryzen 8 core 32GB RAM etc... all powerful stuff. However, like any Windows laptop, fan noise is distracting and potentially disrupting especially in focus workflow. Therefore, I decided to give this M1 Pro MBP a try, and the result is fantastic."
643,I’m a developer and require heavy computing power for most of my work. Handles everything with easy. Makes me want to get into video editing while I’m at it with how powerful I see graphics can get
644,I really have no need for a laptop with this amount of power.  I should have ordered the Air with the M2 processor.  The keyboard is much improved over the 2016 Mac Pro that I used before this one.  The screen is bright and detailed.  It’s very fast and I am sure can do a lot of heavy duty video editing. But I don’t do that.  But this is as future proof as anything you can buy.  So I will keep using it until it fails.
645,"This MacBook Pro 16"" is beyond anything I expected.  The keyboard is so nice to type on.  The display is just freaking amazing with the mini-led's and promotion 120.  I have just totally been blown away.  The speed of this thing is off the chart.  Apple has truly outdone themselves.  Oh and the ports, yes ports are pack.  3 Thunderbolt 4 ports, 1 magsafe charging port, high impedance earphone jack and an HTML port for doing presentation."
646,"I have both the 14"" and the 16"". They are better than any other Mac laptop I've ever owned, and I've owned a bunch starting with the original Mac Portable."
647,"Really surprised and disappointed with how this machine interacts with and runs the current Adobe Suite. Even basic AfterEffects projects CHUG with nothing else running on the machine. Basic 15-30 second compositions with only a dozen or so key frames are sometimes taking 10+ hours to render. Totally unacceptable for a machine marked toward ""professionals"". Save yourself some money and get a refurbished older model of the iMac Pro or Mac Pro. These things just don't cut it in a professional creative environment."
648,"I love it. After several cheaper laptop computers that simply didn't get the job done and/or were too slow, I finally broke the bank and got this. I was impressed by the construction and durability. It runs quickly and smoothly and I'm able to,download and use apps with no trouble. As an author, I need an efficient computer in which to write and store my manuscripts."
649,"I got this macbook, m1 max 32 core gpu / 32 GB of ram, for work purpose and this blows my mind miles away, i never found such good a display, it is so accurate and nice to work with."
650,Got this to replace my old Mac.  Bought that one 10 years ago.  Battery life is amazing.  There are things I hate about Apple.  Calling the BACKSPACE key DELETE and not having a real DELETE key is a pixxer.  Having it hold up reliably for a decade means I will put up with their silly contrivances.
651,"My 16'"" Macbook M1 pro, 16gb ram, 512ssd 10 cpu/16 gpu,  Space Grey was purchased from a big box retailer. I wanted to review here because I feel the one star reviews are not well thought out."
652,"It was just what I wanted and more.  The battery life is exactly what was advertised.  This is not my first one.  It operates beyond what I thought.  I had one before, but was ready for a new one.  I love it’s speed and it did all the work getting it setup.  I had everything on the cloud and it was ready to put everything into place.  It works well with my external devices without any problems."
653,The computer stopped working entirely after less than 3 hours of use. We returned it and a full month later we have not gotten a refund. This is a pretty expensive purchase to just putz out after 1 day and then not get a refund on.  We're more than disappointed as we really need a new laptop but our funds are still tied up in the one that doesn't work and we don't have.
654,If you the payment plan for this and you have auto pay don’t do it. This didn’t work should have gone with Best Buy same price and geek support. No happy at all!!
655,"I love Apple products, in fact I have an “Apple House”… I’ve had the first iPhone, I had the first iPad, I had the first MacPro, I had the first Apple display, I had the first iMac, I had the first Apple TV, I had the first Apple Watch, the only thing I’ve never had was the iMac mini."
656,I'm very happy with my laptop. I'm a software engineer and I'm developing mobile apps (Android/IOS) with this laptop  and I can say that It has excellent response time :)
657,"As a videographer his laptop fits all my needs. Renders my 4k footage in no time and wastes no time in starting up. Neat, sleek and has all the ports I need."
658,"I've been working so far one month with this laptop and by far is the best one I've used. It does not make any sound (using the same kind of edition and programming apps with an intel 2019 version, which is quite noisy). It does not heat neither. The only pitfall so far I've seen is that still after 1 year of having ARM based processors, some apps still are not natively compatible and it requires Rosetta 2. It definitely worth it."
659,"First Mac and love everything about it. Still learning my way around after using PC but it’s been very user friendly, fast, connects to all my other Apple devices and clear, bright images ."
660,"I'll start by saying I LOVE the computer. I've bought MacBook pros several times in the past, and this is everything I expect and more. Gorgeous screen, quality speakers, love that there's an SD card reader and lots of ports (unlike my 2016). Also, the battery life is impressive. I can work all day on one charge!"
661,I am a photographer and I run Lightroom and photoshop and this laptop holds the crown. It is super fast! No problems at all. My internet is super slow but this thing picks up quickly. No problem with running multiple programs. LOVE this laptop. Highly recommend
662,"I've been a Mac user for many decades and have had many Apple laptops over the years and this is definitely the best to date.  Battery life is increadible, display is bright and high res, it's fast, and the keyboard is excellent.  Great design.."
663,"Where to start.  Let’s start with the startup and packaging.  It’s amazing, it’s beautiful, the box, the wrapping, the sequencing.  You open The computer it immediately turns on to welcome you.  Then you do setup, you try the new fingerprint id and you shut it off mid configuration. Not great industrial design."
664,"M1 Pro performance is mind-blowing! The laptop boots up out of sleep in a second, just as fast as you unlock your iPhone but it's a laptop. The display is absolutely gorgeous, the color is pretty accurate. The black is very deep and you can't discriminate a black produced by monitor and a natural black!!"
665,"Cannot believe how smokin' fast this MacBook Pro runs!  No problem handling multiple tasks such as McAfee in the background, Opera web browser, Face Time, and Adobe Photoshop all at the same time with zero lag!"
666,"I could have lived with the Macbook Air M2, but I really wanted the extra screen real estate for PS and Painter projects when I am not connected to an external monitor."
667,"After I was hired to host short interviews on Daily Ad Brief I used the small 13"" Mac Air my daughter gave me.  It was several years old but still worked."
668,"I’ve never owned a Mac. Let’s just say I’ll never purchase anything other system. The photoshop and quality. The tools available are amazing. I’ve already begun restoring old photos from family albums. I love the seamless connectivity of my Mac, iPhone and Apple Watch are awesome and makes my hectic life more simplified. The battery life is crazy long. I’d say over 18 hours and it didn’t die in my. My work lap too dies after 4 hours of continuous use."
669,"I just upgraded from the 2017 MacBook Pro with touch bar. It is 3x faster then my previous laptop, the battery lasts all day and after 4 weeks of using it everyday, I've only heard the fans turn on once. Which is a huge improvement because my old MacBook Pro the fans would turn after opening 2 Chrome tabs. I highly recommend this new MacBook Pro."
670,This laptop runs premiere pro and my 4k footage with no hiccups or stutters. Battery is roughly 4-5 hours while editing and performance doesn't change whether the laptop is plugged or unplugged. Perfect for editing on the go. Very happy with my purchase!
671,"Used only 30% of power after 4 hours of use in office, including web browsing, vscode coding, support an external display for a Win11 virtual machine. Finally I don’t need to bring my power source everyday when I go to office. The time I stay in office is usually 4-8 hours per day."
672,MagSafe has returned! I have been using the 2015 MacBook Pro daily for many years.  I found the keyboards from 2016-2020 completely unusable.  This MacBook Pro checks all the boxes!
673,Some product on my iPhone were not accessible on the computer which were important to me. I thought all items on my iPhone would be allowed to download on this computer. This was a hard computer to get to know.
674,"Am on my second day of having this computer. All I can say is WOW!!!!! Granted, it’s thicker than my 2016 Touch Bar one but it’s totally worth it!!!! A little spendy though."
675,This was horrible how do they give you a computer and the serial numbers don’t match so the computer don’t work. They won’t exchange the computer but they will refund it and now the computers higher not happy at all
676,I’m so mad!  This product should connect easily to another MacBook Pro.  2015 didn’t make the cut.  I’m sure the machine is the best but I can’t do it anymore.  It’s a premium product with a premium price.  It’s suppose to work and it doesn’t without changing settings.  Sales isn’t cutting it for me anymore.
677,"I was hoping to purchase Apple Care from the Apple website within the 60 days of buying (I just got my MacBook delivered today), but it turns out that when I tried purchasing Apple Care from the Apple website it just says that the device is ineligible. Really disappointed. Going to return it so I can purchase it from the Apple Website."
678,"The macbook is really a fantastic machine. The only thing really holding the mac back, is the price. Its just way too expensive for a lot of people, not even a good gift consideration because of that. You could make one of the most powerful PCs with the money it cost to buy one of these. That being said, why bother buying it? Well if you really enjoy mac os, there is one reason. I can’t think of too many though. Its a good machine, just not worth the money it costs."
679,"Bought this to replace an XPS 17 9700 (i7-10875h, 32GB RAM, 2TB SSD, RTX 2070 max-q) and while it's not a fast (probably 85% for Davinci Resolve exports, 90% for After Effects, equivalent on those games that will run on Windows or macOS like the Tomb Raider series) the battery life is significantly better. I've also never had an XPS that would just turn on when you opened it up - both the 17 and my older 13 would take a minute to wake up."
680,"I like the laptop for everything except this bug that only happens with M1 chips when exporting video. The exported video has really bad glitches and poor quality if using h264. Wish I knew this before purchasing, I wouldn’t have bought it."
681,"It needs to be about $1000 cheaper, especially if you don't get the pro max. It feels crazy to spend 3 grand on a laptop with no offboard 3d video card. However, once you get past the price, this is hands down the best laptop I've ever owned."
682,"I am in grad school and needed a laptop for zooms classes, writing papers, and low-key for playing games like the sims. This laptop was easy to set up. I was able to transfer all the data from my old mac to this new one. I also got the 16 inch screen and I don't think I could ever go back to a 13 inch screen! It so big and very easy to see the powerpoint on zoom while also taking notes on the same screen."
683,"I have never had a issue with Apple products but this locked me out within a week of using it. No apple tech could help and my information was on it. The product was picked up July 11th, 2022, and I still have not been refunded and it says they haven't received the product yet."
684,"By far the best laptop, or just computer, I’ve ever owned!  Amazing screen, sound, battery life, and blazing fast!  Even when rendering 4K videos with color corrections and graphics. I can’t even imagine what the higher end models can do!!"
685,"Absolutely outstanding computer, battery life is amazing, performance is way better than my old MacBook Pro 15” 2018. I recommend this laptop for every day use. I have installed parallels desktop for windows 11 virtual machine and it has been working perfect so far."
686,"Waited for years to replace my macbook 2014, ideally it would have had type A port but it's a minor inconvenience provided they returned magsafe. The worst thing is almost no VMs work with M1 but it's a matter of time, I hope."
687,"I am honored to be the first person to write a review for Apple. My first Macbook I’ve purchased was in 2015 and used it up until I received my new one today. And no, I am not prehistoric, I just take really good care of my things."
688,I upgraded to this MacBook Pro from a Hp Laptop from about 5 years ago and can tell you what a difference it is made in my life. I’m a student in IT and needed the ram and memory that this offers. Not to mention the speed! It is the best purchase that I have ever made.
689,"I am enjoying computing again! This machine is lightning fast with a very long lasting battery! It has handled everything I’ve thrown at it so far with flying colors-I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a laptop that works like a laptop should, fast and for a long time!"
690,"Of all the laptops I have had over the years, the Mac Air 2022 is far superior to all of them.  I wouldn’t expect anything less from Apple, a highly respected name.  The touch of the keypad is perfect.  Everything about this laptop makes it well worth the price."
691,"I am going to go about this one a little differently.  There are tons of reviews and information on the Macbook Air out there.  No point in repeating them or disputing them, after all they are someone's point of view. I am going to come at this as a window user and a skeptic."
692,The battery life is decent. I also don’t have much on it yet since it’s still new but i must say it has been holding a great charge. It also was more on the less expensive side to be brand new 2022! I’m loving it so far !
693,"Probably one of the better Apple light duty laptops owned in last couple decades. Apple laptops are expensive compared to Windows type products. The annualized life-cycle cost is higher than comparable non-Apple products, because Apple makes their expensive products vintage too quickly (seems like planned obsolescence)."
694,I pre ordered through Apple as it was not on Amazon yet. Great laptop tremendous speed for the size and very thin and light. So easy to transfer your old files from another Mac with no issues. The M2 processor really makes this thing perform. Note you want to make sure you get the right connectors for a docking station as this uses new formats recommend the M2 model versions for accessories and Amazon has plenty. Very happy with this laptop.
695,This is my first time to buy a MacBook and it did not disappoint me. I love the battery life of this laptop and it very good use for my. studies.
696,"Real to it image. Performance appears to excellent. Being a first time user , it’s not a complicated to navigate as I thought. It’s just different.  You can get use to it quickly and easily just practice."
697,"The computer is still pretty new, but she hasn't stopped using it, so I think the battery life is great, super light weight, and the value was very worth it."
698,Honestly I was scared of getting stuff from Amazon especially when it comes to apple products but ACTUALLY it came in really nice. The box didn’t came damaged or lost/stolen (which is my biggest fear lol) but yeah REALLY LOVE IT!!!!!
699,"Take everything from the M1 MacBook Air, make it lighter, slimmer, with a better camera, more screen real estate along with a magsafe charger & incredibly faster M2 chip, all in a less volume package than it's predecessor. That's the 2022 M2 MacBook Air. 5/5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
700,I purchased this base model Macbook Air M2 for attending online courses through a university. I've been mainly a Windows PC user for a while now. My last Macbook was an old 12-inch Macbook Pro G4 (remember those mini-me/Yow Ming commercials?).
701,Use it downstairs when desk top computer is one and on-half flights away in my home office.  Very valuable especially to me. I have increasing movement issues.  Deliverer actually waited for me to get to the door so he could hand it directly to me. I really appreciated it.
702,"This has to be the best of its class in the world. The M2 chip is lightning fast and altogether improved from previous generation, too. This MacBook Air can handle anything you throw at it. Very sleek, thin, and modern design language with a beautiful display. Very well built, as well. It is very durable. The whole package is amazing and good to have MagSafe charging back. Great job, Apple!"
703,well  it took them  3 days just to ship it. and they pulled the wrong color. i ordered starlight. and got silver.  i like both colors so i overlook that they got everything else right. the laptop seems fast. the screen is really pretty. i though it be brighter though ?  but ya overall my thing was the shipping.
704,"the macbook turned out to be non-working, I sent it back to the Amazon warehouse, a month has passed, but I have not received a refund, Amazon is deceiving honest Americans!"
705,It's definitely a learning curve considering all my life I've used windows. Overall I do love the lightweight and portability of the laptop and I'm glad I made the purchase it's fast and really not that bad of a price everything is experience these days
706,"This laptop is for everyday users, attending most classes, researching stuff online, watching YouTube, paying bills etc.  This laptop is not intended for hardcore gamers and ultra high quality content creators.  It is capable for learning content creation but you will outgrow this machine, that is why a MacBook Pro exists."
707,Absolutely love this computer. No issues with it at all. I think upgrading to the 512g is worth it. It’s an expensive computer only to have the base model at 256g. It’s a great every day computer!
708,Arrived faster then expected and was easy to set up which is saying a lot for me bc I’m not tech savvy at all! My son wanted a MacBook for college and now I want one too
709,"Work bought me this computer to ""work"". It's 2022 and Apple has ridden the wave of mediocrity too long. The OS is subpar, the hardware is subpar, the compatibility is subpar. The only thing this computer has going for it is the name. Hard hard pass."
710,I had an old MacBook Pro but decided to upgrade. Saw the many reviews pro and con but for what I use it for I am extremely happy with this laptop
711,"I bought this to replace my Mid 2012 Macbook Pro, which was suffering from some dismal battery life and other general struggles. I'm not an Apple Fanboy, but have to give Apple side props for making a computer that was functional for 10 years."
712,"Do not get the Midnight Blue... the fingerprint problem is worse than you could possibly imagine. Yes, even after washing your hands and using a microfiber cloth before each use."
713,"It is perfect. It is exactly what I wanted…M2 processor is faster and more reliable. As usual, I believe that Apple has the best products available. There customer service is also great. You reach techs that speak English and understand your problem. They are fantastic."
714,"Somehow this MacBook Air feels bigger than the 2020 model yet they are the exact same length and width. The screen opens very smoothly, which is a nice change from the 2020s somewhat stiff lid pull. I love how this feels in your hands. The flat surface makes it easier to grip. The black finish looks incredible. I thought it was going to be a darker gray finish but no, it’s jet black, and it looks magnificent."
715,"I bought this laptop to replace my older macbook air.  I'm shocked at how slow it is.  I never had the spinning on my other one that I have on this one.  I don't get it. I'm tempted to return it for a different macbook.  I got a macbook because I hated how slow windows is.  this is still faster than windows, but it acts like windows when you need to update it.  This macbook is up to date so I don't know why it's acting like a windows computer.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!"
716,"Ignore the bad review , that guy doesn’t have a clue , , I love it and I’m using it a lot and I recommend you to get the MacBook Air m2, has an amazing screen and its really fast"
717,"From PC Guy to MAC Guy! The jump was much easier than I thought. Thank goodness there’s a MAC version of all the software I used in the PC world. This MAC is a beast compared to the previous PC’s I’ve owned. Everything is much better. Battery Life, processor’s, compatibility with all my wireless peripherals. It’s almost too much. Plenty of room to grow. MacBook Pro 13in. M2 16gbRAM 1 TB SSD!…"
718,I use Photoshop and a few drawing apps. Amateur photography. I heard the fans the Pro comes with cool the hardware and may extend the life of the device. It doesn’t stagger when I’m running all my graphic apps and digital paintings. I like Touch Bar above the keyboard and the picture quality is nice. I look forward to having it for many years.
719,This is definitely good laptop with M2 chip it makes it even faster. The battery performance was expected to be more but it has same battery time as previous versions.
720,Surprised that it wasn’t as fast wile working with FCPX and Photoshop. We ended up returning it for a MacBook Pro M1Pro and it’s as if that one is +5x faster. As well as the option of multi displays and better specs all across the board.
721,"I'm running excel, word, google drive, meet, etc. I was worried whether I'd made the wrong decision to go to a MacBook from PC. Wow, so far I am so happy with my decision. Worth the money. It does everything and just works and is a little bit snobbish about it. From a ford to a mazerati. Wow!"
722,"A couple of weeks ago, I bought a reconditioned computer which was a nightmare, I decided to treat myself to a new computer. Im over the moon. Very happy with this computer,. Setup was a breeze. Looking forward to several years of service from this computer. Arrived early."
723,This is so god! My dell compooter came in a few years ago! The only pwoblem was was when my toodler chicked the computer out windoow and these little brats won’t give me a refund I definanty raccomond the product
724,"I used a macbook for my college years but once the screen broke I replaced it with windows. Going back to MacBook has been such a nice change, I can text from my laptop and the integration between phone and laptop is very convenient."
725,"This computer has exceeded my expectations. The workmanship is very good. There is a display board on the keyboard that can be displayed, which can control the volume and other operations. The screen of the computer is also good, and it is very smooth to use. overall feeling very satisfied."
726,"I've been using Chromebooks for the past few years and finally decided to get a Mac.  This machine does everything I need and much more.  It was worth the money.  It doesn't have a touchscreen but the touchpad does everything you need.  And it's incredibly fast.  It has so many features on it, and I've found it very easy to use and to learn."
727,"I settled on the MacBook Pro M2 over the MacBook Air M2 due to the active cooling fan and the Touch Bar.  The fan only runs if needed during intensive cpu usage.  The Air will slow the processor down to reduce the heat.  I wanted to keep performance at peak, so the fan wins.  The Touch Bar is something that I always wanted and it exceeds my expectations.  I've used it more often than I thought I would."
728,"I use this MacBook Pro M2 for music creation and it really surprised me with how much faster and responsive it is compared to my 2017 Intel based MBP. The single external monitor support kind of surprised me but it gave me a good excuse to get a nice LG 4K Ultrafine 32"" monitor. Really loving this setup!"
729,"Bear in mind that for the 256GB version, your read/write speeds are going to be half of what they were on the 2021 M1 model. The 512GB 2022 M2 version is unaffected. Just FYI"
730,I absolutely love this laptop. Switching from a PC took a little adjustment but I’ve had an iPhone for years and love the seamless integration between the 2. I could use a bit of a larger screen but I understand that’s not the way the market is trending. And I’m still comfortable with it as it is. A truly great product for sure!!
731,"Plenty of speed and power for photo and video editing using Adobe software. My biggest complaint is that the machine has only two ports. If you are charging the machine in one port, you are left with a single port."
732,I am not sure if Amazon will allow me to write a review for this new Apple MacBook Pro 2 ... as I chose to NOT buy it after checking it out.  I am hoping that somebody at Apple might see these comments from a current Mac owner.
733,"Full disclosure: This is not my daily device. IT purchased one of these at work because they couldn't wait on the M2 MacBook Air, but now they wish they had."
734,"I purchased MacBook Pro in the year 2017.  The camera is useless and not working.  When I took the device to Apple store, the estimate for repairs is given as $578 for replacement of entire display."
735,"Be sure to by expensive adapters, and special Apple mouse, in order to use it.  I tried to run my favorite photo app, and the app only partially worked.  I received warnings that the app was using too much memory, and I should shut it down.  I returned it."
736,"I have several versions of the MacBook Pro, and this one is very fast and the picture and colors are awesome! It has a longer battery life than before and a user-friendly touch screen.  Amazing!"
737,4 th MacBook I have purchased for my college age kids! This computer is fantastic for nursing students and business major students. My daughter is extremely happy with everything about this computer!
738,Do not buy this laptop thinking that it was ever $999! The real price is only around $400 DO NOT believe the sale price. It is a decent laptop spec wise for $400 and nothing more.
739,"First time Lenovo owner, is fast, good for everyday office and social media use. I would like it more if it came have with a USB-C, and a connector for adding a 2.5"" Hard drive. But you can buy one online for about $11 and add your Hard drive from your old laptop for more storage to complete a better. Nice style and light weight, is fast enough, Screen not bright for outside usage, i guess is because is a touch screen?. Key pad is very good but not back light"
740,"I read reviews before buying this laptop and I was hesitant. I bought it and I must say, it was worth it. Touch screen works perfectly. It's fast, quiet, and light weight. It has very good battery life even while multitasking. Came with all specs advertised. Very good quality product. Happy with this purchase."
741,This is my first laptop and I absolutely love it!! I'm used to using my desktop PC.  I'm glad I finally picked one! It's slick and lightweight has all the features I need for college courses and the battery life is great! I love the color.
742,Really well done machine for the money. Overall a good investment if you are going to use it for light duty tasks. Screen is below average and so is the trackpad. I recommend it.
743,"This was purchased as a gift and Windows 11 was supposed to be on it, which was a deciding factor on which computer to get. It came with Windows 10 home. Very misleading."
744,"La función, rapidez, pantalla está bien por lo que se paga. Sin embargo la batería dura a lo mucho 1 hora cuando se usa sin conectar, inútil si se va a usar en un viaje o en un lugar donde no puede estar conectada."
745,"I waited a while before writing a review, but now that I have all of my software installed and I’ve used it for a while, I’m impressed. With dozens of browser tabs opened, several office applications opened, and watching Netflix at the same time, this laptop refuses to choke. Additionally it does not hesitate when coming out of sleep or restarting the laptop."
746,This laptop does everything I need it to. Nothing fancy but works good. The one thing I wish was better was the screen quality. Images and documents are a little dull but not bad enough for me to return it. And the keyboard does not light up but that’s ok.
747,Since receiving on July 12 I have had no issues with laptop. Wasn't hard to set up and speed is impressive. Took a chance on brand and happily surprised with item. Great screen quality and first touch screen so getting used to it but works fine for old timer like me.
748,"I have had a couple Lenovo laptops over the years, and wouldn't continue buying them if they werent great... BUT they have HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE battery life. I keep mine tethered most all the time, but its amazing how quickly the battery will go, AND it can go from telling you you have 35% battery life left, to suddenly shutting down because of no power. No further warning. Nothing. its poof, and its out of battery again."
749,Had it for less than a month and the screen developed issues. Had to return it. But the customer service was great and I had my refund in no time.
750,"It is a flimsy piece of junk. It would not stay on. When returning, the screen cracked during the delivery process. Seller tried to screw me with a 50% restocking fee. Stay away from this product."
751,"I really like the laptop and love the touchscreen. However, Windows 10 was on the laptop, not Windows 11. I had a really bad experience before installing Windows so I did not want to install Windows 11. Why this seller posts Windows 11 I don't understand, Windows 10 should be stated. I returned the laptop, and the seller processed a full refund in seven days."
752,"The Amazon Fulfillment center intentionally shipped the wrong product and proceeded to charge me for the laptop I actually ordered.  The shipped laptop was an unacceptable, poor performing replacement and looked like a previously returned item that was restocked."
753,"El equipo me pareció excelente por el precio, pero mi opinión cambio cuando me fije que solamente la batería dura menos de 3 horas. ¿En verdad señores? 3 horas en pleno 2022. En la publicidad indica que la batería dura aproximadamente 7 horas.  Y ojo, que solo lo puse a funcionar con Youtube para no exigir un trabajo más pesado, y fueron solo 3 horas.  No me imagino que sucedería cuando haga un trabajo realmente pesado o quiera jugar un videojuego.  Se necesitan respuestas por favor…"
754,"Despite all battery saving attempts, this thing leaves me worried to go anywhere that I cant plug in. And, this day and age, needing to carry the stupid cord around is Ludacris. ZERO complaints otherwise; great little device. I also own a Lenovo thinkpad, which has USB-C charging; meaning i can take a power bank or other to charge on the go... This.. nope. I should have went for another chromebook, i think."
755,Product description was incorrect. Does not have windows 11 it has windows 10 s mode. Also the RAM was wrong said 20 but then it only provides 8. Fix your description because this was a bait and switch and should be sued for false advertisement.
756,Bought thus fir my son to replace his broken laptop. He really liked the touch screen  and how nice the laptop was! Definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to purchase a new laptop!!
757,Read some reviews about it coming with windows 10 instead of 11 sadly this was not the case I’m not stuck on windows 11 probably gonna return it or wipe it and download windows 10 overall nothing wrong with the product
758,They made it look like you’re getting a high quality laptop for a low discounted price. The fan is loud and the screen quality is poor. It also came with windows 10. Probably worth les than what I paid for it.
759,It was a decent computer but wasn't what I needed for my business. The screen is not as clear as I would like. And the battery life was not long enough for me. I needed a battery that would last a little longer
760,"I grabbed this for 50 percent off. It's hardly even worth that. If you're just a casual user you might be satisfied, but the video quality is very washed out and the whole device is below the quality of any solid-state drive laptop you could be buying for $1000. If it was worth what is claimed, they wouldn't have taken 50 percent off for a non-holiday sale."
761,Estoy muy contenta por haber adquirido este laptop y haber hecho negocio con este vendedor.  El artículo me llegó como lo describió en el anuncio y la entrega fue puntual.
762,"not sure if I'll be returning this computer, sounded like a really good computer and a very good deal during Prime Week. BUT if came with windows 10, not windows 11 as it was advertised. came with instructions, how to upgrade to windows 11. So far i have spent 3 hrs. trying to upgrade following the instructions, that came with computer. tomorrow i will have my computer guy try. Right now i am very unhappy knowing that i have to pay someone to load something that was supposed to already be loaded on the computer."
763,This laptop comes stripped down and very basic no frills. The screen quality is good enough but the battery life is terrible. Expect about 2 to 2 1/2 hours with normal usage. The battery also drains down even when the machine is turned off. Shutting it down overnight and turning it back on in the morning expect the battery to drain about 50 to 60 percent. The keyboard is not backlit and can not connect another monitor.
764,"This is not a $959 computer marked down, this is a very inexpensive laptop and I am not sure whether it is even worth the $400 I paid for it.  Don't get me wrong, I am a huge Lenovo fan, but this was not a good purchase.  It appears to have been reconditioned."
765,"For the price it has an amazing amount of features.  The keyboard is really nice, as are all the other features.  I basically use it like a tablet so I am not worried about it being able to run a bunch of complex business software.  It handles my requests extremely well.  And it is really light and very classy looking!"
766,The battery is TERRIBLE! It lasts less than 24 hours. The other thing is when I turn it off and close it and come back to use it the thing is already on. I don't like this computer and most importantly the BATTERY IS TERRIBLE!
767,"Pros:  Very lightweight, screen is bright, Cons:  Way too much Microsoft control over so many features.  Touch screen is way too sensitive- will check to see if can be adjusted.  The key pad is frustrating with “areas” rather than keys.  Works okay with mouse but defeats purpose of laptop which I like to use on my lap.  I would reconsider purchasing this model in the future."
768,"Product not as advertised. Description specifically states “Windows 11”. Arrived with Windows 10s, no mention of Windows 11 or easy way to update to Windows 11. Also shipped in large box with minimal padding (1 strip of packing paper).  Returned for refund (with additional packing material and reinforced box). Amazon should really remove the listing for this item."
769,"Thie product description clearly shows that Windows 11 will be installed on the unit, but it was delivered with Windows 10s.  I have returned this unit and requested a replacement.  When the replacement arrived, it also had windows 10s instead of Win11.  Starting my second return process.  Will not be reordering."
770,"Couple things, first, the edges are sharp and scrape my wrists when typing,. Second, the battery life is very poor, maybe 3 hrs untethered. Third the screen is kinda dull compared to other similar brands. Yes, this does come with Win 10 but it immediately updated to Win 11...wish I would have stuck with Win 10!"
771,If you need a laptop to do light work on this computer works fine.  It has Microsoft Edge 11 which is in your face constantly. There are many You Tube videos that explain how to work around Edge 11.  The clarity and color are poor and the type is a grey color rather than black.  If you have great vision this won't be a bother but the quality is quite bad if you don't.  It's a cheap computer so just realize you get what you pay for.
772,"I really like this laptop for the price. I LOVE the touch screen ability! Only negative is the battery life. After 4 hours of use, the battery shows low. I was expecting a much longer life."
773,"Bought this for my son to use for his academics and it is a solid machine. No hang-ups, quite fast, smooth action, crystal clear screen resolution ... this machine is good! I will be ordering this for the persons in my office for field and desk use ... we've struck gold with this machine!"
774,"Mouse Pad did not work and touch screen was not working very well.  Talked with Lenovo tect but was unable to correct problems.  Was advised to return to Amazon.  Returned by UPS, waiting for refund."
775,We are very satisfied with this computer.  It has been several years since we purchased a lap top.  So far--this has been very good to work with.  It is so much faster.  This brand came highly recommended by someone in the tech.
776,"I love this thing! So happy to have an updated version of my favorite design. I use my Chromebooks constantly and over the years (due to Google discontinuing updates...) I've bought about 10 total, a few as gifts. I've used basic ones, large screens, and flip/touchscreen versions, but this is by far my favorite."
777,Got this for a trip that required a few connecting flights. I wanted something with a long battery life and was small. This chrome book is thicker than I expected but is still pretty lightweight. The battery life is amazing. Like ten hours. It also charges really fast. So far I’m happy with my purchase.
778,"I like the size, but when typing the keys are more than slow. I have to stop and wait for what I've typed to catch up. Then have to go back because it seems like it misses some of the letters typed here and there."
779,Purchased this for my 6th grader. Worked great until it just stopped working one day in the middle of class. Screen went blank and that was it. She maybe got two months at most out of the purchase.
780,I bought this the other day. All I wanted it for was to watch videos online. The screen constantly goes black and comes back a couple of seconds later. I thought this was a great prime day deal but the product is very disappointing.
781,This is the second one we have purchased. Works great until the protection gets out of date and then you can’t use it to purchase items and have to buy a new one every few years.
782,"Honestly no a bad computer. I have been using this for sometime now. However I will say I dont like the mouse touch pad, the on off accidently gets touched your typing will be crazy for a moment. Also the more i use this computer they more often it seems to happen. Its becoming a bit more sensitive. It is just something that you need to be aware of."
783,"Al principio funciona de maravillas, luego el Windows empieza a fallar, Amazon no da una solución afectiva y si por algún evento decides quedarte con el pc para arreglar lo por tu cuenta solo te reconocen 10.00 de bonificación"
784,"This is a good little laptop, your perception of it depends on what you're buying it for.  Do you need something for social media?  It's fab!  Gaming? No way!  Videos? Nope... the speakers are horrible, even at 100% it's near impossible to hear.  I bought this laptop for one purpose, to use with my Cricut.I had to take it out of S Mode in order to install the Cricut program which immediately activated McAfee protection that will eventually be a subscription."
785,"I was very disappointed with this item, it was so extremely slow I had to return it after 2 days. Just hitting the start button and pulling up something as simple as the paint program took this computer a full minute to load.  Really not worth your time, I bought this as a gift for my dad who has the worlds oldest laptop yet that still ran faster than this.."
786,"This is a great little machine, provided you have realistic expectations. I bought it when it was on sale for $200 in Feb 2021, and while I certainly feel like I got more than I paid for, it's never going to be a high-spec gaming rig or workstation -- it has 4GB of RAM and a dual-core CPU. For coding, writing, or web-browsing, though, it's great! I installed Ubuntu MATE on it (easy if you use the opt-in Realtek drivers) and use it primarily for writing code (Python, C, and C++, mostly)."
787,Smooth clean and amazing customer support. Offered a full refund for a minor damage! The laptop is smooth and can do everything. If you’re looking for a good price laptop this is amazing. I even played GeForce fortnite and I played roblox etc and it ran smooth. Smooth is just the word. Best laptop I’ve bought for cheap!
788,This thing is the same exact size as my kindle! I opened the box and laughed - I’ve had a chrome book this same size and it wasn’t this small. It’s probably only 10” and the screen is roughly 8.5” long. Returned!
789,"I love everything about this computer. I ordered it cause I was starting my first year of College. It came With Microsoft Office 365 (For Free) No gimmicks or trials) which in itself is a value worth over 100.00 or more. So if your thinking of purchasing this computer, DO NOT Hesitate... Buy It! It's worth Every Penny."
790,"I regret this purchase. It is quite honestly the buggiest laptop that I have ever owned. Shuts down randomly, freezes etc. I've had it for less than 6 months and only use for work, school andstreaming  tv.  Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."
791,"Keyboard didn't work, couldn't even set it up, tried to contact customer service, told it was down for two weeks, found the question on FAQ, it was pretty worrisome that this is a frequent problem, the fact that there were several solutions that were way beyond my technical abilities was also an issue, but the biggest issue was that the computer had to be set up for me to complete any of them"
792,"This laptop could be considered good for its price, but it is so slow, it becomes impossible to work on it and by work I mean just browsing on websites and creating PDF and Word files. Nothing crazy. I think this laptop is only good to watch movies, but even for that, the screen is not the best quality."
793,"Great for the poker I play.  Can't speak on gaming as I haven't been a nerd since Skyrim.  The only con is the brightness doesn't get as loud as I would like,  but for $200 I'll squint.  Lightweight so I can one hand it while doing other household chores.  Good stuff Asus, keep it up."
794,"I like the value of the laptop. My only regret is not to have chosen something with more memory. Every time I have a Zoom meeting, it tells me to close all other applications and everything slows down. I can’t complain about the price though."
795,I needed a simple computer to help tune my car. This was perfect. It's lightweight. Easy to handle. The back lighting is a very nice touch. It processes commands smoothly and quickly. The screen is bright and clear. I have ZERO to complain about.
796,The laptop checked off all boxes the wife needed to do her volunteer work and so far she has not made me attempt to fix anything which means its not broken.  Enjoying the silence.  Thanks ASUS
797,"This is a great basic laptop. If you want something just to do a little web browsing, maybe some light work, this is for you. If you like doing some light reading and web browsing at night or in a dark room, this is for you."
798,"I knew I was not getting speed with the price I paid, but the quality of the screen is just OK, and the touchpad is a bit too sensitive, but overall it suits my purpose of a portable note taking machine."
799,I haven't had the laptop a month and the keys are malfunction. It can be working fine the the letter v starts doing this vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv the same with the space bar. If u connect an external mouse the keypad doesn't work
800,"This computer totally died after four months of light use. Since it was selected as an ""amazon choice"" I am very disappointed. I really liked this computer and ease of use, and it is sad it broke so early after only light use. I've had my iMac for 10 years and it works great. SO I have high expectations."
801,"CPU not fast enough to use for remote classroom use -Google Meet & Google Slides simultaneously. Good lightweight windows laptop for browsing, mail, watching videos etc but not processor intensive work"
802,"I bought an 11.6"" Asus back in 2015. Yes it got a slow at a certain point but it maintained! This time round decided for a bit of a bigger screen and happy I made that choice. I've had this 14"" notebook now for 4 days and so far it's exactly what I wanted...same as my one before just a bigger screen. And of course way faster since it's new! Highly recommend. Definitely sticking to Asus when the time comes again to buy another notebook!"
803,"I’m judging it to harshly, I came from a MacBook. I gave my MacBook to my mom and for the time being I wanted a cheap laptop that I could use until I bought myself another laptop. After using it for an hour, I realized this wasn’t for me and I returned it the next day. I recommend this for maybe grandparents or very young kids at school or maybe someone who doesn’t have a computer and just uses the laptop to keep files and pay some bills."
804,When I purchase this laptop I wasn’t told it was refurbished. Now when I got it. Two weeks after the screen starts glitching. Don’t waste your money. Amazon won’t give me back my money .
805,With every setting turned down besides screen quality this laptop can push 32 chunks 40 FPS however with good internet it can achieve 60 FPS this appears to only happen in the nether though. Frame quality in the end is the same as the over world. Online gameplay seems to somehow run smoother than single player so remember that.
806,"Realmente es una portátil maravillosa para trabajar, usar programas de Office, internet, ver películas, escuchar música. Es muy delgada y liviana. Me compré la de 14' y el teclado tiene retroiluminación, la calidad de la pantalla es muy buena, y en su primer uso estuve trabajando en ella 5 horas y aún tenía el 50% de batería. Estoy muy contento con sus prestaciones y la calidad en general."
807,"This laptop has been an experience well worth the price. It runs all my games at max graphics with 120+ fps with beautiful quality and responsiveness. The form factor is sleek and compact, and I can enjoy gaming anywhere with it. It does get a little hot, but the laptop’s thermal management system is more than sufficient and I’ve had no problems with overheating. Overall I’d recommend this to anyone in the market for a high end gaming laptop."
808,The laptop looks great physically. It had so many software problems. All rgb lights keeps turning on from Sleep in the middle of the night lighting up my whole room like a Christmas tree. Any software updates throws off how my Occulus VR works. It just stops working! All dark screen!
809,"This laptop is incredible with DDR5, i9, and a 3070ti and played every game I could throw at it. BUT the power adapter died after I had the laptop for only 6 days, so Amazon refunded me $200 to purchase a new power adapter instead of returning the entire computer. Tons of hassle for a part failure on a brand new computer. I will update this review as this unfortunate situation progresses."
810,"This laptop is a beast. On Turbo it is loud, but on performance it's quiet even if being pushed relatively hard. and if Asus Armoury Crate to be believed, the heat is fine. It is also CERTAINLY not hot. Compared to some real furnaces that would burn my hand I've had in the past, this is nothing."
811,"Coming from a desktop rig I built in 2019 (ryzen 7 3700x, rtx 2070 super, 32gb ram) this thing annihilates it in gaming. Some initial thoughts after playing with it for a few hours tonight:"
812,The laptop is an absolute beast! i9 CPU doesn't break a sweat on multiple tasks. GPU is amazing. 300hz screen is beautiful. Added a 2TB NVME for games. This ROG is built for years of use.
813,"This laptop gets hot quick when gaming, even after I bought a cooling pad, even had to get a new keyboard because playing on a hot keyboard got old quick, wish it had more fans and wish the fans were more powerful, other than that tho this laptop is pretty good, would recommend upgrading ram for it, slapped in some 32 gbs for this thing and works great now, good purchase over all"
814,"Upgraded from an ASUS from 2016, and I can’t be any happier with my purchase! Computer runs absolutely flawlessly! I tested on Apex Legends (The main game I play) - 300fps on ultra graphics without even so much as a hiccup! Tested there after on some other games (Elder Scrolls Online, New world, Guild Wars 2, Overwatch and CoD - Warzone) all running absolutely perfect!"
815,"This is a beauty! I'm an architect and Even I have not order the model with the highest specs, this baby is a monster!!! 😎 really loved every single part of it. This does not have an integrated web cam. It does not have camera. Which I loved lol"
816,"I love this computer and had the best time playing Star Wars, Battle Front II. The only downside is having to use an external camera. With having to use an external camera, I have trouble using my bluetooth microphone for conference calls/or skype/etc."
817,This is the best laptop I have ever owned and the most expensive one as well. I loved that I can upgrade the laptop memory. The cool feature I found was that I can unlock the keystone as another hard drive memory. Asus always have the coolest technology when it comes to their product. RGB lighting is a plus. Overall I would recommend buying one for gaming.
818,"Super fast machine.  Does not have a webcam, but that is actually perfect for my use.  More USB ports would be ideal.  Fans can be very noisy, and even the keyboard can start to get hot when it gets really going.  I am using a KLIM cooling stand, which helps a lot."
819,"After 5 months the laptop keyboard lights up, but no screen or boot attempt. Just hear fans cycling and the keyboard is just red. Id expect a laptop like this to last a few years before having problems. Never moved from my desk since opening it. Vastly disappointed."
820,"This computer is an absolute steal. I spent another $100 to add a second hard drive, but for the price of this computer with an 12th gen i9 and a RTX 3060, I don’t mind one bit. I’m able to run all of music production software and vst’s without noticeable latency. And it still can run games like COD Warzone and Rainbow Siege without a sweat."
821,Just incredible. the feeling to the touch is just pleasant. I feel like typing on the keyboard all the time. The only downside is the lack of a built-in camera. But I stay Asus.
822,"the laptop is powerfull but the 1080 screen is awful IMO ,  for the same price you can get the m16 asus rog with same exact specs but with a better screen,slimmer ,lighter and with a facecam..."
823,Pushed the power button for the first time and was  greeted with pretty keyboard lights and a black screen. Laptop display never powered up. Sending back for a refund. Would not recommend as it is either not packaged properly or having some kind of factory hardware issues.
824,"First and foremost- we mainly use Macs/Apple but a few of our family members game frequently (which is definitely not something Apple's are known for being any good at) and my husband is an Android/Windows developer, so we have several Windows machines around, including one he built specifically for gaming last year. So while I'm an Apple expert of sorts, Windows boxes are still a bit foreign to me."
825,"Not sure what happened but everything is great but my touch pad bottom right corner is sticking up, I just had this laptop for a week, I’m thinking sending it back for a replacement. Anyone has this problem. Thanks"
826,Laptop was quite expensive (2049USD) but I don't regret it. I bought an older alienware on clearance for 1400 and just thought I wasn't getting engine bang for the buck.
827,"I liked it except for the fact that it was not 1440 resolution. I play games at 4k with Dolby Vision at times. Dropping down to 1080 with Dolby Vision I just couldn't do. Especially since I thought I was getting 1440 which is basically 2k. I could have dealt with that. Everything else was great. Unfortunately, I had to return it for that reason."
828,"Perfect gaming laptop, it runs all games perfectly. However, there is an issue in the touchpad some times it stuck and doesn’t work at all, you gonna use mouse for a short time and then it will works just fine."
829,"I've thrown alot at it in terms of games: Cyberpunk, Red Dead Redemption 2, Halo Infinite, Metro Exodus, The witcher 3, Monster hunter world... and alot more, everything on ultra settings with ray tracing in the games that alow it, and its smooth as butter ALL of the time. Great heat control, my unit never goes above 75 degrees in high loads (I do have a thermaltake massive cooling pad, and use my laptop in a very cold environment). Haven't seen one game so far that this computer can't run smoothly. 10/10 Machine."
830,It's an awesome gaming laptop.I chose the lowest one RTX 3060 yet it plays Elden Ring on max setting without even straining one bit.Only down side is the weight but then again it's manageable.It doesn't have a camera  but that doesn't bother me.All in all this is an awesome machine which can handle any Demanding game that exist for a reasonable price.Go for it. 👍
831,"This is an OP laptop, excellent for gaming almost any new game, playing fps games is really smooth with that 300hz screen, when working at top speed fans there are not as loud as I expected and you can easily control every aspect of performance, the mux switch is an excellent addition, the only con is that doesn't come with a camera but overall its a must have laptop if you are looking for better performance, with that 12gen Intel chip things fly!"
832,"Can easily play any game on ultra settings you throw at it and it really isn’t that loud when you’re playing. Only thing is that it eats up battery but since most people are going to use this laptop to game, it’s only customary to keep it plugged in. Although it does have that portability option. For 2k, I’d say if you’re looking to buy this machine go for it. The build quality, aesthetics, and performance are astounding. 11/10"
833,"First, I'll just tell you that, yes, this computer is incredibly awesome.  Then I'm going to nitpick it as much as I can just to give you an honest perspective and hopefully some details you haven't already figured out."
834,I really am enjoying this laptop so far. The high power limited 3070ti plays all the games I enjoy at 100-140 fps and the screen looks quite good. The speakers are the best I've heard on a gaming laptop so far (although i wish they could be a bit louder.) I upgraded mine from 16 gigs of ram to 32 and the process was pretty close to simple- since there are two ribbon cables connecting to the LED light bar you should be careful of.
835,"This laptop is amazing. I've had it for only a week since writing this, but I am not disappointed. Getting 16gb of ram for well optimized games should suffice, but it would be better to aim for 32/64gb. I ended up upgrading to 32gb and am very happy."
836,"They are purposefully misleading customers this is a production model that is advertised as having 300hz screen with 1440p and 16 gb of ddr5 ram but it's really 1080p 300hz the system is supposed to be 1440p display at 300 hz and 32gb of ddr5...DO NOT BUY THIS UNLESS ITS PRICE IS REDUCED BY $300 ATLEAST....THIS IS FALSE ADVERTISING TO GIVE A 1080P PAL 300HZ DISPLAY WHILE CALING IT 1440P 300HZ, ""JUST BAD BUISNESS""..."
837,"Worked great at first, then it stopped working suddenly after a month of use. Since it’s been a month, I can’t return the laptop so now I’m stuck with a useless non-working computer."
838,"I needed a laptop to plug into my worksation (in which I also game at ultra wide 1440p)  and after comparing laptops for weeks I found that this one has the best performace to price relation (I bought it for $2,049~)."
839,"Less than 6 months of buying the laptop the trackpad stopped working, after sending the laptop for repair the display started showing white spots so sending it again for service. As the return window has closed I cannot return/replace the laptop so ended up being forced to buy a warranty extension as I wanted to ensure that I do not want to pay for a new laptop's repairs out of pocket. I would not recommend buying this laptop."
840,"I bought this pc this week and it unnecessary gets really hot and the screen has glitching issues. For an expensive laptop as this, there is a serious lack of quality control by Asus."
841,"This is a really good laptop. Every game that I have thrown at it runs smoothly. It handles other tasks, outside of gaming, really well. The touchpad has its issues. There is a delay in the movement of the cursor and at times the touchpad just stops working. Both are frustrating especially in situations where I don't have my mouse. I'd expect issues like this to not happen on a $2000 computer. Other than the touchpad this computer is solid."
842,"I gave it a 4 out 5 rating because of price and battery life while gaming. If you plan on gaming, which it's a gaming laptop, I would strongly suggest to leave it plugged in. Battery life is shorted than I expected."
843,"Good laptops are hard to get a hold of, and this one was no different. Found it here and jumped on it for my son who is going into the ECE program and needed this level of performance."
844,"Excelente computadora, instale todos los programas que utilizo para arquitectura y los manejo muy bien, el único inconveniente es que se calienta bastante por lo que los ventiladores trabajan a su máxima potencia."
845,"I got the ASUS gaming laptop for my young son who likes playing various games like Roblox, Fortnite, and Mine craft, etc. I figured it also would be useful for him to have as a backup for working on school projects and other research since he could take it with him wherever he goes."
846,"Summary: My current desktop is an older Dell XPS 8920 from 2017, which has a i7-7700 processor.  It's still decently fast running Windows 10 Home.  I haven't had a dedicated gaming machine before, so I am very sure that this i9-12900 with the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti card is going to be insanely fast!  The last laptop we bought was a 13-inch MacBook back in August 2020."
847,"Buying a PC is such a daunting task if you’re like me… Desktop or laptop? Business or pleasure? Accessories? Upgrades? With so many options, I was so happy and lucky to find this beauty!! The price was right and the specs were right where I needed them for a casual gamer coming from console. It being upgradable (RAM, SSD, etc.) only sweetens the deal. Buy buy buy! ASUS even offers an extra warranty extension for submitting reviews like this one!"
848,"This is a great entry level gaming laptop.  I've tried a few others and this one (being the cheapest as well) I was most impressed with.  Albeit the RAM (which you can add more), it's perfect for what I need it for.  I play mostly MMO's and this thing handles them with ease.  I don't notice it getting super hot, I do hear the fans go from time to time but NOTHING like other laptops I've tried."
849,"So far I love this computer. I love how there are different profiles built in based on what the user needs at that moment (silent, balanced, and turbo). Has handled every game I've thrown at it so far better than my Xbox One. Honestly. Wish I'd ordered this beast sooner."
850,I play Minecraft and I can get 200 fps at a minimum I can get 400 fps sometimes and you can run shaders at 40 fps with minimum lag I also play valorant on it and it is great overall it is a great gaming starter laptop for the price I love it it is amazing
851,"I bought this computer in hopes that I could use it for schoolwork with the occasional light gaming. After owning this computer for over 3 months I can safely say that it is perhaps the absolute worst laptop I have ever used. Despite upgrading the total ram to 24GB, installing a 1TB SSD and updating everything, it still frequently crashes and freezes multiple times a day. There are also issues with the GPU not being able to render images properly and instead showing everything as two red and blue imagies shifted out of alignement, making it nearly impossible to use."
852,"No cuenta con camara web, lector de huellas o de SD. Pero es bastante buena para la mayoria de cosas que uno quisiera hacer con una computadora portátil. Windows 10 inicia muy rapido, renderiza bien los videos y tambien sirve genial para edicion de imagen. Puedo jugar call of duty ww2 en graficos altos. Y la bateria dura unas 6 horas con un uso basico. En fin me encanto, y creo que tiene un muy buen equilibrio entre precio/calidad."
853,"Bought this laptop because I thought it would be able to run games well, but less than a year in and it constantly blue screens, freezes, and intermittently won’t connect to the internet."
854,"It is a good Laptop, the only problem is the auto brightness. It is almost impossible to disable it, and it is so annoying because you pass from see nothing to get blind. Not sense, you can check asus foros, all people complain about it."
855,"I've always bough Asus laptops for my family in the past due to minimal bloatware and a focus on quality. The machine I got this time has made me question that. While the internal components are good individually, the unit I received regularly bluescreened, even after all windows updates. The screen occasionally went black, like the connection inside wasn't good. Lastly, upon further research, I found the laptop was built with soldered RAM, preventing future upgrades. By far the worst Asus product I've ever purchased."
856,So far I’m super impressed by the speed of this computer it is amazing quality for the price you’re getting it at. Overall a great bye easy to set up any good work or leisure computer. The screen is nice.
857,I've been mostly gaming on the Xbox Series X since getting my hands on one last year and left my gaming desktop to collect dust. That beast draws a lot of power and it started to feel burdensome to boot it up occasionally just for personal needs and very light gaming for short bursts of time. So I decided on getting a budget friendly laptop (this one) that I can keep off to the side while my Xbox takes over my main monitor.
858,"The laptop it’s self is amazing, it runs smooth, good response time, quality is super clean. HOWEVER there is one major issue, FREEZING , the screen freezes after 2 weeks or so. I did some research and apparently it is common for most Asus laptops to freeze over time. This is a waste of you money I would recommend a Msi gaming laptop I have a cousin who has had one for over a year and I just switched and it’s way better."
859,"Low FPS in all games even when running the bloatware software on gaming mode. Super loud fans, screens and size are good but extremely bad bottle necking with the terrible cpu and 4 gigs of VRAM."
860,Me encanta lo silencioso y rápido de este equipo. Sugiero que cuando lo compren pidan una RAM de 8 GB adicional y un sólido de un Tera para complementarlo. Por lo demás... TODO BIEN.
861,I wish it had a built in  web cam for his online classes but this has been a great laptop for my son in college. I have an asus f17 tuf and love it so this laptop was an easy choice. Come on Asus! A military grade built gaming laptop for an adrenaline filled 19 year old that wants to climb 400 feet in the air to work on windmills and likes to game? Good job Asus. Really good job. 5 stars+
862,"Please I highly advice! Dont buy this laptop it is the worst built laptop that there is out there, yes the specs will get your attention and you might get tempeted but just dont. Put your money somewhere else"
863,"The pc has only 3 months and then it only stopped working, I was reading a document and then it only went off and now it is not able to power on again. I am from Costa Rica and now I have to send the pc to an authorized support service and pay more than 80$ just to check the device. So, I believe I will have to spend at least 300$ on that. Thanks, ASUS."
864,"The quality of this laptop was great given the price. I would definitely recommend anyone new to the computer gaming scene to get this laptop as a starter. The graphics quality is amazing, it runs so many games, and best of all it's a fair price. I've only had mine for a short time but I know this purchase will be one of my most valued for a while to come."
865,"This was a gift for my 17 yr old grandson who specifically asked for this laptop. He says he loves it. Also, as a user of a 17"" ASUS ROG laptop I have found their products to be excellent."
866,"Before purchasing. I read the other reviews and thought ""why not give it a try"" I'm sure glad I did. It's a great laptop at a great price. Just be aware of a few things if you do end up getting this one, see below..."
867,"On paper it has all I need - 144Hz screen, slim build for travel and 3050Ti graphics. I've been using it after I received it in a nice package. It's been satisfying for my gaming needs - 2K, RD2 etc. But I will only buy it is on sale. For the list price, I will buy a one with more powerful graphics card."
868,It may not be the best computer in the world but it can be upgraded to be much better than it is. I just wanted a reliable and up to date laptop. This has far exceeded my expectations even only a day after receiving.  Will update in one month
869,"On spec, this computer has all - 144Hz screen, RTX 3050 Ti, slim build and all other parameters that are critical to the gamers. It has great build quality, excellent screen and response and light enough to carry for travel. I gave 4 starts instead of 5 because I think it's worth buying when it is onsale. If at list price, at least I think it should have RTX 3060 or 3070."
870,"This is a quote from the manual. I can understand if there are chemicals inside the device but if I have to wash my hands every time I even ""handle"" it, it is probably not safe. I returned it and wish this warning would have been included in its description as I would not have purchased it. This whole process caused a great inconvenience."
871,Laptop was missing RAM when opened to try and figure out why it would not turn on. had to purchase ram and still did not turn on and boot contacted asus to be ignored on the phone kind of upsetting for an item that cost a lot of money. I dont know if i should get another one or just search else where for a different laptop. Was hoping to have this to cheer me up but has only made my mood worse
872,"El equipo llegó dañado, empezó a reiniciarse después de presentar en múltiples ocasiones el temido error de la pantalla azul, después la pantalla se quedaba en negro y no daba imagen hasta el después de varias veces de apagarlo y reiniciarlo respondía pero se pegaba donde el fallo que se ve en la imagen o iniciaba Windows para tiempo después volver a pegarse. No pude probar el equipo ya que nunca funcionó desde que lo recibí."
873,"I dislike this product, because after two normal uses it stopped working. I thought I did something wrong and followed up with tech support. The device did not want to display anything. So, I decided to return the device. Bad experience buying a laptop via Amazon."
874,"I'm a Truck Driver that does long hauls so used for watching movies / TV show some gaming hadn't start yet on gaming,, received mid August 2021. Woke up December 08 2021 the screen doesn't work anymore!! WTF for over $1000 and is supposed to handle extreme temperatures, my cab doesn't get below 32° f very disappointed, attempting to troubleshoot but computer doesn't display  built-in screen as option?!?!"
875,"While the price was enticing, the performance of this laptop was very deceiving. By the time I had realized how poor the performance was - it was too late to make a return. Build quality and esthetics are very nice - just a poor performer where it counts most unfortunately.  The hardware undermines the design and esthetics. I do not recommend."
876,I used the computer for a while and after a couple of months notest that some of the programs were not running adequately i started to check the specs of the laptop and compare it with a specialist and the graphic card wasn't included im very angry with this buy dont trust this seller
877,EDIT: 4 Months after purchase the screen has died completely and now I have to send it asus for them to repair under warranty with an estimated time of 6 months. Stay away from this line of products
878,"The display on this computer stopped working after 4 months.  I have asked for warranty but ASUS wants to repair the product instead of replacing.  I have a huge issue with this.  I did not buy the product just to have it opened and repaired before the warranty period is even over.  Now, if it even gets repaired, I will have a substandard product that I purchased at full price.  I will not buy this cheap crap again.  Sorry ASUS you lost another one."
879,"There is nothing ""TUF"" about this piece of garbage.  Six months in and several of the keys have fallen off and can't be reattached.  Why can't a single company make something of decent quality anymore?"
880,"Upon opening the box, in which I always take video, the computer, once turned on had no screen action whatsoever. Completely black. I would highly recommend purchasing a different laptop."
881,If you want to get a good laptop for gaming do not buy this one. The 3050 ti gpu is pathetically poor GPU because of the 4gb VRAM. Because of this fact you will have incredibly reduced frames than you would have with an actually decent gpu. You want at minimum 6gb vram for good gaming. You wont get good gaming with this laptop.
882,"I've had this laptop for a little over a year now and it has been absolutely terrible.  The laptop has done nothing but crash since the day I got it and should not at all be considered a ""gaming"" laptop. Broken keys within days of first use, horrible overheating issues, headphone jack doest work, BSOD issues. Will never purchase anything from Asus again."
883,I have used 4 laptops before this and this is the worst of all. Keeps restarting every hour. Can’t event open web browsers properly and gets stuck all the time.
884,I ordered the laptop happy from all the reviews till it came the box was wayy smaller than expect but still I opened the box little to my surprise it was a bottle of perfume in it instead of my laptop
885,Well when I first started up this computer is gave me a blue screen of death.  Reinstalled Windows same issue.  Not a good impression for Asus Laptops. Returned ASAP. I suggest avoiding this laptop.
886,"Had it for almost a month. Works like a dream. Two issue that I have are the fan noise, it can get very loud at times and the ports, sometimes the HDMI port and the audio jack ports act up but nothing too bad."
887,"Excelente relación precio y características, el monitor de recurso interno es excelente para evaluar el desempeño con las aplicaciones. Lo único que no me gustó es que solo tiene un slot para la memoria ram."
888,"Look elsewhere. This laptop had all sorts of video issues. I use it for Adobe Premier and it crashes constantly. Drivers are up to date, computer is clean. I would not suggest this at all. I can't even image the gaming on it. :("
889,"Al principio no sabia que esperar, tenia miedo que fuera a llegar dañada o con un problema de software, pero al contrario, la laptop llego en perfectas condiciones y funciona super bien sin ningun problema, ya la probe con varios juegos y los corre fluidos sin problemas, una muy buena compra"
890,"Laptop runs amazing, fast, responsive. Only thing that is a but of a downer is how hit the laptop gets after a short period of gaming. I'm not talking max settings. I'm taking about medium settings. Other than that this is a great laptop"
891,"I work in video games, so before buying a new laptop, I spent a lot of time researching my options. I'm very glad I ultimately went with this one. It's sleek, fast, and a lot quieter than my old MSI. Both working and gaming has been a pleasure thus far."
892,I bought this laptop because the price was good and the specs seemed decent. After I set it up and tried to game on it many games such as Fortnite and COD Warzone they stuttered badly. The CPU was pegged at 100% and almost all the ram was being used. I ended up returning it in favor of something with a better CPU.
893,"No matter what I do, I can’t get display to look good. It’s really bland, no vibrancy, and the backlighting is very dim. I have to crank up the gamma/brightness in every game just to see what’s going on. Everything else is fine otherwise."
894,"This thing is great, runs like a champ, I can multibox 3 Diablo 3 games with ease, plays biomutant great, from startup to playing in 5-10seconds, no complaints on my part."
895,"Completely useless after a year of owning this computer. I used it for editing less than 30min videos, streaming football and LOL. It glitches out and does not recognize my plugged in accessories, I’ve verified it’s not the accessories with another computer and they work perfectly. Highly recommend if you only want a good computer for about a year."
896,"This is the first time I buy a gaming laptop, and I must say it exceeded my expectations. Everything I tried runs smoothly. Great price range from my point of view."
897,"Laptop looks nice and everything works fine, but I’m getting 50-100 fps on LOW settings on Valorant. I just bought this laptop a few days ago and it’s already like this. I already went on YouTube to tweak the settings to improve my in game fps but nothing’s working. Already tried setting it to High Performance, playing around with NVIDIA’s settings and it’s still the same. I got better fps on my old laptop that has inferior specs… Did I just get a bad laptop?"
898,"The screen had yellow tone , even i had calibration it, still very yellow. if you using for gaming, that is no problem. if you using for photo or video editing, strongly recommend connect other monitor. ( FYI, as my checking, that screen is 69% SRGB)"
899,Will download games that you have to pay for but messes with your phone and all the apps on your phone and there is not even a Built-in camera is very slow Mentioning gaming battery life and no camera quality
900,"Loving it so far! My other laptop is another ASUS but an AMD Radeon. This i7 + RTX3050ti is a BEAST compared to that thing. Alien Isolation PCVR on the Quest 2 looks IMMACULATE. And while she runs hot, not nearly as hot as my AMD laptop."
901,"I'm sorely disappointed in my new laptop. While using Google Chrome and Spotify, my laptop blue screened due to overheating...three days after arrival. I will be returning this product in the next few days. Sad because I've enjoyed everything else about this computer. Blue screens a less than a month into new usage is unacceptable."
902,"Es una computadora que se siente muy bien en la parte del teclado y se ve muy bien la pantalla, pero se queda marcado tus huellas en todas partes donde tocas este aparato (punto malo) a la tercer vez q la use comenzó apagar cada 15 segundos la pura pantalla x 3 ocasiónes y enseguida se apagó definitivamente y solo quedó prendido el teclado, así que piensen en adquirir está máquina."
903,"Bought this laptop as a lower level gaming PC. It arrived on time and in good condition, started as it should have. I had some problems playing any games at first as the drivers were not up to date, but when that was finished, it became possible to load them without crashing."
904,"The first thing I did was double the amount of RAM in this machine. After that, everything stopped stuttering and I could play pretty much whatever I wanted (mind you, I'm generally considered an ""old school"" gamer and get around to AAA titles 5-10 years after release if at all). The laptop just runs and that's good enough for me."
905,"El producto tardó 2 días en presentar el primer pantallazo azul, luego solo fueron errores tras errores. En total recibí como 5 pantallazos azules y cada que la encendía me decía que debía escanear y reparar el disco de almacenamiento… Ya hice el retorno y estoy esperando la devolución del dinero y en teoría por lo que hablé con servicio al cliente debería recibir la devolución del envío ya que viene con malos funcionamientos de fábrica (Desde Colombia fueron al rededor de 160USD). En mi opinión deberían optar por otra opción o contar con suerte al comprar ésta laptop."
906,"It’s a great computer for the price point. Easily upgradeable ram and hard drive. The ram upgrade is a necessity for this type of computer. It’s not going to play the latest AAA games great. If your just looking to play Fallout 4, 3 and NV on Ultra this is the computer for you."
907,"Bought a Used Like New one and everything looked brand new, but the device was already signed into and encrypted. Battery life was also only going up to 95 even when plugged. Had to return. So be aware of that for anyone buying used."
908,My laptop works pretty good. I had a couple of technical issues (eg NVidia video card disappearing) and tech support was absolutely unhelpful (after spending a very long time with them).
909,"The Dash F15 is a very good machine with a top-notch 144hz IPS panel display and excellent built quality for the price, but it has one bad and one good+bad point to consider."
910,"*Extremely durable and sturdy feel to it. Keyboard feels amazing, and display looks absolutely terrible. (Display looks as if the brightness setting was capped at 85%, a common and, at this point, memeable recurring issue with TUF displays )"
911,"So far, the computer's flawless when it comes to work-related tasks. Although the battery doesn't last as long as advertised (which I'd expected), 8 hours is still pretty good when compared to other gaming laptops."
912,"So far after three months of use this laptop has been great, I have no issue at all so far. The performance from this small package is just great for work, video editing, photo editing and gaming. Video editing 4k video tends to get slow but it still gets the job done."
913,"This laptop is awsome, but the 8gb of ram just makes your GPU to bottleneck, if you want to get full just upgrade it with single-channel 16gb ram. Everything should go smoothly."
914,Is a good laptop and is awesome for the price also many details should have take in consideration for people that the laptop for programing and use the keyboard in spanish and si that the keyboard don't have a <>  key.
915,"The biggest thing was top clamshell part of the screen was pure metal, making the laptop resilient and durable. The screen picture and resolution was delightful, from the moment I turned it on to the many weeks after. It was capable with running Monster Hunter World pretty much on the higher quality without much problems. I just hooked up an XboxOne Controller and went to town. (I'm a PS5 Player Myself) overall very happy with My purchase. I would buy another in a heartbeat."
916,"Overall this computer is a good entry level gaming laptop, especially for under $1000. The GPU is strong enough to play pretty much every game at 1080p/60 on high or ultra settings. Do make some notes though:"
917,the screen is beautiful though got no camera great for gaming though i got it for architecture and it crushes absolutely the cad softwares though still struggles with lumion i think due to graphics memory but has a fast intel chip especially for the price
918,"Just a few things that I don't like, but I am okay with it. First off, this laptop is that the initial 8 gigs of ram are soldered onto the motherboard. But with that, you still have a empty ram socket that you can use to upgrade your memory size. The 2nd issue is that this laptop only supports NVME SSD drives. I tried to install a M.2 2880 ssd drive and the computer didn't even recognize it at all."
919,Overall good laptop! I use it for gaming only and it runs everything I want smoothly. I upgraded with another 8gb stick of ram and a 1tb nvme. Battery life could be better but it's not that big of a deal to me.
920,The battery life is the biggest thing that isn't the best on the laptop. When the laptop is plugged in you'll get max performance out of it. If it's not plugged in when it's on the last bit of the battery it's very slow. *TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION* It's running a lot at once and a really powerful laptop. When the laptop is being used just make sure to plug it in that's all.
921,Llego en buenas condiciones me sorprendió esperaba que fuera menos potente con respecto a los juegos corre el jedi fallen order en gráficos altos generalmente bien y es un juego reciente la batería como cualquier computadora gamer no dura mucho cuando estas jugando a lo mucho 1 hora 40 min o 2 hrs esta muy bien contruida se siente resistente y me gusta mucho su pantalla con marcos muy delgados y el teclado también está bien y es muy comodo en general es muy buena computadora para empezar si es que no eres muy exigente
922,"Bastante bueno para su precio aquí en Chile, ya que lo eh llegado a ver hasta a 1.3m en paginas nacionales, eh visto bastantes personas aquí en las reseñas de Amazon  quejándose de que no es buen calidad precio, pero consideremos que aquí en Latinoamérica estos pc son poco accesibles, realmente lo recomiendo, alcanzo altos FPS y temperaturas bastante normales hasta ahora, eso si agregar casi obligatorio 8GB de RAM más, también recalco el pésimo servicio de DHL en mi país, pero esto es algo fuera del producto y Amazon así que realmente vale la pena este producto."
923,The screen is kinda dim out of the box. There is some customization options in the pre-installed software that helps with this. But even on vivid or fps modes. It's still kinda dim.
924,"The computer is perfect for a small gaming setup. The problem I had was that you need 16GB of ram to run fortnite smoothly on max graphics, apex sometimes will stutter, and even small games like roblox will have your fps a little less than their max potential. And GTA will stutter badly after like 10 minutes of running the game. But after i upgraded the ram to 16GB it ran perfectly."
925,"For the price I bought it for at a discount, it’s a great PC to have for gaming & everyday use. The battery does drain fast but. When you are gaming it is a great a experience. It’s great for gaming on the go."
926,"Por el precio es lo mejor, cuando puse gta v al maximo va super fluido a la perfeccion. Los ventiladores trabajan al maximo por lo cual hacen ruido. Va muy muy bien para trabajos normales y uno que otro juego que tengo."
927,Casing looks cool but is a plastic assembly. RTX3050TI is runs most games Smoothly. Is an ok laptop for a moderate gamer on a low budget. I don't play much so I'm happy with my purchase. I would have preferred to save a little more and get one with a better GPU.
928,"I've had the laptop for approx. a month, and there hasn't been one negative so far.  Its super fast already with 8g ram.  I was planning on upgrading to 16 ram, but I don't think i need to..."
929,"This company is very responsive immediately. They were of great help when I had a question and product was shipped same day and delivered by next two days when delivery date was way later. They made it happen. The laptop is amazing, highly recommend this company and products!"
930,"The only downfall is, it doesn't have a camera. Other than that, everything has been working really smoothly, it loads supper fast and I'm overall pretty happy with this purchase."
931,"Great computer that runs really smooth. I had an issue with my previous laptop running so slow even when I first bought it. Now that I have this one, it’s so satisfying to have a computer that finally works the way it should. I’m not playing crazy high quality video games but Dota 2 runs perfect, I’m pretty sure it can handle most games. Over all satisfied"
932,"Everything is fine with almost games, but I play forza 5 with my 8GB RAM not enough with this game, also there's main problem with this laptop the battery is bad with the games"
933,"I might update this at a later date if I find something to be good or bad, and please note I am not a professional reviewer, I'm just basing this on how it fits my needs."
934,"I shopped a long time for a laptop that met some bizarre requirements for for FHD frame rates even though I do not game. But my last 3 Asus purchases (desktop, tablet, 17"" laptop) have been quality products and this seems to be no exception."
935,"I gotta say, this PC's specs had me going. I was all excited and ready to game and work using this thing. Saw YT reviews and unboxing and was ready for it. Expected 70-90 fps with Warzone."
936,"I maxed out the ram out of the box, so its right at 40 gigs. This device is used for editing 4k drone video, writing estimates,  pretty much real time."
937,"I like the laptop performance, Good for gaming, business and entertainment. Love the Audio Quality and I wish the laptop come with at least microphone. Camera not present in the laptop is fine. But microphone is necessary for Audio conversation"
938,Great laptop. I added a 32 to bump the memory up to 40 GB and a 2 TB ssd card for game storage. It handles Alyx in VR with no problem ( plugged in of course) and the classics with ease.  Very easy to work on. The case is very sturdy . All around good laptop for gaming or video editing.
939,Love that it not to heavy and it as nice look to it. I wish that the ram was not solder on. That way I can add 2 16g ram stick
940,"The laptop is pretty good but it heats up fast, the battery isn’t as long as I thought it would be and there isn’t a web cam. All in all though it’s been good so far"
941,"Had this laptop about a month now, works as intended no issues, performs well for the light gaming i wanted to do when i feel the urge for pc play."
942,I got this laptop for $700 on prime day. It’s a great laptop for gaming. I would strongly recommend to upgrade the ram by adding another 8gb for a total of 16. I went from getting 40-60fps in Destiny 2 to 60-80fps after the upgrade.
943,"I've only had this laptop for a few weeks now, but it seems very good for the price. The screen resolution is good, the boot up time is low, and the battery life is much better than my previous laptop. They keyboard area really shows where your hands leave behind oils, which would be my only very minor gripe with it."
944,I've only had it a day but so far this machine is flawless. Very easy set up even if your not very computer literate. I've had the best performance/longevity with Asus computers throughout my lifetime more than other brands so I do not doubt its performance. I record music and this can definitely handle most of what I need. I do plan upgrading ram just for better plug in performance.
945,Se recomienda hacer upgrade al hardware ya que su rendimiento aumenta al máximo. El contra que tiene es sólo un slot para memoria RAM (tiene 8 GB de RAM interna)
946,"La computadora es buenísima, no da problemas pero se calentó tanto que casi senti que me quema las piernas. Tendrian que comprarla con un abanico para laptops para que no les explote. También cuando conectas el cargador se pone negra un segundo, lo cual es raro aunque no le hace nada malo ."
947,My Wifi just stopped working one day saying there was an issue with my max address when I went to the asus troubleshoot center and I haven’t even paid it off yet (had it less than 4 months) It was a good laptop until I couldn’t use the internet at over 4.0kbps send my receiving seems fine but I can’t log onto anything it takes forever to load anything and if I can’t use Wi-Fi then I can hardly use this laptop since a majority of the things I do require internet
948,"I love this laptop, the only thing thar i dont like its the screen, its a little dim for my taste and the color profiles are weird, but the refresh rate compensate it."
949,Out of the box it was wasn’t working well. After a day I was able to set it up and got it running but it ran slow and the screen froze multiple times. The next day when I was turning it on it said that auto repair had failed and the drive had to be wiped clean. I got it when it was on sale and I like the model but now I’m going to have to pay more money for the same product. I love having a 1000 dollar paper weight.
950,"The game was great in terms of running games, it can run games such as GTA and Fortnite with decent graphics. If you are more into games such as Roblox or Genshin Impact it runs them great. Overall the gaming is great, however, the battery is very bad when using it on the go. The best way to get the battery to last is, as is most devices, turning the graphics, screen brightness, and fan speed down. Overall good, could be slightly better."
951,"The system performs quite well and easily handles any game I have tried to play on it.  The battery performance during gaming isn't great, but 144hz refresh rate and power consumption of the video card during gaming does whittle the battery performance down fairly quickly.  However when used for school and maxed out for battery performance, to include restricting to a 60hz refresh rate, the system easily lasts and entire day at school for my son without needing to be plugged in to recharge."
952,"Small but powerful, the screen is easy on the eyes till you get into gaming. After playing with the intel graphics command and playing the games again, and changing the colors, contrast, saturations, I was able to get some nice colors with brightness nothing perfect mind it. These are the settings for me, but nothing is the same."
953,"The Laptop is very good and performs good at every level while gaming, But literally two weeks of purchasing the fans started making noise, I know that It makes noise because of the demand etc..."
954,"I really enjoyed my purchase of this laptop, everything works well but the battery life isn't very good unless you use it for the bare minimum on the lowest power settings available. For 999 plus tax it was an excellent purchase but now that the price went up I'd probably look for other options on that price range. Very satisfied nonetheless"
955,"Decent computer, I had the i7-12650H with GTX 3060 model. Computer overheats so much even just idling. It got to the point where any sort of heavy load made it inoperable. I had to buy a separate cooling pad just to use the laptop so now I have to carry that thing along as well. Also only have has 500 GB of storage which filled up after 4 games but it’s to be expected (upgradable though)."
956,The laptop is pretty laptop. For the specs you pay for you get a good deal and it is a pretty good slick desgin. I want to put it out there I just got it. But from using it it's pretty nice. If you got the money do it and like to play games I guess I will edit it once I play a game. The game I will be playing is rust.
957,"Great PC for work and play. I use it as my main travel PC for videos and music production as we as games when I have some free time. I purchased it because you get a 12th gen i7 plus ddr5 memory, a built-in graphics card, and thunderbolt 4. I am very happy with my purchase. Oh, yea I almost forgot ASUS is giving me a 90-warranty extension just for telling about my purchase! Wow! Another reason to buy."
958,"The laptop is really well-built, fast and simple perfect for work, study and gaming, the only thing to have in mind if that you are heavily gaming it can get hot, so I would recommend a cooling base/stand, but this is a great laptop for the price !"
959,"This laptop really exceeded my expectations. I am receiving a warranty extension from ASUS for giving my feedback however I genuinely recommend this product for anyone who is looking to do gaming and be mobile at the same time. It is very light for its purpose, specs and quality."
960,This thing is a gaming beast. Able to run most games on ultra. It does get hot around the upper keyboard but that was my only complaint. Battery is good unless using it for heavy tasks or gaming. So your self a favor though and upgrade the ssd to at least 1 terabyte. Super easy to install as this comes with a second SSD slot.
961,Great midrange laptop that is above average and powerful for gaming to work. Gave a 4 stars as think some improvement on the camera/mic and sound could be a improved a bit. Overall it is a very versatile laptop and so far happy with it.
962,"Other laptops with same specs cost more.  Although this is a little heavier than those, the lower price is a great tradeoff.  Charges incredibly fast, but do wish it came with a USB C charging cable instead of a barrel plug since it has thunderbolt 4 port."
963,"Had it for less than a day, started windows update and after a second restart it never got to Windows again. Reinstalled bios, tried to reinstall windows, nothing worked. Maybe I got a bad one, but it was definitely frustrating."
964,"I’ll keep it simple, i love the design, the specs are really good especially for this budget (i got it for 999$ on sale) and overall it is a great gaming laptop. Love it."
965,Laptop looks great and is super fast. Only issue is while playing a game it would over heat really bad. Top of the computer would get to hot to touch. I even purchased a cooling fan for it and still would get the same way. Would’ve kept the laptop if this issue didn’t come about.
966,"The laptop uses a powerful cpu in tandem with a upper midrange gpu to provide good performance overall, with decent battery life and the ability to charge it using USB Type C portable charging. There are some strange problems with my specific unit, but they haven't interferred while gaming or doing work, so I would recommend this laptop if it goes for around $1100, as it then has excellent value."
967,"After updating all the systems software on the computer and using it for a few weeks it still runs as expected and very well at gaming, typing, and student task. I would highly recommend this item to others because the value to performance factor is great on this laptop."
968,"When unplugged, the screen bugs out and flashes all different colors every minute or two. Tried reinstalling graphics drivers and even wiping the OS from scratch. Seems to be an issue with one of the ASUS built in software tools that controls the 2 video devices in the laptop. To top it off, Amazon is making me pay for return shipping. Suffice it to say, I probably won’t be buying electronics from Asus or Amazon anymore. If you wanna game on the go, try a Steam deck."
969,System arrived next day.  Opened it up turned it on and after a few hours of standard updating the system was ready for use.  Sound system was surprisingly good.  Very speedy boot up.  Keyboard light kept flashing until after the standard upgrades were applied.  Recommend gladly.
970,"Bought the 2022 model with 16 gigs. Play mostly league and older games to be honest, but I absolutely love the thing. It looks great- sleek but not obnoxiously gamer design. Web cam is pretty bad, but better then nothing- which is what most other gaming laptops in this price range will offer. Word of advice, avoid having the armory crate open while gaming, and make sure to let BIOS update to current before making a final judgement. I had performance issues prior to sorting out those two issues, but now it runs perfectly."
971,"Soy de Ecuador y al inicio estaba un poco dudoso de importar la laptop a mi país o no, al final lo hice con miedo por los malos comentarios que tenían estas laptos en sus versiones pasadas y por lo dificultoso que sería para mi tramitar una garantía. Pero sin duda esta portátil tiene un buen desempeño:"
972,CPU temps were hitting 97C when gaming out of the box.  With throttle stop and changing power settings to 99% cpu max and turbo disabled gets it down to about 82C which I think is still too hot.  Cannot undervolt as they have it locked so you cannot.  Will change my review if I can get the temperature down more but for now beware.
973,"This is definitely the best purchase I have ever made as far as computers. I spent a lot of time reading up on laptops because I wanted to make sure my son had just what he wanted and with this, he definitely does. He can do all of his schoolwork but most importantly to him, it is excellent for gaming. It is fast and the graphics are really good. He loves it."
974,"It’s been about 6 years since I last built a PC rig and decided it was time to upgrade, I bought the 2021 version and realized it only had 4 cores, returned it to buy this 10 core beast! I am very pleased with its performance 2022 model is a significant upgrade!!"
975,"When I started thinking about buying a light and powerful affordable laptop, the only option was the 2021 TUF Dash, but it had a 4-core bottleneck CPU. Later, the 2022 version was released. This model has a good 10-core i7-12650H CPU (6 P-cores + 4 E-cores) and 105W RTX 3060 GPU (80+25 Dynamic boost), so I bought it as soon as I got the chance."
976,"The keyboard is defective. Every time I press ""P"" key it gets stuck. The battery status sometimes drops suddenly (e.g. from 100% to 80% in just a second). I requested a return days ago, but the UPS is not coming to collect it, and the only return option they provide is UPS pickup, which sucks."
977,"2022 May production date! i7 12650 is a killer, but it gets hot very easy when playing game. The watcher program needs to set or it will be over heat. Wish they put in a 1TB instead of 512GB. Otherwise, it works prefect. Great money for its value!"
978,"Aunque en los primeros días me tiro un reinicio raro, luego no tuve ningun problema a la hora de usarla, corre bien en juegos como Valorant, Spiderman, así tambien en programas de Arquitectura como D5 Render, Lumion, Autocad, sin ningún problema si tuviera que ponerle un pero es el almacenamiento pero eso se soluciona usando el slot de ampliación, tambien destacar que ninguna ram esta soldada, es decir ambos son reemplazables sin tener que prescindir del dual channel de ram"
979,Amazing laptop for gaming and work. It’s fast and responsive and the new Windows 11 is amazing for productivity. The new interface is much easier and cleaner to work with. The camera is not amazing but for work it’s decent that it gets the job done. The price to performance per buck makes this laptop a  steal to buy. This is a solid recommendation for anyone and to young people such as college students.
980,"Got it for 1000$( discounted price) and its gotta be the best I have spent , absolute bang for buck. Works perfectly, great performance. Just use a cooling pad while gaming and you’ll be fine with the temps."
981,Killer laptop Asus built it to last brilliant.Asus you keep on making the best.2022  12th Gen Intel I7  RTX3060  Mux switch  Thunderbolt 4.Pricing unreal. Was worth the wait thanks Asus
982,"This is the best laptop within this budget. Super smooth, fast and low noise. Asus is also giving warranty extension of 90 days for giving feedback of the laptop. That’s great!"
983,"I am satisfied qith this purchase. This computer is powerfull and run all aplications very fast. The quality of materials is excelente it seems to be a durable laptop. The only I would like to be better is about the camera. The video calls looks noisy, but it is ok"
984,"Es una excelente computadora la tengo ya casi un mes y la utilizo con programas de diseño y no me a dado problema cumplió mis expectativas, los ventiladores en el estado turbo y cuando trabaja al 100 si suenan fuerte pero nada que pueda incomodar, me sorprendió lo ligera que es, tal vez el inconveniente que le veo es la batería dura poco, pero en fin calidad precio es de lo mejor que se puede encontrar"
985,La potencia que tiene a la hora de jugar y trabajar ya sea como productor o diseñador gráfico. solo veo un único punto que no me agradó mucho que son las temperaturas a la hora de jugar juegos muy exigentes
986,"This is for the 2022 model which has some serious upgrades on specs from the earlier model.  First, you are dealing with a 10 core chip, and not the underpowered 4 core i7, so that is substantial. This was always a weak link in the prior version.  You are also dealing with 16gb ddr 5 (not 4) ram, so that is both more and faster but note that upgrading ddr5 ram will be more expensive than upgrading a ddr4 machine so you may have to wait for ram prices to fall a bit before upgrading."
987,"En primer lugar me sentí estafado ya que a los pocos días que compre esta laptop a $1,299.00 se puso en oferta a $1,069.00 o sea pagué $230.00 más los impuestos que esa cantidad representan. Ahora con el tema de la pantalla cuando está el fondo negro se ven unos destellos por toda la zona del marco que se ven horribles, da la impresión de una pantalla de mala calidad. Por todo lo demás la laptop es muy potente y estéticamente agradable…"
988,"Seems like a great laptop so far. I want to note that is only comes with 1 SO-DIMM slot, the other is soldered. I am purchasing a 32 gb stick to try and at least upgrade it to 40 gb. Although overall first impressions are great. I had no idea that ASUS had a 1 year complimentary accidental damage protection."
989,"Gran velocidad de encendido, carga, ejecución de aplicaciones. Último hardware en procesador, memoria, video, disco. Teclado impecable, marcos diminutos, ligera de peso, amplio touchpad, teclado numérico incorporado con mínimos marcos en la base para tener el máximo espacio posible completamente aprovechado."
990,"Over all oowww awesome power laptop for this price. this is my stock trading laptop 16gb/512gb ssd very fast!!! lightweight and thin, for me the down side is flat keyboard not use to it yet and wish the battery last longer."
991,"I’m not a huge gamer, but I love playing the sims 4 and a few other easy games on my time off. The only thing that I noticed having this laptop is that the battery runs out very quickly when I’m just doing regular stuff like browsing through, I always have to have it plugged in so I can have a good time playing. Other than that, I’m happy with what I got. Runs the games smoothly & everything else works just fine. I’m just not going to use it when I have no where to plug it, I guess."
992,I am a teacher and bought this to put some education software on and use for personal use. The lighted keyboard is awesome and I am totally happy with my purchase so far.
993,"Obviously a 1650 won't be able to run the newest games at maximum settings but it's still a very good laptop.  I was able to play GTA V for a few hours without any issues.  I'll be testing it more extensively next time I go on vacation but for now it's 5 stars.  EDIT: I have now taken it on 2 vacations and played quite a few games on it, this laptop is still 5 stars for the price.  You can play pretty much anything on it for extended periods of time."
994,It’s a good laptop to use on the go especially for gaming just for small games nothing to big or new but it can most games good and the quality of the screen is great worth the 600
995,Nothing bad to say I've played like 4 to 5 games on this and it's a good deal plays newest stuff on good fps I'm really happy and impressed w this laptop so far
996,"I like it, Only issue is due to low ram amount it may crash during overload. Also MAKE SURE TO UPDATE EVERYTHING! It may be obvious but if you don't it will constantly crash and freeze"
997,"Relative had asked me to find a suitable laptop for them since theyre returning to school, initially I was looking for a Lenovo like my own but for some reason those dissappeared a month prior. Anywho the other Lenovos were not to my favor with price to specs so I looked into ASUS as the next best thing, low and behold ASUS TUF gaming laptop!"
998,"--Note, after 3 weeks of owning i decided to return this. I stand by my review, i feel the laptop is good for casual gaming, but i ended up wanting to PC game full time, and this wasn't going to cut the mustard."
999,"Bought this PC for my 18 year old daughter as a beginner gaming laptop and the laptop handles World's of Warcraft, Sims, Seven Days to Die and many other large games flawlessly! Now we did upgrade the amount of R.A.M from 8Gb to 32Gb. But it's a great laptop."
1000,"Es un buen equipo y cumple para su función perfectamente, mi equipo presento un pequeño problema con su batería ya que dura menos de 1h estando en ahorro de energía y sin funciones activas y uso de redes sociales y videos."
1001,"I bought this laptop for work and when it came in, the volume buttons didnt work, the brightness buttons didnt work, i couldnt acess the settings panel through the windows tab. I couldnt even change the rbg lights on the keyboard which are are supposed to be able to with a REAL one. It's a waste of your time to get one of these. They deleted my old review because they said it went against community guidelines but it didnt at all."
1002,"A sus computer... that's for sure. Unit will no longer boot. Screen stays black, fan turns on, backlit keypad cycles through rgbs. Contacted ASUS, sending the unit back to be wiped and os reinstalled to secure my data. Return window expired on Amazon but they are allowing me to return the product. Never had a computer completely fail so quickly, so disappointed."
1003,I purchased this laptop for school and within a week of purchase the laptop is not charging. Attempted to reach out to customer support and they were limited in the support they could offer. As someone who is being inconvenienced with this faulty laptop they could have at least offered some sort of support or incentive to remain with the brand they didn't and I would be returning forthwith
1004,This laptop is such an upgrade ...my absolute favorite is the multiple -colored backlit keys that scroll ever so gently while I'm working...pretty jewel tones add a super -rich touch...the keys are so great to see and access...the laptop has a good solid weight to it...the sound is really great...the HD quality is there for sure.
1005,This laptop runs Warcraft shadow lands on high performance setting it’s a great little gaming machine runs smooth. Easily upgraded with 2nd drive and second memory stick.Back opens easily for access. I’m impressed with it.
1006,"It works great!  I do not use it for gaming.  The laptop came with 8GB of RAM.  I immediately added another 8GB.  I highly recommend it, unless you are a serious gamer needing a better graphis card."
1007,"Received this and immediately went to town getting all my stuff installed and together.  First thing I noticed was that the fan is pretty aggressive.  Built in software can help with that a bit by tuning it for what you're doing.  Still audible, but just fine in my opinion.  Everything runs pretty smooth, until you get to some more intense games.  I think the 8GB of RAM is just a little on the low side and I suspect adding some more will do wonders."
1008,"Keep in mind I am not a true, hardcore gamer, I do not compete nor take games too seriously. This is a very good computer. Upgradable for memory and speed. Monitor has brilliant colors.  Setup went fast and easy."
1009,Worth every penny! If I had to come up with 1 con it would be that the USB slots are pretty tight and sometimes difficult to use. Looks really sleek and performs great.
1010,"I bought this to upgrade my son from his previous laptop, which was a Mac. Absolutely worth the money, great investment. He loves to play online games and is having no issues running them."
1011,"I purchased this laptop to replaced my old ASUS laptop,I needed something faster and runs smoother however I do have to add more ram because it does slows down and sometimes freeze. I wasn’t intended to use it for gaming I just wanted it for normal internet browsing,and also using it when I’m live streaming for twitch that’s about it. It’s a beautiful laptop I definitely like it very convenient for me."
1012,"My hubby is the big PC gamer, I am a consol peasant. However, there are certain games we have been itching to play together and they are either not cross platform within game or just PC only. When we saw this deal I thought ""well my old laptop is laggy AF and has no memory and was never meant for gaming"" so we decided to get this in place of a full blown PC set up (which we didn't have space for even if I wanted it)."
1013,"I'm not a fan of Windows at all, however I decided to leave it as dual boot with Linux. As is usually the case with laptops, battery life is much better in Windows than it is in Linux. That is an inherent issue with Linux and not a detriment to the laptop itself."
1014,"I love it, its pretty good! Was able to play ROBLOX in high quality level and it made the experience so much better since this laptop has a very fast speed quality.  I'm also very satisfied with the battery life. However sometimes when I open a browser, it sometimes take a little while but at least faster then my old laptop I've had and saved a lot of my time. That's all I have to say and ty ^w^"
1015,Works great after updating the wifi driver. Before the update it would keep dropping connection. Wish it had 16g ram but not a big deal. Otherwise great laptop so far.
1016,"I recently purchased this laptop on a lightning deal off of Amazon. I have to say, it was well worth the money! In my short time owning this laptop, I've put it through multiple gaming tests, workload tests, and just day-to-day usage. As such, I will write a pros/cons list to demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of this laptop so you can decide for yourself if it's a worthwhile purchase."
1017,"I play RuneScape on this computer, and thought about running WoW on it, but I doubt it has enough space for a game that big. Very well built laptop and runs smoothly so far, battery dies pretty quick. Overall great computer for the price, can’t beat ASUS!"
1018,"I got it to play games. Unfortunately, I can't play games. Skip this and save yourself heart break and frustration. You can do far better. Just because the price "" seems reasonable "" is not a good excuse to get it. Save up to get better. It just won't stop crashing no matter what I do."
1019,"We received this laptop and after 2 days the WiFi stopped working, I returned it and only got back 80% of what we paid for it. Very disappointed! Be aware of these models."
1020,"It's what I expected, great screen and fast enough! Sound could be somewhat better, but it is a laptop! Will add a hard drive and memory latter. Would buy again!"
1021,"Pros: La computadora es buena, su pantalla es excelente con buen brillo, la velocidad es acorde y lo que se espera por lo adquirido, el teclado es suave, teclado iluminado con opción de apagar, la calidad y materiales se ven buenos o duraderos, agrada la facilidad ara actualizar o mejorar la laptop."
1022,"El equipo llegó excelente pero cuando se probó las bocinas tienen daño cuando llega una notificación se escuchan con estática o un ruido extraño como si la bocina estuviera reventada, prácticamente no quisieron hacerme el reemplazo y solo debía enviarla"
1023,"Very poor to make people have to upgrade this because of the cheapness of the company. Why even ship this with single channel 8GB RAM only, and call this a gaming PC? Throw another 8GB stick in for your customers at the cost of what? $20 for you? Very disappointed in ASUS to be honest. The overall memory is lacking as well. Screen is nice, 3050 is meh, it depends what you want to play - but please for ""gaming"" 16GB should be minimum now with windows 11, and adding another stick will not bankrupt the company."
1024,"Just a couple days prior I had gotten a Lenovo product with similar specs a little but cheaper. However the quality difference between an Asus laptop and Lenovo is easy to tell at first glance. The Asus is built with much better quality materials, centered TouchPad, etc. Also Asus is completely functional when it arrives (not broken, looking at you Lenovo!). Thanks again for quality and speed Asus!"
1025,"i got this on prime day for about $300 delivered and had a good feel for what i was buying, a bit disappointed with overall performance and battery. first thing i did was upgrade ram with an 8GB stick for better performance then i tuned windows 11 for better performance with fewer visuals, turned battery charge stopping point to 80% for longer battery life.  also i installed avast AV as i heard windows defender was causing performance issues - probably fixed by now"
1026,"I love the size. It's exactly what I needed for my small business and personal needs. The fingerprint scanner is awesome and so convenient. My only complaint is that I didn't realize it didn't have a built in webcam. It makes it difficult for zoom or anything like that, but I'm managing. I have not tried adding my own webcam extension at this time."
1027,"Es un buen computador por el precio, pero entiendo que si 4GB es poco para Windows 11 deberían dejarlo saber o vender laptops solo desde 8GB en ram, aunque sean un poco más costosas."
1028,"This thing has windows-s loaded so you cannot load anything not microsoft approved. This completely kills the benefits of using a Windows system. If I wanted a system that policed everything, I would have purchased an ipad and I already have an ipad."
1029,This laptop is top notch! It's no power house but it doesnt need to be (for me). Size and battery life for this laptop are my most important options and this device doesn't disappoint.
1030,This extremely small and beautiful Laptop is extremely fast and very much worth the price. Thank you to Amazon and the Seller for this sale to South Africa and for all the other Asus Laptops and Asus Routers.
1031,"Initial reaction - expect a $300 laptop to do $300 laptop things. It's not powerful. It can run kind of slow simply because the specs of the hardware aren't great. Wouldn't recommend this for your main computer, and you shouldn't expect to run any modern games on it."
1032,"This is a decent, basic little laptop. Perfect for student use and other typically daily tasks. Not for hard-core gaming or photo editing stuff like that. For basic surfing, web use, streaming,  it is a good choice. Easy to get set up and straight into use, so you don't need to be a computer whiz to use this - which makes it good for younger kids as well as individuals who are not so computer savvy. Overall, not bad. Don't expect a work horse and you'll be happy with it, I think. It is basic, yet efficient."
1033,"This is all you need for basic web surfing, work or school. I like how quickly you can access it with the touch of the fingerprint sensor. The keys seems small while typing but good enough to use and enjoy. The backlit keyboard can easily be adjusted with a few brightness levels to choose from. It's compact, feels light and slim. It runs smooth! I wouldn't try any gaming on this one in particular, but it's a great laptop overall for general use."
1034,Got this laptop to take to school so I wouldn't have to take my Asus z g14. I was looking for something that wouldn't break the bank and something that is reasonable in price-to-spec ratio. For $300 this is no doubt the best laptop you could buy.
1035,"This ASUS VivoBook 14 F415 Laptop works perfectly for what I got it for! I wanted something inexpensive but still usable for my 10 year old, I mean if I wanted to keep him off my $3,000 XPS then he needed something of his own. Basically I got this for him to practice typing, of course doing other things like playing Minecraft…lol."
1036,In terms of functionality it works very well and is capable my only qualm is the screen which changes color at every shift and feels fake so just beware if you are doing visual work
1037,I purchased this laptop during recent Amazon prime day and have been very satisfied up to this point especially for the price and savings. It has more than met my expectations from easy setup all the way to battery life. The fingerprint security feature is definitely a plus. Almost sure my awesome purchase satisfaction will continue through usage.
1038,"It's overall good, but battery life is kinda short compared to other laptops at similar (or a bit more expensive) price. Also the cpu is fine for regular works but I can't recommend it for playing games or some other graphical works. Audio quality is also not so good (but it doesn't really matter cause I use headphones). The biggest problem in my opinion is the heating. The laptop heats up fast."
1039,"This is the most unresponsive, slowest computer I have ever seen. It BARELY functions out of the box. It can’t keep up with typing in an email address, it cannot stream any service tried (Netflix, Hulu, Disney+). The delay is infuriated and this was a total and complete waste of money. DO NOT BUY."
1040,"I have to admit, I was pleasantly surprised with this purchase but since it was replacing a nine year old pentium laptop with the same memory and drive size that ran pretty well (when it powered on) I figured why not. I wasn’t disappointed. The I3 is quick. I’ve been using it for midi projects and it’s worked out better than I had hoped. I may still add more memory down the line but I really see no rush to do so."
1041,"Love that it is not small! Needed a bigger laptop and this was perfect!!! Well was excited and did the Asus 90 day warranty as well, to be shot down cause the laptop won’t come on at all! Called technical support to troubleshoot, and laptop is dead! Awaiting replacement. I pray this second one will not let me down. I will get the Asus 90 day warranty on that as well."
1042,I bought this on Prime Day for $270. This laptop comes with 4 GB RAM soldered on board. It is very easy and inexpensive ($35) to add an 8 GB RAM module. With 12 GB of RAM this laptop runs noticeably faster and smoother.
1043,"Overall for the price it is a good computer. I bought it for my year travel. It is light and compact, perfect for travel. I mostly bought this computer for the light up keys. I tend to be on my computer a lot when it is dark, so I need the keys to have a back light. Unfortunately, although it is sold saying there is back light keys, there is not. I am very disappointed in my purchase to due the false advertisement."
1044,THIS COMPUTER IS TERRIBLE. THE MOUSE WILL GO OUT EVERY SO OFTEN I EVEN TRIED TO RESET AND STILL COULD NOT GET THE MOUSE THE WORK.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME BUYING THIS PIECE OF CRAP .
1045,There is no back-lit keyboard. The manual says to use F7 to change the brightness of the keyboard but there is no function on the F7 key. Disappointing as this was the main reason I picked this one over others.
1046,Compact design easy to tote. Starts up fast and performs well. I use Microsoft 360 to do excel and word documents. Has wifi and Bluetooth so I can hot spot anywhere. The keyboard is not back-lit as described.
1047,I liked the style and the concept of the number/ mouse pad but it's glitchy. It's extremely slow when loading regardless of great reception. It's also not such a good idea for outdoor day use because the screens always seems dimmed even on high.
1048,"I bought this specifically to turn into a retro DOS emulation laptop.  It's nice and small and doesn't take up much room yet, for the price, the build quality is surprisingly good.  I actually like the feel of the keyboard better than my 2020 M1 Macbook Air."
1049,"Ya había comprado este computador antes porque lo necesitaba de tamaño pequeño y todo salió bien me enviaron uno de 11 pulgadas como lo especifica el anuncio, luego lo compre nuevamente para alguien mas y me llego un computador de 14 pulgadas. Me enviaron un computador mas grande y lo había comprado precisamente porque lo necesitaba pequeño."
1050,"I purchased this for lite school work. However, windows sucks on this little guy. By installing pop os (a Linux distro) it is beyond perfect! Upgraded the HDD to a 1tb and we're all good!"
1051,"The screen is sharp and good looking,  Solid and fast with a big battery.  Makes for a great travel computer at a exceptional good price.  Installed a 500gb SSD drive... you must initialize and format it before you can use it but it works well and along with the additional SD micro card of 256gb I have plenty of storage."
1052,It’s a little small but great for the money ...still trying to get the 1 free year 365 set up which makes it worth it for school and work other than that it’s awesome
1053,"This laptop is perfect for basic use (i.e. web browsing, streaming, office work, social media, etc.).  Battery life seems to last for a while, charges fast, and has decent wi-fi connection.  Good for family use and/or individual.  Would not recommend for gaming :-)."
1054,"This is a great little laptop. I was skeptical at first when ordering it but it did have a lot of good reviews so I took a chance on it and am glad I did.  It serves my computer needs, is lightweight and small enough not to take up a lot of space on my desk but has good screen quality."
1055,It’s a little small but great for the money ...still trying to get the 1 free year 365 set up which makes it worth it for school and work other than that it’s awesome
1056,Una de las cosas que más me interesa de un laptop es el backlit porque es en la noche cuando ocupo este computador para ciertas cosas personales. Por eso la compré... Pues no viene con BACKLIT aunque lo dice en la descripción.
1057,It was a gift for my aunt whom is a cancer survivor and I got her the deal lol but thank you amazon couldn't of done it without you best prices bravo 👏👏
1058,"Really surprised, performance is better than expected. I'm only using it for personal use; emails, shopping, accounting and such. It's quick to start and light weight and I like the key- board. Great purchase for the money."
1059,"Don't buy this item!! Just stop working on my today out of nowhere. It sits on my mini desk, so no I have never dropped it. Big waste of money so upset with this item and seller."
1060,"If you need or want a laptop this one's is good for that. Very inexpensive but very good with the internet, gaming, general writing is good as well. It's thin and light weight. We did purchase this laptop for basic gaming. We are able to use it for playing World of Warcraft. No lag in animations, good upload time. Only down side is we had to purchase a wireless mouse and wireless keyboard. Just easier to get around everything. Definitely recommend!!"
1061,"Don't like dragging around a full size laptop? Then this might be the laptop for you. Great affordable means to browse your bills at a whim and to be ready to smash that pay button on any bill of your choice faster than they can say ""where's my money"". Be sensible, be mobile, be a great bill payer!"
1062,"Great little bargain. Just dont use for a lot of things it cant handle it. Just using for online classes, its great and what a deal. Very happy with purchase."
1063,The wifi range is terrible. The number keypad really slows you down because it comes on so easy. Drives me crazy. Had to by a mouse to stay away from touchpad. Runs slow when multiple tabs are up.
1064,"I have just used it to get my emails, pay my bills, and to print my labels for my online sales. I also have utilized the 1 year free Personal Microsoft Office to draft letters. It was 1/3 of the cost of my older Dell laptop and is quicker, user friendly and so easy to use. If you are looking for a lightweight, small, basic laptop, this is the one for you!"
1065,"Got this as a birthday gift for my mom (who is not tech savvy). She likes to check her email, watch Youtube videos, and go on Pinterest. This does that and it's easy for her to travel with and navigate. She's had no issues with it."
1066,I love the small light weight of this computer. But had I known that the quality of the carmera was poor. I would have not purchased it. When I am doing zoom calls or blogs it very grainy and not very clear. It will work for now. I wish I would have research this a bit more. Also another down fall was the number pad and mouse control. I found it difficult the rapidly type and not hit the on button for the 10 key pad. Outside of those couple of factors it is a fair computer.
1067,"Hey, for a $250 dollar laptop cant beat it. Besides microsoft wanting to control every aspect of my laptop experience its a great laptop. Never used an ASUS brand computer before but i do now moving forward. Great product. Fast delivery."
1068,I bought this in April 2 months later the screen turned black on me I barley used it I tried everything this was a waist of money and I’m very disappointed it’s no way I should have problems now
1069,It’s a fast computer with not much memory. I hook it up to HDMI and use it for playing in areas of the internet which are not financial. I use a Chromebook for my financial things.
1070,"Small, light weight, QUIET. Does all that I need it to do and then some. The number pad is a nifty little addition and is actually quite helpful. Pleased with my purchase and would certainly recommend to anyone who needs a laptop for the off occasion, but I do not believe it would hold up to the wear and tear of a heavy-use computer. But for $199, you get more than what you’re paying for."
1071,I bought it seeing high review but utter disappointed. In 45 days it stopped working. The power button wouldnt work. I tried troubleshooting but no use. I lost a chunk of data. No cheap laptop anymore.
1072,"I only leave reviews if I’m very pissed or very happy w the product- I’m glad it’s the latter. I love this computer. Light, small but not too small for me at all- I can still get my work done know problem and the speed is just fine.  I love how light it is.  I have had bad computer luck so I had low expectations... so I was surprised. Yayyyyy!"
1073,Good little machine however the processor speed is actually 1.1ghz flubbed out when trying to take a exam that required 1.8ghz minimum  I don't know what up to2.8ghz means but it failed to handle a1.8 test
1074,I'm a die hard Mac user but needed to have a Windows 10 computer.  I got this little computer and put a 128 GB memory card in and I'm super happy with the performance.  I didn't want to comment until I was used to the product and I actually had given it a change.  I like using it.  It's an easy set up.  I'm taking advantage of the 1 year of Microsoft 365.  Thanks ASUS for a good product for a reasonable amount of money
1075,"I've had this laptop for a few months now and so far it has been great. It's fast enough, lightweight so I can take it anywhere, and easy to use. The only cons i can think of is the calculator location. I turn it off, but it's really sensitive and will turn back on while I'm scrolling and the side of my hand brushes it. It's definitely easier to turn on than to turn off."
1076,"You get what you pay for, that's why I am giving 4 stars. I needed a reasonable laptop asap that's why I bought it especially for free office 365. Really not a fan of that number pad thingy, I found that totally useless. But for the price, it's a good laptop for everyday works."
1077,"Screen quality is low for graphics, and fine for text and basic web browsing. Web cam is poor, but better than nothing. No touch screen, but keyboard is good and all day battery. Great for a light use carry around for sub $200."
1078,Excellent for what it is.  You're getting a extremely portable usuable computer for under $200 that can serve movies up at 1080 p when HDMI out is connected. You get snappy enough web browsing and the light version of windows doesn't seem to be the resource hog it might be on full systems. Great if you need a cheap ultra portable laptop for basic computing. Far cheaper than an iPad and arguabley more useful.
1079,Spent 2 hours getting this laptop set up. It was slow to load. Next day signed on and tried to get on the internet. Screen went blank. Tried ctrl-alt-delete- nothing. Shut down and restarted. Nothing. Total junk. Will replace with a name brand.
1080,Screen was good but touch screen sucked...the lol mouse would disappear from screen and just pop up anywhere and wouldnt click on items the 1st click(it takes multiple clicks to get to where I'm trying to go).
1081,"Decent for the price. Got this for my 7yo sister, perfect for her school work and some youtube. Don't expect much from this thing, If you just need a social media scrolling machine, school or lonely binge watching, then go for it."
1082,"Ordered it for my friend. At first when I saw this laptop, I was skeptical about it usage and being prompt. But I still remember I started using it for testing purpose and was not able take my hand off of it for more than couple of hours. It's well equipped for all basic needs. On top of everything the 365 preinstalltaion for 1 year is like awesome. It's a deal in given price."
1083,"I needed a quick and cheap laptop for travel.  This machine deliver on both points.  I wouldn't want to work on it for long periods, but for checking emails in a hotel it worked fine.  This is almost the equivalent of a burner phone.  Use it for a while and toss it when you're done."
1084,"False advertising in reference to the backlit keyboard. It does NOT have that. Speakers are not loud at all so if you dont have headphones or a quiet space, it can be inconvenient."
1085,"My 13 ye old bought this with his allowance for playing some game called TF2. It works, but he has to constantly delete crap to make space. Other than the lack of storage space he says it works fine."
1086,"It was smaller than I expected, but that's on me.  I was used to 15"" and 4"" smaller makes a difference.  battery life is good.  Beware the touchpad disable button in the row at the top of the keyboard.  I inadvertently turned it off and thought the touchpad had broken.  Also, I accidentally touch the turnon button on the touchpad that activates its numbers.  All in all a good purchase."
1087,"the pad has a button to click so that I can use it as a number pad, but the number pad just didn't work, so that just made the whole thing not worth it.  If that didn't work, what else won't work?"
1088,"This laptop is going to be the perfect travel companion. It's lightweight, compact, and surprisingly fast. I wasn't expecting too much, but I am quite surprised at how smoothly, and quickly everything loads, and runs. I would recommend this laptop to friends, and family. I'm really enjoying it, and can't wait to watch Netflix movies I've downloaded on my next flight at 39 thousand feet!"
1089,"I like it just fine, but I NEED HELP! I pressed some sort of KILL button and can’t get it back on!  I’m a writer who has to write everything from an iPhone12 mini now!  Please PLEASE!!  I can’t even print off the instruction manual now and can’t see the screen on my phone well enough to search for the 494 answers to 494 other questions.  IF SOMEONE HELPS ME, I WILL CHANGE MY REVIEW."
1090,It's great for travel - light and fits easily in pocket of carry-on luggage. I use an external hard drive to eliminate the need to transfer data every time I get a new laptop so storage capacity is a non- issue.
1091,"I'm very glad for having bought this laptop. It's just what we needed for our 10-year old boy to use in his online schooling. It's screen size is the perfect size for him, and the camera works just fine even with low light. We're about to buy a second one for our 12-year old girl, for home schooling also."
1092,You decide what apps to install. I just use a total of four apps and it always irritated me that until now every computer I've owned has come with apps I had no use for and couldn't remove. This time I can pick and choose.
1093,This laptop is fairly good for the money. I have tried to use the touch screen  but it is not really useful for what I bought the laptop for. I am not a gamer so I have not used it for that purpose. I use this for Design Space which is  a web program used for Cricut  and Canvasworkspace for Brother Scan & Cut (both of which  run only on Apple and windows but not on Chroebook
1094,"I bought this laptop just to do college work on, as soon as i set it up i downloaded chrome and the laptop is struggling to close 1 tab. I expect more from asus but i guess nothing is as good as it used to be. Kind of disappointed because im sure ill have to buy another one within the next year. Save your money and buy an HP or mac."
1095,"It works decent for running emulators, not what would be considered a gaming quality computer. I am happy with it, especially for the price. If you want gaming or high quality, you have to pay way more money. In my opinion, it's a good little laptop than can do what you want to do."
1096,"Love, Love, Love the size and weight of this laptop. Easy to take with me. Screen quality good and keyboard easy to use. I'm not sure I like the ability to switch to the numbers keypad as I sometimes do it accidentally and don't use numbers often, but overall great product and would advise anyone to purchase it."
1097,"So it’s a great starter laptop, good battery life, decent storage, all around pretty decent. What my problem with it is it has a problem where it lags out then “shuts off” per say and the only fix is to hard reset it. Other than that pretty great all around"
1098,"This is a great little laptop. Web browsing, streaming are very nice. Great touch pad response. Keyboard types well. Fairly quick loading. Make sure to buy a micro SD drive for extra space for sure though. Main drive doesn’t have enough space with Windows 10 constant updates of course which is around 30+ gb usually. I love this purchase however. I needed something like this"
1099,"I recently did my purchase and I'm in love! It's very compact and complete, I used only for my homework so I don't ask so much. I love the fact I can control my phone by this and hopefully has a long life."
1100,"One of the reasons I purchased the ASUS Vivobook Go 12 L210 was because of the advertised backlit keyboard. As I was setting up my new computer yesterday, I was having a temendous amount of difficulty turning on the backit keyboard. I spent hours researching and trying to troubleshoot only to discover that this computer doesn't have a backlit keyboard! I am beyond furious and frustrated that this advertising includes lies; what a waste of time! What else is a lie? Buyer beware!"
1101,Works great no issues not using in s mode  it’s great for what it is no complaints  we will see how it lasts  one of the best products I have bought from Amazon
1102,The sound on this was not loud enough so decided to return it.I don't want to have to use earbuds to listen/watch videos.....When i went to set it back to default settings it wouldn't do it.....Dideled with it for 1/2 hr and finally said  f it!.
1103,The XML file was not stored for this computer. I can only get to the internet in a place that does not require a password. Gave the computer low scores because of the hassle.
1104,This tablet has been a god send. We take it with us when we travel so we can do our banking and pay bills. It is not a touch screen. The only down side.
1105,I am very happy with my purchase. Got the computer laptop for my sister's birthday. She had no idea that I ordered it. I have to order a lot online and Amazon is awesome. Thank you so much.
1106,"Nice little laptop and very nice keyboard. The seperate number pad in the touch pad isnt great, but works. Normally the number pad is off. I'm not a big computer guy, but this laptop is nice and the speed seems to be very fast (Celeron processor using windows 10). The screen is right on the edge of being too small for me, but it hooked up easily to my 40"" Samsung LED tv and using mostly mouse functions (wireless mouse) i set the laptop aside and actually do not use it at all."
1107,"I went to the ASUS rep and they would not listen.  They continued to tell me to do things as if I were on the web or the computer was up and running.  IT NEVER WAS!  Also, the packing was horrible.  One piece of brown paper that did not even hold box.  Shabby packing and maybe that is why problem"
1108,"I bought this to hook up to my TV so I would watch my kids sporting events that were being streamed on-line.  It is fine for that.  Not sure about anything else, because that is all I use it for"
1109,"I bought this comp knowing it was a bargain price at 200.00. However I read all the reviews and thought ok, I'll enjoy it for maybe a few yrs. This comp is the worst I've ever owned and I'm 65. It's buttons stick, serious lag to the point it's unusable. I don't do much on it except brouse and emails, so it's not the load on it.. I had to buy a new one and I'll never, ever, get anything from Asus again. Very disappointed. It should not have gone downhill so fast and in so many ways. Disgrace!"
1110,"This is an AMAZING computer. I got it this year. It is very sturdy, durable, and very reliable. The disk space is amazing and it came with windows 10.  Asus computers are the absolute best. I love them and would choose them over Dell or other name brand computers. The battery life is phenomenal as well. I definitely recommend this product."
1111,Thinner than my old ASUS so very portable. I bought this strictly for using my CRICUT printer. Clarity of the screen is great and for its purpose I am glad I didn’t purchase a touchscreen machine.
1112,"This is a decent, but limited, laptop. 64GB is just enough to run Windows OS and Microsoft Office. Remember, also, this is EMMC memory and not a true SSD. I got a 256GB SD and formatted it to NSFT so I could put my OneDrive on it. If you want to install anything other than Windows and MSOffice, I recommend looking for programs you and install on the non-system drive. That limits your choices."
1113,"I did not purchase this as my primary laptop. I bought it to chuck into a suitcase for travel, or use to look something up while watching TV. It boots fast, very lightweight, seems sturdy, fast enough. I also exited S mode and did all the updates. The webcam is unusable."
1114,"I struggled so hard to figure out this laptop. Granted, it is my first, but I have had desktops before, and they were much easier to navigate. Unless you're already a pro-teckie, it will frustrate you."
1115,This is a great little laptop. I needed something for simple things like the web and a couple games like the hidden object adventure games. It surpassed my expectations and I'm actually going to order another one for my daughter just for the heck of it.
1116,So far so good with the computer. Why I left 3 stars in total was because of how I found it. It was shipped to a friend's and they left it by the road up against the mail box. My friend never knew it was here. Other than that the computer looks good and runs nice no complaints yet about that.
1117,"I highly recommend this Laptop For Students in College, I mainly use this laptop for Editing Videos for YouTube, and It's one of the best (In my opinion) starting out Laptops, it came With Microsoft Office, and The Ram allowed me to Download Vegas Pro 18."
1118,"I needed a laptop for 4 things: Microsoft Office, email, internet and streaming. This is a great laptop if you need the basics. I can watch a movie, answer emails and use Office. It's got a great battery life too!"
1119,Does NOT Have A Backlit Keyboard Like It Said It Did.. Very Disappointed Because I love Asus An Own Couple Gaming Ones An Had Gotten This One To Use For Work Since I Work At Night An Seen It Says An Shows in The Pictures It Has A Backlit Keyboard. Which I Got Excited.. Untill It Came Today An NOPE.. Guess Not Taking This One To Work Tonight..
1120,Bought it for when I moved because I didn't have a laptop. Then I bought a tiny USB 256gb drive and run Linux without messing with the Windows partition. Winows sucks. After the move I use as my desk video player using external speaker.
1121,"The on/off bottom of the touch pad is located on its upper right corner which becomes very frustrating if you are right handed, you will touch it often inadvertently, shifting to calculator mode while you continue unaware. If you are left handed, it will be out of your way most of the time, but not completely."
1122,"This product was BETTER than advertised AND arrived 3 days early!! Its awesome and does all the things I need for backend music production on my DAW. This laptop works seamlessly with all of my gear and made installation quick, effortless and pain-free! I'd highly recommend this product and look forward to buying from the seller again!"
1123,My son got one for his birthday and loves it and if had the money I would buy my self one ! Love how easy and very nice it is.
1124,"I have always found Celeron processors to be the most reliable workhorses, and since I wanted this computer to function as a reliable little workhorse for the type of work that doesn't require 5 cores and 50gb ram, it was actually a selling point for me. The Celeron is as expected - medium speed, zero hiccups or hangups, mild exclusion from some of your fancier computing ambitions (compatibility)."
1125,Bought this for my son. HE ABSOLUTELY loves it.  He uses it for online video game playing and for school. He is not a hard care online player (thank goodness) so this LAPTOP works great for him and his use.  I am glad I was able to buy this for him and have it work well after all the reviews I have been reading. thank you public.
1126,"Remove the false advertisement price of $88. Pathetic false advertisement at it's best, while searching for cheap online. Wow only $88 for this piece of tech, CLICK, reveal $249 price tag. Low, very low of who ever decided that play."
1127,"La laptop venía sellada, sin embargo, el teclado venía con detalles levantadas las teclas, por lo tanto, no es aceptable ya que es posible que se levanten todas las teclas."
1128,the change from windows 10 S mode is a concern. battery life is good. i don't need to bring the charger outside. the screen can flip to 180 degrees but no further. overall good for daily use (generally).
1129,"For surfing the web, checking emails, streaming music services, this is perfect!  Nice construction, lightweight and compact, and beautiful design.  I especially LOVE the inclusion of the USB-C port, which I will use to connect to a portable external monitor.  For every day tasks around the house, this fits my purposes perfectly."
1130,"We ordered this laptop for my nephew for school. There were specifications for the processor that were necessary. When we received it, the specs for this machine were not as advertised. Now, we have a laptop that he can't use and we need to get a new one. I am very disappointed with this purchase."
1131,"The version of Windows installed on here prevents you from installing most software programs (e.g. Mozilla, Adobe Acrobat, etc.). So it's limited mostly to internet browsing. I bought this purely for only paying bills to maintain security when logging into bank accounts, credit card accounts, etc. This is perfect for that."
1132,"Was looking for an inexpensive Windows computer and this fit the bill.  Great price, all the features I was looking for in a ""just used just sometimes"" computer. Portable. Solid feel."
1133,"No Touch screen featured for this lap top. Not able to do  zoom call(sound cuts off). Still a great mini laptop.  It's really small. portable. Ok for simple games. Battery life is awesome. great for documentation and surfing the web. Great view. on the screen.  I am not a techy person, so I can't offer more reason why I am pleased. Save everything to the cloud."
1134,"flash memory not as good as SSD, Windows S allows only apps from microsoft store, it's not really a ""computer"" more like a tablet with a keyboard that runs Windows...you can upgrade to Windows Pro for $50 though and that's great considering its $100 to upgrade from Windows Home to Pro...get this for someone who doesn't know a lot about computers and just wants to get online"
1135,The chromebook is very nice. I like how I was able to sync my phone and all my apps to the chromebook. It's easy to set up and use. Very slim and lightweight.
1136,"I purchased this laptop because my previous laptop had a broken screen, and I did not want to pay much for a laptop I really only use for light internet browsing and coding. I also would never consider running Windows on a machine that is this limited."
1137,"I bought this for my upcoming trip to visit my daughter.  It was very easy to set up and I had no problem taking it out of  Windows 10S and installing the regular Windows 10 on it.  What I like about this little laptop is that it is very light, it worked fast on my Wi-Fi at home and the screen quality is decent.  I did buy a SD micro card to increase my storage capacity in case I want to save anything.  I highly recommend this laptop and I am very pleased with the performance thus far."
1138,"Me encanta, es ligera, compacta y rapida en modo S. Buen rendimiento de la bateria el teclado es comodo y trackpad sensible. Lo que no me gusta es que le teclado no es retroiluminado"
1139,"This laptop is great! Its small, convenient, and reliable. The only problem I have with it is it was said to have a backlit keyboard and it does not. This was one of the features I chose this laptop for. I can make it work for now but is a let down it was marketed as something it is not."
1140,"If you like using Microsoft Edge, this computer will be great for you. I prefer Google Chrome and when I downloaded it, the computer slowed down to a crawl. I have the comparable model to this one that is 6 years old and it's still snappy and responsive with Google Chrome, so this computer is not going to work for me."
1141,"I couldn’t believe the condition of my laptop, considering it was refurbished. I was able to add Microsoft office without any latency and the screen is beautiful. I also love that it’s light weight and very durable. I’m glad I made the decision to purchase this."
1142,"It’s not a touch screen computer so I’m not sure why it has that as a ranking option. I do not play games so I don’t know if it’s good for that. But, I use it for school and for the price I really couldn’t ask for more"
1143,"One of the main reasons I got this laptop was because I saw it said it had a backlit keyboard. Was a very important feature for me when I have work at night. Only to get it, and the keyboard is normal. On top of that, I already have to position the charger a certain way for it to charge ... it’s also a lot smaller than I anticipated, but I can get past that."
1144,"The laptop is very small, just wider than the keyboard, which makes typing with fat fingers pretty difficult, and also to find the [back] key! When having volume up, I get an annoying alarm sound until I lower volume. I using the box it came in as a table while sitting in chair, so it should not be overheating. Should have plenty of ventilation."
1145,"I don’t play any video games or use programs that require a high amount of processing. I surf the Internet, check my emails, do some work and banking etc. online. The size of this laptop means that I am more likely to take it with me versus a larger machine. I still travel with a tablet and do use that as well but there are just some things that a laptop is much better at doing."
1146,"I needed a cheap pc for my new job and this fits the bill. I’m a Mac person so I really didn’t want to pay a lot for this. For a pc, it’s fine. However, the finger pad has a number board that constantly turns on when you are typing. If I could figure out a way to turn it off completely, I would. But it doesn’t look like you can. Overall, it’s cheap, it runs, it serves my purpose."
1147,Works great no issues not using in s mode  it’s great for what it is no complaints  we will see how it lasts  one of the best products I have bought from Amazon
1148,The sound on this was not loud enough so decided to return it.I don't want to have to use earbuds to listen/watch videos.....When i went to set it back to default settings it wouldn't do it.....Dideled with it for 1/2 hr and finally said  f it!.
1149,"This was a great buy, set up was easy.  It states has backlit keyboard, I don’t see that feature.  Plan to ad some SD memory.  Lite weight and slim.  Great purchase.  I use it for email and surfing the net"
1150,I bought this laptop to my 11 year old daughter for her school works. It seems to be the perfect size for her. She loves the touchpad’s calculator option because she needs it for her math. I bought a 256 gb sd card to extend the memory since it has a card reader it’s very convenient to use. We received 1 year ADP which is relaxing to know. After 2 months of usage we’re really happy with this purchase.
1151,"Everything functions as expected. I needed this for work, school and business and as far as I can tell this will get the job done. This is a smaller computer so keep that in mind. The keys are also kind of clunky, and it can be just a bit laggy. “S” mode was simple to turn off so I was able to download other programs and apps. I’m satisfied. There’s nothing more to expect from a brand new $200 computer."
1152,"I've been using this laptop(n4020 11.6"") for a week and it's pretty good for its' price. Well product's quality is better than I expected, I used more than 15 laptops and I must admit that it feels good tbh. BTW, it doesn't have keyboard light. On the pictures it says that the pc has keyboard lights but it just doesn't. After the installation the pc has 26 gb free space."
1153,Bought for mainly my daughter and her school work. I use it for bills and to print out weekly reward charts. Perfect use for this. It is speedy and a good size for younger kids elementary school age to use for virtual learning. I have not had her or myself play any games on it as of yet although will update the review when we do.
1154,Originally for the $6 I paid for it I thought it was going to be great it worked for about 2 months and I keep it perfect condition and then one day I'm in the middle of my Netflix and it just powered off never came back on and then after that every time it came back on screen would go black and I couldn't use it it was shut off but the power light would still be on but the laptop would not be active
1155,"I wouldn’t recommend this laptop unless you want a laptop that lasts less than a week. I have had laptops before and they lasted me for years, not this one. So buyer beware"
1156,"El precio del equipo estaba en USD200 y no aplicaba impuestos ni aranceles, pero al incrementar el precio a USD230 implica que si uno es comprador en Colombia se le incrementa a USD300. Dan descuentos por compras al por mayor?"
1157,"First it works fantastic. And it is fast due to SSD. Also while the specs don't say anything about it, there is a slot for upgrade. I put WD 500 GB in it and worked like a charm. Very impressed."
1158,"The description plainly says the keyboard is backlit, which played a major role in my purchase decision. If that's important to you, pay attention to the reviews saying there's no backlight on the keyboard. The listing is wrong!"
1159,USPS delivered this today. Big box with a fairly big box (and padding) in it with a small and light laptop in that. I had it unpacked and charging in no time.
1160,"I am getting used to this small size, I have always had a 14 or 15 laptop.  When I use the touchpad for 2 finger scrolling, the screen sometimes slips.  Also, it is not loud enough for me even with the settings all the way up.  I must admit, I am 70 and my hearing is not what it used to be even with hearing aids!"
1161,I'm the type of person who looks at the overall rating and only reads the negative reviews. I don't know what anyone can say negatively about this laptop. It's off the hook amazing for the price. Very light. Portable. Fun to use. Amazing.
1162,"1. Out of the box, the screen was glitchy--display blinks every 20 seconds or so, and occasionally, when it comes back into view, the whole display is offset by about 150px from the left edge of the screen."
1163,MICROSOFT JUNK. Good luck getting out of S mode. Touchpad died after a few days. USB port for the mouse works when it wants to...not often. NWO crap. Do Not Purchase.
1164,This laptop just completely stopped working. Ive had it less than 2 weeks. I used it twice and the third time i tried to use it it wouldnt come on anymore.
1165,"Bought one because my old laptops are aging and slowing down. For the little bit I use it for, mostly weather/space browsing and making some video's this has been a nice small laptop. No regrets from this purchase!"
1166,"Cute, easily portable, but it doesn't like it if you try and use Google Chrome, which is my preferred search engine. But besides that, its functional, which is was I was looking for."
1167,"This VivoBook L210MA is an AWESOME Laptop. I didn’t want to lug around my expensive Apple M1 Macbook to and from work, so I needed something that was a bit smaller, 11.6”, lightweight and well-priced, this was it."
1168,"I really enjoy this laptop. it's just what I was looking for and the price was perfect. My question is, I have a few much-needed programs that I use and need, This IOS is in Windows S mode. if I delete the S mode and go to regular windows, would I be causing any problems to this laptop or would it be completely safe? Would I be able to install windows 11? this is a nice investment to carry afew business apps away from my desktop and the like weight is great."
1169,"This was a replacement for my decade-old Acer notebook that was still running Windows 7, and so far I've been quite pleased--I would actually rate it closer to 4.5 stars overall."
1170,I had a chrome book and needed another laptop so I went with this one. My biggest must was I wanted one that could keep multiple tabs open without it being slow or freezing up. That’s why I loved a chrome book but this one has surprised me. I can keep multiple tabs open and it does just fine. Overall great laptop!
1171,"I have always loved this brand and for the bargain I got it for I couldn’t be more pleased with my purchase. It’s perfect for what I need it for, easily transportable, long lasting battery, quick processor, and it’s cute."
1172,"This is a basic laptop for basic tasks. At that, it's very competent, even excellent. So long as you are not expecting miracles, it gets the job done. Seems well-constructed. Very light. Small, but usable keyboard. Watch out for ads that say it has a backlit keyboard - it doesn't. That's apparently an option that is not included in the model Amazon is selling, even though the ads mention it."
1173,"As I'm sure most have experienced with low powered devices, Windows does not behave well. But these units fly on Linux. I have one unit with Win-11 dual boot on it for whenever I need to experiment with that OS. All others are Linux based. I installed this 500GB M.2 SSD (B086BGWNY8) into its open slot, to expand it's storage capacity. If it only had the ability to expand ram. Otherwise awesome!"
1174,"I was tired of lugging my gaming laptop to work, so I got this laptop. Its awesome! I mainly use it for PowerPoint presentations, but I watch streaming services as well. Good bang for the buck!"
1175,"I don’t not work from home or school from home. But needed a laptop, it does the job, no complaints as far as browsing the net or using Microsoft software. If u need a simple laptop that’s not too techy this would be the one"
1176,I bought this computer to do digital modes for ham radio. So far it is working great! It was very quick and easy to turn off S mode to be able to download the ham radio programs. Great computer at a great price!
1177,Returned. It couldn’t even load its own settings within 3 minutes. I only needed it to write in Google Docs and it couldn’t handle more than 1 tab open at a time.
1178,"For what it is, it works perfectly. I use it primarily for internet searches, email, and the occasional streaming service. It's not a powerhouse and by no means does it have alot of internal storage. But if you want a reliable laptop for basic functions, I definitely recommend it."
1179,"We bought this computer for our son to play games like Roblox or Fortenite on, but it has been lagging and taking forever to load. We thought this would be an improvement from his father's 8 year old second hand laptop that he has been using. But, it seems to be even worse. We are really disappointed."
1180,"I am giving this tablet two stars as it is inexpensive (under $200) and lightweight, other than that I would give it one star.  I should have read the description more carefully as it is not a touchscreen model.  Get your fingers to work on the touchpad if hard enough but the way this was designed if you aren't very careful you are constantly turning on the numbering feature.  It is a serious stupid design.  You have all the number above the alpha keys. Grab a calculator if you need it.  I waited too long on return it."
1181,"This does not hold a charge AT ALL!! I will plug it in and get it fully charged, then if I don't use it the next day, it will go down to no charge at all."
1182,This laptop is AMAZING I was very happy with it. It can run games like Roblox with ease and even Minecraft at low settings. I also tryed playing counter strike source and it ran very very smooth. Also this laptop is great for unity game development or game dev in general and runs very fast
1183,Absolutely love it. Ordered so I wouldn’t be tied to my desk or lug a laptop. Fits nicely in my small backpack and high quality resolution. Perfect for common everyday uses and even streams by zoom meetings without interruptions
1184,Absolutely recommend this computer.  We purchased for my 9 year old son.  It was easy to install and the battery has a good lifespan.  Love the calculator on the mouse pad feature.  Great computer for at home learning.  You can’t beat the cost.  I’m not a gamer or tech person so for the standard computer user it works great!
1185,Computer is just over one yr. I had protection on it first yr. NO alert the yr was up and so when I Turned on computer BOOM I Got hacked and Money out of pocket to fix... Now After getting yr Mcafee and running fine Today I get a NOT CONNECTED TO INTERNET Notice.  Mind you I Know There is connection as Others are online in house .. So More money out of pocket to fix another problem
1186,"My phone is much louder than this. If someone is talking, you can’t hear what you’re watching or listening to. Other than the low volume issue, it’s a great little laptop"
1187,Everything seems to be going really well:-) The setup was amazing. There’s a lady voice called Cortana directing you through the entire setup process. It sounds something like Alexa. A kid could do it. Booted up pretty fast and I’m able to work on my word and pdf docs. It’s small and compact. More convenient to carry. Will update if I come across any issues. Love it so far:-)
1188,I use this laptop to check emails and surf the web.The screen quality is very good.I does not have a touch screen.Althoug the quality is very good If you are going to play second life  you won't have enough space.
1189,"This thing should be selling for no more than $50, not no $220 and that's being generous!! Couldn't navigate Cortana though voice or keyboard, the left top side of the number pad started coming up, not worth it. I had it less than 24 before I sent it back!!"
1190,"Considering the price especially, this is a freaking steal. However, if you’re spending $200 and expecting the quality of a $1000 laptop— you’re setting your own self up for disappointment. This is a wonderful choice if you’re on a budget or just need one for the basics. It’s stores things for a few of my games, college programs and work programs. It’s fast, and well worth over the asking price imo. This is actually my new fav brand too!"
1191,"Battery is great, but hard drive is small and not sufficient for using photoshop cc which need minimum 10G and preferably 20G free, Adobe won't let you move application or even scratch file to external or flash drive. Could've used a backlit keyboard too. live and learn. I did use it to develop website and was useful to see how colors would look on less high resolution computers"
1192,It was VERY slow when I bought but I read some reviews that said the system needs to be updated and that what I did. Works like a charm now. Love it. It is small so I can carry it in my purse or just hold it. Very lightweight. It is really worth for the price.
1193,"Bought this for one of my staff who does only email, Microsoft Office, et al. Has Windows 10 Pro installed, along with Office 365. This little computer hums. Sure the screen is only 12"" - but we have it hooked to a 24"" monitor. My 79 year-old staffer is a happy camper."
1194,I've only had this laptop for about a month but its a lot better than the HP stream laptop that I got before that died after 8 months. Will definitely recommend this laptop. I wouldn't use this laptop for gaming.
1195,This is nice computer that we mainly will use for travel.  Others we have are too large to carry and go but this one works great and goes without worry on trips.  Would be fine for home usage also.
1196,"Battery life is a plus.  The antiglare screen makes it subpar for movies.  The ASUS L203MA-DS04 VivoBook is great for movies, which I also have, but battery life became poor.  I would purchase again."
1197,This is my first review I will on a product. I like the fact it is small which is easy to move around with however it sucks when using with zoom and the keyboard for the numbers always turns on by self. It’s very sensitive.
1198,I had to return because I bought as refurbished and they didn’t wipe the computer so I couldn’t login. It still had the original user’s password. The Amazon rep dropped me to a Asus rep
1199,"I updated my internet and this thing runs like a beast. I use it for simple projects, video chat, Word, email and YouTube. For $200 this laptop is a steal and I do not miss a more expensive one."
1200,I ordered a different computer by mistake first.  I had to return.  Then I got this one from Dell and live is now worth living.  It works smoothly.  The color and resolution are good.  Just what I needed.
1201,"Over all I'm happy. It serves its purpose well enough. Be sure to fully update, turn off s mode if you want to download non-microsoft applications, reboot a few times. Should run fine"
1202,"Who puts the power button on the keyboard next to the delete button, one of the most commonly used buttons for people who type all the time as their job? I've turned this thing off in the middle of my JOB like 4 times today. Jesu Cristo"
1203,"I knew it was going to be small but this laptop is tiny.. I guess I expected as much seeing how little it cost. Other than the size. It gets the job done, Google loads fast, I mostly use it for word and typing."
1204,"I needed a small laptop for general purposes when away from my pc. This more than met the bill. When I turned it on it went thru' a few gyrations required by ASUS. Once I set up the WIFI it immediately synced with my pc and transferred most, but not all, I had on the pc. I did forget it comes with the ""S"" version of Win 10, so I had to get out of that with minimal hassle. In short, as I said in m headline, it's exactly what I hoped for."
1205,"I confess I was hesitant about buying this laptop as a replacement for my old travel laptop of many years.  Yes, I read most of the reviews, watched the few available videos and, took the plunge."
1206,i'm not a big user on laptops and would very much stick to my iphone but this laptop is easy to use! it's small but easy to transport around and the number pad is useful when it needs to be. you can definitely turn off the original software but beware that you can't get it back!
1207,"This is a great computer for a hobbyist or anyone that just needs to get online, use an office suite, or watch videos. I wanted something small and light weight and ASUS nails it with the L210. You can’t beat the price and even with upgrades I did, it still cost less than anything with a similar feature set."
1208,"9/10 a great laptop for under $200. Im a college student and needed a cheap smaller laptop for when I travel since my everyday laptop is 18 inches. I couldn't buy a cromebook because its not compatible with everything I use for school. Arrived boxed well, set up was quick and the display is good. I do suggest you buy a headset or microphone because when I use zoom my professor/tutor can't hear me well, but again, this laptop is under $200 so I didn't expect perfection."
1209,It's not touch screen and the charge port doesn't work right ...alos won't stay charged would have taken more money to fix it and I'm not going through all the bull crap to ship it back when  I'm not a shipper all I want is one good product from Amazon ...sad thing is that they recommend it to me ....might as well go to a retail store and check it all yourself
1210,This has been a decent little laptop for me. Starting off in S Mode was a novel experience. At least you can do more with an S Mode Windows 10 than with a Chromebook.
1211,"I bought this lappy for my son so he can learn mobile developement, so the way it came was not useful, switched it from S mode to home edition but it took more than 80% of the SSD and installing Java ver 11 Android Studio, then Flutter allong with Dart language in the administration account it was left with very little for the non admin account."
1212,"For $200, I didn't expect much. But for a laptop to work slower than a cell phone? That's just unacceptable. When I try to use this laptop, the processor (straight out of the box) keeps running at 100%. I couldn't even open up the task manager. Also, the wireless range of this device is very limiting. I found that this laptop loses connection from my hotel bed whereas my cell phone sustained it flawlessly."
1213,"Great little machine for the price. Has space for an NVME SSD drive, which is great, but no expandable ram slots. Make sure if you're booting to Linux Mint or Ubuntu that you disable secure boot or the WiFi will NOT work."
1214,"Very convenient, light and portable with good screen quality. Durable battery life when in use but tends to drain when in shut down. I would recommend for school and probably online work as storage is small."
1215,Straight up lies to you this is false advertising it says 64 gig memory but it only has 15.7 available for me out of the box. This is horrible I can't delete anything and it says for some reason it's taking up 56.9 gigs for no reason at all. Is this a joke? I want my money back.
1216,"The touchpad is the most difficult thing to use on this device, and I had to get a mouse just to help. I use it mainly for light coding and accessing the internet. My kids have used it for Roblox. It gets the job done, but this will be a temporary device for sure. I already had issues turning it on at one point, but was able to resolve it. Just have realistic expectations from this device."
1217,I have to move between two locations with multiple floors and this laptop is so light and small that you can carry it around very easily. I use a 128Gb micro SD card for additional memory for programs other than the OS. Very quick. I had to switch from S mode to used other apps.
1218,"The picture description says BACK-LIT KEYBOARD, but it isn't! Whomever designed the website for ASUS should be fired! I went through a big hassle trying to find an ASUS laptop that actually had the back-lit keyboard that was advertised on several of their models, but didn't have it! I wound up buying an ASUS 14"" laptop that actually had the ADVERTISED back-lit keyboard from Office Depot/Office Max. I had them verify it before I bought it."
1219,"This is one of the best low-end laptops I have purchased. I needed it for work and school. It runs perfectly, is light-weight, and easily manages the tasks I run on it. The battery life is especially impressive. I often toss it in my backpack and use it throughout the day. I usually do not need to charge it for a couple days under these conditions. I also play older games on it with no problems. I am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone looking for a cheap but useful grab and go laptop."
1220,The laptop was decent at first but now the screen freezes and it blacks out. It’s always not responsive when multiple tabs are open and you can’t do much without getting other unnecessary apps.
1221,One of the main reasons I bought this was because I wanted a small laptop with a backlit keyboard.  It literally states 'backlit keyboard' on one of the image screens.  But.. just a lie.  Now I have to decide if it is worth keeping or not; prob going to send it back after I beat the shiite out of it until the last day of the return window.
1222,"This website says 64 GB but actually, I got a 57.3 GB laptop with only 25 GB free space left. Can't install my favorite apps cause they eat so much disk space."
1223,I was very excited about getting this little laptop BUT after using it for a couple of days it has been nothing but headache after headache. i’ve had to reset it multiple times and can rarely get it to actually work. I’m definitely not a computer genius or anything but I know enough to troubleshoot and fix errors pretty easily but this laptop takes frustration to a completely different level. I cannot recommend it on any level.
1224,"Ordered this laptop for my husband and he was not impressed at all.  Some of the answers claimed that there was a backlighted keyboard but not so.  The computer itself seems ok, small and lightweight but unable to download apps."
1225,Did not like this. S drive blocks you from downloading printer drivers that actually work (like direct from the Canon website). The keypad doesn't seem to work all the time. I was not pleased with this laptop.
1226,I could not be more disappointed with this laptop. Between Windows 11's criminally intrusive updates and the MyAsus service spamming me with unwanted product ads I can barely open any application. The UI is almost totally unresponsive. Hate it. Hate Asus now too. I'll be sure to avoid their products in the future
1227,"If you feel that you need the trifling advantage of the ""easy access"" NumberPad, go ahead and buy this one. If you don't, avoid this one--it's a constant annoyance. Think you can permanently disable the NumberPad? Good luck with that."
1228,"Well it really wasn't what I was looking for. It's kinda slow, and I really couldn't get too many good apps on it. And it seems much smaller than what it's size is supposed to be."
1229,Does it have to be returned in its orginal box?? cuz i got excited the first day i got it and threw the box away!! now it doesnt work anymore after six days!!!
1230,"I bought this laptop to replace a HP Stream 11.6"" that wasn't keeping up with my levels of tolerance for casual web browsing, streaming, and word processing as my daily carry laptop.  This is my third ASUS laptop and, overall, I am pretty happy with it."
1231,"I wanted an inexpensive laptop that I could dedicate to crafting projects. Unfortunately,  it is just too slow to use Cricut Design Space or even the simplest photo/graphics editing software. I read the specs, I should have known. I don't know what applications this laptop would be good for, but it is useless for my purposes. I've completely wasted my money.  Don't make the same mistake."
1232,It’s cheap for a reason. If you have any type of expectations it won’t meet them. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money on a computer you won’t wanna throw out the window after 10 min of using it
1233,"Why the laptop does good for my needs, it doesn't have a back lit keyboard like it says in the description! Other then that, it works good for doing minor things."
1234,"It’s cute, and quiet, but the screen is made in a way that you HAVE to look at it at a certain angle or it feels weird on your eyes and only the center circle is bright while the edges appear dark.  I’ve never hated a laptop screen so much. It’s almost like it has a privacy screen on it."
1235,The laptop is incredibly slow. It takes atleast twenty minute to boot up and load chrome or edge. Setup took atleast two hours by it self. I do not recommend. I can’t return it either because it’s past the return window. It doesn’t sell for much either. Awful product.
1236,"I want to like this laptop but I’m struggling. I’ve had my original Asus for 7 years and just needed something new and smaller. So I bought this. But I have some issues. When connected to HDMI for more than an hour, it just shuts itself down. It’s slow to start up and slow to run multiple windows of Google chrome. I want to use this for school work but it doesn’t seem to handle multiple word documents and chrome windows very well. I’m debating returning it."
1237,"while this review is otherwise early, i thought it worth noting that the process of upgrading from windows ""S"" security mode and installing visual studio, and an array of hardware and software development apps has gone smoothly. i was concerned about the processor meeting the minimum requirements since i had little understanding of these new variable ratings - the geekbench rating is about 16 times higher than my old toshiba ;)"
1238,"Purchased this laptop in March 2021 and it only lasted six months with light use. One day I could no longer connect to the internet. Ran the troubleshooter and it said it could not find a network adapter. Tried everything suggested, but still can't connect to the internet. Total waste of money!"
1239,"I got this laptop as a simple easy laptop to start animation, but it is incredibly slow and takes like 3 minutes just to start, it has very little storage and it crashed when working on a project and I lost 3 days of work.  I'm going to order a new laptop this week."
1240,Good deal for a computer- but man what a hassle all the PC users have just to turn on a computer. I couldnt use the thing without providing a ridiculous amount of fake personal info and restarting the machine 3X before it was finally set up 45min after I turned it on. Only reason I bought this was to run a specific app in Windows. Glad I don’t have to use these for work.
1241,"So far not a good experience. I just got it out the box and sat up and its flashing a white screen then black screen. Not loading anything, now flashing between screens and making clicking noise. I will be sending this back. Not a good buy for me"
1242,"First of all this item did not arrive in time (so it is still under the return timeframe) and I wish to return it, and also as I have tried repeatedly to access my Microsoft 365 features which are a function included with this purchase and can not do so after trying over 25 times."
1243,"Not great if you need to do just about anything. Painfully slow, you cannot add more memory. Just a trash laptop, I don’t know what I was thinking when I bought this."
1244,Numeric pad is so great.  Portability is awesome.  Always me to do basic task.  Screen size is very reasonable vs a cellphone.  Really wish there were colour options and accessories like a shell case.
1245,"I love this cheap little laptop. I installed a 256 gb microSD card to use as an additional storage drive. It fits almost flush... you will need to configure it, easy to do, see google . I also got rid of windows 10S, which limits what (non-microsoft) programs you can download....nice try Microsoft."
1246,"Brought this for a gift, it arrived just on time (used in like new condition). Opened it up get it setup and it was locked to another Microsoft user. Nothing could be done, now I have no gift and have to wait either 7 days for a replacement or 3-4 for a refund. Waste of time and money. 1/5 stars for Quality control, someone should have caught this issue before it was resold."
1247,"L210. Great little machine for what it is. Had it for about a week. Switched to Win Home and turned off/deleted a couple dozen stupid Win10 resource eaters. Turned off ""Fast Boot"" (always bad to have yesterdays mistakes reloaded, especially stupid idea for any RAM based drive). Only adds a few extra seconds to the boot. Updated to 20H2 with no issues."
1248,"I purchased this laptop and it sucks it had issue from day 1, after turning it on it works good for 20 minutes but after this the writing on the screen is distorted to the point that I cannot see anything. The issue is a manufacturing issue and Amazon refused to replace the item and they were no help at all in finding a solution I do not recommend you purchase this item it i a waste of money."
1249,I bought this computer to install a tune on my car it’s excellent for this because it’s very portable the battery lasts a long time and it downloads and uploads quickly
1250,"I bought this machine because I was looking for a small, inexpensive machine with good battery life to use for writing and media consumption when travelling, without having to worry much about it being damaged, broken or stolen."
1251,"If you know a lot about this product, I am sure you understand when I say ""I have no clue what I'm doing"". Its ok to play around and learn as you go. The user's guide is worthless, throw it away. I am sure this thing does way more than I have figured out so far, but I would probably buy it again. Tech Support is so, so. Their English is hard to understand. For the price, it's ""ok"""
1252,"Asus computers are not the fanciest, but they are durable and they work.  They get the job done and are great for travel.  For a small travel computer, one that can store some pictures, handle the internet and email, and get the basic job done, Asus is the way to go."
1253,"After many years of using actual netbooks, I was in the market for something the same shape and size after they discontinued the term. I wanted something that was somewhat future proof and wouldn't crap out after a few windows updates like all of my previous models."
1254,I got this because  we thought  our other  laptops  was dead. But wasn't  so use this and I love it.  It fast  . I don't  do gaming  so this is good for me.
1255,"My first ASUS product, and I must say the build quality is excellent! Feels substantial in your hands, not flimsy or cheap, but still lightweight and solid. Perfect. Fairly snappy and I have no complaints. By the way, thanks to LM's review on June 8, 2021 titled ""Excellent machine for price when combined with M.2 SSD"". I upgraded mine with a WD Blue SN570 500GB SSD, and man, what a difference!"
1256,Es bastante veloz para las especificaciones tecnicas que tiene de serie. La tarjeta de red responde excelente a 5ghz. Apenas es para navegar o office recordando que la pantalla es de 11 pulgadas. Aparte de la ranura de SD se puede colocar un disco nvme y aumentar considerablemente los tiempos de respuesta del almacenamiento (mmc hace bien las cosas de fabrica pero si les sobra un disco nvme vale la pena instalarlo en este PC.
1257,"Great small 'on the go' laptop.  I lost my first one, and then I ordered a second one' of this same laptop.  Good battery life and lightweight.  And it also built in blue light blocker' for eye production which i noticed worked well too."
1258,"Not sure, because I personally haven't used it yet. A family member whom I trust due to his technology expertise- feels that I won't be happy with it. I mainly ordered a cheap one for use when visiting. He was very disappointed with both the screen n sound quality. We've had an Asus before n feel it was far better overall than this one. I'm also disappointed that Amazon charged me Sales Tax, because in Oregon ""we do not pay"" sales tax on anything??"
1259,I use this for work and to stream videos and it works great for both. Long lasting battery and easy to use. I like it's compact and light. This is an excellent laptop at a great price.
1260,"Buen producto, por el precio… si quieres sacarle provecho debes comprar un m2 yq que se nota la diferencia en velocidad y almacenamiento. La calidad de la pantalla va justo igual que la cámara… pero por el precio no se puede exigir más"
1261,"Slowest computer I've ever used. I was told it could run games, that's a joke. Memory is terrible. Looks good and can do very basic stuff. Constantly needs updates that doesn't seem to do any good. Wouldn't buy it again."
1262,"So far like everything. Use it for basics. Surf, email, a few apps, stocks. Screen and cam are decent. Actually like it being in S Mode, keeps me from downloading a bunch of junk, I use an old computer for that. . ."
1263,"So far a neat little laptop. But there is a lie in the pictures. There is no back lit keyboard. Doing some research on ASUS's website, there would be a Function on F7. The F7 is just a F7 key. I totally missed the back lit keyboard question with a no answer. If at least one person has caught the false advertisement, delete the picture that indicates there is a back kit keyboard."
1264,DO NOT BUY.  I just ordered this about 4 months ago and it completely STOPPED working.  It isn't charging or turning on.  I can't tell if it's the charger or laptop that stopped working because when I plug it in to charge the light for charging doesn't light up.  I contacted Amazon and they told me to contact the manufacturer.  I called them only to be on hold for hours.  It's very frustrating.  I was going to buy a second laptop before this happened but now that won't be happening.  DO NOT BUY.
1265,"Absolute the slowest piece of trash computer I have every used. And I have been using/ repairing computers from decades ago, DOS, WIN 3.11, IBM OS 2 WARP, DX 350 Full Tower, A, B drives."
1266,"The ASUS Laptop L210 Ultra Thin Laptop, 11.6” HD Display, Intel Celeron N4020 Processor is lightweight and fast, including a fast connection to the existing WiFi connection. However, this model was advertised on Amazon with a keyboard that is supposed to be backlighted. The model I received does not include that feature which is quite disappointing. Items should not include feature documentation for features not included with the item listed."
1267,"If you want to do more advanced stuff, it's probably not the best. Default storage size is really low, but the  upside is that it includes an M.2 NVME drive bay so it can easily be expanded for more storage."
1268,Did not work at all. Was frozen. Have to send to company.  Cost was $40.00 to me. Company says turn around is slow because of COVID. Would certainly not recommend.
1269,"I brought this laptop for my 11 years old so he can access Google classroom to complete his homework, the laptop works ok for a week then start freezing touch don't work like they suppose to,I understand the laptop is cheap and everything but at least it could have work for a bit more time 🙄"
1270,"I'm giving this little engine that could five stars. Why? Well, it's two hundred dollars. So I'm reviewing it as a two hundred dollar product. If I was comparing it to a Macbook Air M1, it would probably be three stars. If I was comparing it to a Microsoft Surface, three and a half. But it's a small, budget laptop, and in that category, it's excellent."
1271,"I bought this because I got tired of battling with various websites I need that are not properly designed for iOS mobile devices. It is a very basic machine that does basic stuff for a really good price. I added Microsoft Office and Kaspersky anti-virus (which doesn’t use a lot of memory), and I have everything I need."
1272,"I bought this laptop to use for leisure travel this next year.  Wanted something bigger and more useful than the tablet I currently have.  While I have just started the setup process, ie loading my apps, files, etc., it is doing exactly what I wanted it to do.  I've switched to Windows Home, installed all my apps and it's currently updating Windows.  It is showing lots of promise!"
1273,"Although Asus is a good little laptop at a good price, they have ruined the touchpad by adding a 10 key number pad on it. It turns on with just a brush if finger and there is no way to disconnect it."
1274,I dislike that after I did transfer date from a usb after I can not remove complete and also continue to appear fotos on my desktop. Not Good also I did take a selfie or My laptop then I can not change. Not good. Etc Etc.
1275,"Needed a windows computer to run trading software. Inexpensive but for doing the basics it's of great value. It's not a high end computer but for internet surfing, watching YouTube videos, and running a very taxing CPU program for trading; it does just fine. I'd recommend over a chromebook also."
1276,"It's a minimal computer as the price should state. But it's what I needed. Small, lightweight and in great condition. I had an older model where the internet card died and it is easier to buy an updated model that try use work around."
1277,"Lo único que no me gustó es qué el paquete de oficina estaba caducado y me decía que tenía 1 año gratis, después todo está excelente y el tamaño es muy práctico"
1278,"I bought the 11.6"" 64GB HDD model. Don't need much space/speed as I'm just surfing the web and posting on forums etc. No biggie. Nice keyboard. Screen is big enough. Super light. Quiet. Long battery life. All good!"
1279,It very tiny which was a surprise. I had to get used to scrolling instead of a mouse because my wireless mouse would not connect to it. The picture quality is great and it connects to internet quickly.  I don't use a computer much but I'm happy with it. It fits my needs.
1280,"I purchased this laptop to use as a spare machine in my consulting practice, and also for use with my ham radio hobby. When I saw the specs on this laptop, followed by the price, I couldn't help but order one. My key requirements were size, weight, and a decent screen. This little machine fits all of those requirements in spades."
1281,Never had a chance to try it out because the screen was broken initially. I’m  very upset because I purchased it to travel tomorrow to Hawaii so I’d have a pc.  now I have no laptop. Bummed!!!
1282,"Toons a couple weeks to get, the seller took his time mailing it out. Computer is very very small. Works ok that I’ve seen but honestly I think I’m going to send it back."
1283,I bought t high is laptop to write letters and longer articles on. I am very pleased that it has the capacity to stream sports events. It is a great bargain for the price
1284,"I really liked this little machine and for the price, in my opinion is a steal.  It is  like 20% faster than my mini PC which sports an Intel Celeron N3450 Quad-core.  Per my tests with the 64GB eMMC included, even Windows 10 (v2004) is snappy.  I also ran Linux on it with no issues, except that the wireless driver needs to be installed manually(tested on Mx Linux for instance).  The sequential reading for the Sandisk eMMC is 316 MB/s and 154 MB/s writing."
1285,I'm happy with the laptop and my son needed it for his college and it's not his first laptop so i did ask him if he was able to use it for whatever he has to do and i was content to hear him say it was.😌😊 His personal laptop stopped working and until his finance is better for him to be able to get a much better and bigger one i got him it.
1286,I ordered this for my daughters birthday. She was super excited when she opened it however that didn't last long. We couldn't even download a search engine. Didn't seem like it was refurbished at all. Now my refund has been issued less a $75.00 restocking fee. I actually was charged a restocking fee for a product that didn't even work. I could understand if it was for some other reason but this is just ridiculous.  Will never order from this seller again.
1287,I only needed the computer for zoom.  Whenever I touched the mic I had to hit it several times to turn on mic to speak.  It was a pain so I returned the computer.  I prefer touch screen & a larger screen.
1288,Its a cheap nonchromebook laptop so you get what you'd expect. An issue though is the touchpad randomly registers a click and hold with the touchpad so a lot of times when you switch tabs it'll separate the current tab and make another open browser. I'm stuck with that issue since i'm using a usb mouse that for this laptop only seems to stutter across the screen and lag
1289,"This is a well built solid low end laptop.  You should not expect much power from this system.  However for web browsing, watching streaming services (like Youtube, Hulu, Amazon), and basic office tasks like word processing, Quickbooks, etc this laptop works without issue."
1290,"One of the biggest appeals of this laptop for me was the product description promising a YEAR trial of Microsoft Office 365. I buy it, and at startup of the laptop it only offers a month trial. I try calling Asus support to ask about this and cannot reach anyone. Ripoff."
1291,"For what this is supposed to be and for roughly $200, it's fantastic. This isn't a high performance gaming laptop (or really any kind of gaming laptop) and it would be difficult to do precise graphic design work. However, for internet access and word processing and all of your everyday computer uses, it's one of the best you can get."
1292,This is the worst laptop I have bought in my life. It comes with low storage from the start which slows the processing down by a huge margin. DO NOT purchase this product since it has no practical applications!
1293,"Nice little computer, great for simple tasks. I recently became self-employed in business development. I look at a lot of webpages but don’t run any software really, and still already low on memory and from what I understand, none can be added. Waste of money I think…"
1294,"The compact size makes it easy to keep up my writing practice. Just grab it and start, no big deal! I only use it for word processing and research so screen quality is fine. The size makes it for me, though."
1295,"You might think that only 4 gb for a Windows 10 laptop that cant expand the ram is a bad idea... Well, I've found this small laptop is actually fine, even quick for internet browsing, email, word processing and watching videos.  Sure, the keyboard is smaller, but even with large hands, I had no trouble typing..."
1296,"Works perfect with Linux Mint Xfce 20.1. Only problem is the WIFI card, it recognizes the driver but can't install cause it's not connected to the internet.... Can't install the driver thus can't connect to the internet thus can't install driver, vicious cycle. With no Ethernet port then you're stuck :( had no option but to open it up and replace the WIFI card with an Intel one from and almost EOL Chromebook. After all that headache it works flawless!"
1297,"For the price of this an amazing buy you can do alot of things with this alot of cool features i really wish there was a button to disable the keyboard to be able to clean the keys easier but it is an amazing laptop still i highly suggest anyone looking for a cheap laptop whether it is gaming,using the internet browser or just overall file using!!"
1298,"I ended up returning this, I got it to replace my 4 year old laptop that died on me. When it came in the mail and I set it up, it ran so slowly! My old computer didn't even run that slowly before it died."
1299,"Bought this to watch youtube on that wasn't my big gaming computer, it works wonderfully for that. I have not tried to play games on it. but I must warn that the CPU is not very strong and when you first start it up it will be slow while it's trying to update windows. after that, it will be fine. I also recommend uninstalling what little bloatware comes with it."
1300,"It arrived right on time. I'd bought one before for my school and it works well. I bought a second one, and it arrived with someone's pin already set it in. I can't tell you how disappointed I am in ASUS, especially when I was planning to buy more of these. Great price, but representing something as new and selling me a used computer is pretty low!"
1301,"It is a really good laptop if you want the basic stuff, works erfect for my, screen is terrible it just does the job, do not spect high quality screen in here, Good battery life, fast boot, nice design. There is a miatake on the desceiption, KEYBOARD DOES NOT LIGHT UP"
1302,"Battery life is pretty awesome, I'm horrible about shutting down my pc but with just closing the screen it has a stand by life of days. Light enough to carry in my purse, small enough to be able to every day. This was bought for light use but had been pressed into business use occasionally. The screen is crisp and vibrant. Easy to use and set up. I'm very happy with my purchase."
1303,This ASUS I was never able to use because I did not have the prior user's password.  A  refurbished Computer  is to be restored to original use.  This Was NOT!!!
1304,"I ordered this laptop for work purposes, and because I needed a new laptop. It definitely gets the job done. It's a cute little laptop and has been working perfectly so far. It isn't touch screen which is a bummer because, in the reviews, it said it was. Other than that, I like the laptop overall."
1305,How garbage. I wouldn't even buy this for $50.00 if I was able to try it first!! I should have just been patient and bought a better laptop... As far as the actual delivery of the product it was perfect. But this laptop is a pure cash grab with gimmicks.
1306,"This worked great for a few days. Then, it just died. Do not buy. I'm telling you: I used it maybe 3 or 4 times, doing nothing more than email, etc. Didn't go to any new sites, or download anything questionable. But it gave me an error message and then just died. No light on the power button. Nothing."
1307,This definitely did not meet my expectation. I ordered it after reading excellent reviews. Unfortunately this pc sucks. It doesn't let me do anything. It takes forever to load and is really slow. Now I can't even return it!! Total waste of money!
1308,"I wanted this laptop to do only one thing - act as the control for a label printer, but it couldn't even do that. It took forever to boot, and everyday tasks kept crashing it. Totally useless! I returned it as soon as I could get it to shutdown."
1309,"Help from ASUS is impossible, had problems activating Microsoft and they had no idea what they are doing and there phone system was so bad that calls kept dropping took twelve hours being on hold and dropped calls and constantly reidentifying myself"
1310,"I had this product for a little over two months with no issues, I just went to open it in class and it’s was completely unresponsive with a white screen and no apparent way to fix it. It seemed like a decent lap top but apparently not."
1311,"Absolute piece of garbage. Fired it up the first time to use it, did all the of required updates, and its already bogged down and running terribly. The 6 year old laptop I had bought this one to replace due to terrible performance is out-performing this laptop. Complete waste of money."
1312,"According to the seller Holiday-express, it is no longer made with an sd card slot as of 2022. Still shows one in the pictures on the listing and asus website July 2022. If you wanted the SD for storage you won’t get it"
1313,"The seller lies when advertises that it has backlit keyboard. It says it 3 times, at least, in the product site. IT IS A LIE, and i felt ripped off."
1314,I love the smaller size of this and that it has choice of 10-key number pad. The speakers are lousy so just get a bluetooth speaker or ear buds! Great for kids in school!
1315,I found this product very functional and good value for the money once I purchased and inserted a 128 micro SD card. It does not have a touch screen and probably would not be good for gaming as it is not designed for that.
1316,"Battery is fully charged before shut down. When turned on next day, it is at 60% charge.  Does not hold a charge at all. Reviews show that this is a common issue."
1317,"Its a great casual laptop that is silent and can run what is needed for my college classes.  Does not possess a backlit keyboard which was a little misleading and disappointing, but not really a deal breaker.  For the price I paid ($190 for the n4020 11.6 model) I am very satisfied."
1318,I wish it had more processor capabilities. I got it for checking email and of course now I want to do more browsing and sometimes it is capable and other times not.
1319,"Advertises backlit keyboard. Does not have one. I had the first replaced, but same issue. If you want a touch screen, or backlit keyboard forget about this model. False advertising in that respect."
1320,"If you loved the portability and battery life with your chromebook but missed some features of Windows, this is perfect.  I took mine out of S mode (prompted to do so when downloading 3rd party software).  It runs spreadsheets, word processors, and anti-virus software with no issues.  Video streaming, web surfing, email, Roblox with kids, no problem.  Goes all day without a charge.  Smaller than an 8x11 sheet of paper. Fires up as fast as a chromebook. Keyboard works great.  In love with this machine!"
1321,I purchased this laptop  because we were going to be traveling abroad and I wanted something light. I just began using it somewhat routinely about two weeks ago. Then…the screen went blank. I have checked everything but nothing seems to work. There is a small white light on the side - which makes me think there is power but cannot get it to show anything else. Trying to get in touch with the manufacturer but no response.  POOR QUALITY
1322,The Celeron processor must be from 10 years ago! This is the slowest computer I have seen in many moons!  don't waste the money and get something worth buying..this boat anchor is obsolete already!  Celeron 1  is what it is! says up to 2.8 Mhz? bull!
1323,"I really love this laptop! It's decently powerful and very fast. I wanted something light like a Chromebook, but ran a decent os. This one's great! Does all I need and runs left 4 dead pretty good, so it's great for college and work! As for touch screen, it doesn't have one, which is a weird feature to bring up. Battery life is good too, and the screen is very good for the size."
1324,Took out of box started set up and 5 minutes in it froze up so sent it back and Amazon sent a replacement and received in 3 days took it out of box started setup and 5 minutes in froze up again.  Will be returning this one also.  I'd stay away from this one!
1325,Very disappointed.  Product didn't work.  Contacted support and they tried to help but couldn't.  I returned the broken one and I am still waiting for the replacement.  It's been delayed twice.  I am not happy with this 😕😒
1326,"I am happy with this laptop because I can work my engineering excel sheets, manage my email, read my ebooks, listen music and watch streaming videos. It is very portable and lightweight. Office 365 licence was free for 1 year. I replace my pc for this laptop.  I dont use it for play games. I upgraded free Win 10 S for Win 10 home and it runs faster. This is a very good laptop with good quality - price relationship."
1327,"This laptop has an 11.6 inch screen, which is kind of small, but I absolutely love it. It's light and easy to carry. Absolutely the best laptop I've owned in years."
1328,"Product description very much lied about the keyboard being backlit. Pretty pissed about that considering it the reason I chose this laptop over others I was looking at. Otherwise, it works fine for the basic little wprd processor I use it for. Also, not a cool design like any online description of the model. This one is straight flat black. Incredibly plain-looking. And one of my keys is at a wonky angle, but it works. Considering the ither asus products I own, this one falls short, honestly."
1329,"It works great for what I need it for- it's hella basic. Not digging the calculator on the touch pad, thought it would be cool but I keep accidentally turning it on and that's kind of annoying."
1330,The sound is horrible lots of static the picture not good all I wanted to do is do zoom an the quilts is horrible people can never hear me. Did not start using my laptop until a month after I received it but it was to late to send called the company they had me to reset it and it’s still no better I am so disappointed with this product
1331,My wife bought this for email and Facebook essentially. I had to uninstall the Windows 10S features because it kept freezing on the screen that said only approved windows 10 S apps would work.This warning came up randomly even though the only apps on the laptop WERE from the Microsoft App store.Finally I said ok no more Windows 10S and dropped it in favor of plain Windows 10. Since that time there has been no problem and no discernible detriment to the function. It is very small so be advised if this is a concern.
1332,I bought this on a whim.  It's basically a Chromebook with an unlocked boot loader.  Identical specs to the Chromebook my kid uses for school.  I am pleasantly surprised by the performance and versatility.  I have it dual booting Windows 10 and Ubuntu Linux.  I opted to take Windows out of S mode.  I also opted to leave Win 10 on the 64GB eMMC drive and install Ubuntu on a Crucial P5 500GB NVME SSD.
1333,"I ordered this small laptop for work purposes and general office operations.  So far, it's been well worth the money.  I took it out of Windows S mode.  It struggled (lagged) a bit with Chrome, so I resorted to using the Microsoft Internet browser but it's been fine.  And since I only use it for work (general office stuff), it's done everything that I could have asked....thus far!"
1334,"The cursor didn't work. When I watched YT videos I moved the cursor over the gear icon to improve the picture quality, not clicking on the icon, just moving the cursor over it. This made the video suddenly jump halfway to the end, then back to the one third mark, then forward to the two thirds mark. It wasn't working properly. The screen brightness control didn't work, either. It was stuck on full brightness, which was irritating."
1335,"I bought this for a small portable Pentest system. I installed Kali on the system getting rid of Windows 11. All hardware in the system wifi, network and touch pad work out of the box with Kali. Solid feel for a plastic case. Added a 500G NVMe PCIe M.2 SSD without issue."
1336,I have to honestly question where all the terrific reviews come from. The laptop looks and feels like a toy laptop you would buy for a 7 yro. Cheap materials - the shell made out of flimsy plastic. Very low quality display. The keyboard action was also unimpressive - surprising considering there are so many v. inexpensive high quality keyboards on the market. I would never buy ASUS again.
1337,This laptop has crashed 3 times since I have received it and now it can't find my network. The network I was on. I'm trying to conduct a small business with this. I'm going to go out of business messing with this ish... It says it has a touch screen. I guess I don't have the magic touch because it's not working.
1338,The only thing that really shocked me was it is not as big as other laptops. It is small. People please aware of what actual size laptop you think you are purchasing.
1339,Not terrible for a cheap laptop but I’ve had mine for a year and a couple months and the touch pad already stopped working. This isn’t a laptop I use a ton so I expected it to last a little longer before I started having problems.
1340,"Overall nice little laptop with good graphics, nice keypad, and touchpad, but the description says it comes with a backlit keyboard and it does not.  Very difficult to use this laptop without a light due to all black keyboard and limited space for palms.  Battery life is pretty long (11+ hours) and the screen is nice and crisp.  Easy to take out of S Mode if you prefer Chrome or other downloads that are not part of the Microsoft store.  Fast processing for cheaper model."
1341,"This little laptop has saved me throughout my semester at college and it is just so handy. It is very snappy and can easily be booted up to Chrome from being powered down in about 20 seconds. The only problem I have with it is the very low 64gb of SD storage. When you first receive it, the system already takes up about 10gb of this so you are only left with around 54gb for everything you’re doing. This isn’t much of a problem if you only use it for web browsing and homework assignments but still."
1342,"Daughter uses it to play Club Penguin. Works well for that. Small, light. She has no problem carrying it around or laying in bed with it. She keeps turning on the numeric pad, which messes with the mouse."
1343,"I purchased this cheap computer for a computer class this semester and I have mixed feelings. It's small, super cheap and the battery life is very good which I love but I have 2 major complaints."
1344,"The laptop is just a described with two exception,  they should remove the part about backlit keyboard cause it don't have and that's false advertising as I was hoping it did. The battery life was around 5hrs with light use. There is also the issue of limited app installation when out of S mode because of the single channel processor. I found that there were slight delays at times in processing with just a web browser open."
1345,"Nice buy, especially for the price. I was looking for a relatively cheap laptop to replace my old one that I had had for 6, almost 7 years. It works well and I’ve had no issues so far. I thought the 180 folding feature the screen has was silly at first, but honestly it’s come in handy more times than I thought it would lol I’d recommend for anyone looking for a cheap or size/space friendly laptop. MUCH smaller than my old one though, the keyboard difference took some getting used to. But overall a good purchase!"
1346,It's been more than a month since I got mine and about 3 weeks in the touch pad stopped working. Trying getting it fixed by a technician who wants an arm and a leg to fix it. I'm not a fan of using a mouse so disappointment is an understatement at this stage.
1347,The touch pad on this laptop was terrible! Many times it would type a line of letters or characters without my touching the pad. Sometimes ifmy hand got close to the pad it would change screens and I would have an awful time getting back to the screen.  Most of the time I would have to go back to the beginning and start over.  It was also verrry sloooow.  I am very disappointed with the product.
1348,"This is a nice little laptop. I didn't realize it was this small when I originally ordered it but I didn't look at the specs either. It was a good deal so I ordered it. The laptop is an 11.6"" but to be a small laptop, it's a good one. It has a great battery life too."
1349,"buena relacion calidad precio, en general se comporta bien, buena velocidad de respuesta, la utilizo para funciones basicas y trabajo. no le pide nada a un aparato caro. En verdad si la compras no te arrepentiras."
1350,"It took about ten minutes to download Google Chrome, and when it did, simply opening a new tab on the app took at least two minutes for it to fully load. I bought this laptop to use for writing and schoolwork, but the speed was just unbearable."
1351,"It is a cute little computer, but parts of it did not work after a month or so.  This is the 2nd Asus product I have bought, and it will be my last.  When it would not work for the things my child needed, I thought I may trade it in to get another.  Best Buy did not see it as having any value although we only had it for 4 months.  Crazy! The other ASUS messed up as well in a few months.  Other than for fun, I wouldn't purchase this."
1352,"very nice for simple things. every few days it ask for restart.. it does what i need it to. windows is nice.. email set up nice.. Again for simple things emails keep track of writing, maybe if you need a online shopping .. maybe certain things a person might not want to do their phone.."
1353,"I bought this for use with my Samsung smart TV, not expecting much more than consistent and trouble free Internet access with reasonable speed. The first thing I did was to switch from Windows 10-S to to regular Windows 10 (Home) and uninstall apps that were not relevant to my usage. I also downloaded a few apps. I was surprised to find that it is quite a nice little netbook for routine computer tasks and excellent for travel: very compact, light, pretty decent screen, lovely clean design, excellent keyboard."
1354,"Honestly, it works amazing! The only problem I have is the storage and the touchpad really. The people who say that it’s too slow are probably just fake reviews to be honest. It loads pretty slow for the first 2 hours but then after the updates are done, its a pretty fast load-up time. So far, I’ve played Minecraft (with resolution down), and it worked great!"
1355,Touch pad and mouse and keyboard all reacts slow to input... sort of like it keeps having to process the input before it can react to it.  I know it is a cheaper computer but it should not be slow to a mouse click.
1356,Was working fine although we didn't really use it that much...then the screen went black & nothing. Plugged it into multiple outlets to see if that was the issue but nada. We bought in May 2021 & it's only October 2021. DON'T BUY!
1357,Computer does not turn on with one push of the on button. Sometimes it takes 20 pushes. This problem occurred after 30 days once the return policy expired . My loss. I am buying another computer.  Stay away from this computer. Don't BUY!!!
1358,There should have been return labels. I didn't even have a phone number or an email address to contact the seller. It worked for a week and then wouldn't even come on after that. I had to buy ANOTHER computer from Walmart. I WANT MY MONEY BACK NOW!!!
1359,"This laptop can be a perfect option for everyone who is looking for a powerful laptop but at the same time light weighted to be easy to carry. The laptop has a simple and chic packaging, the sizing is perfect, not so big and not small. It’s very powerful especially compared to some gaming laptops with thousands of dollars price. I absolutely love how thin it is so I can easily carry it everywhere."
1360,"I ordered this for selling items online.  I have a couple sites that I sell homemade items on.  This laptop is slow, and doesn't seem to have the capability to handle some things as well as a higher end laptop would.  I ordered this, thinking it was like a normal laptop, but its not. Its much more restricted.  If you are looking for a laptop for a senior citizen or a young teen, this is a good one to get, but if you want to do certain things on it, you might look for something with more capability."
1361,"I don't understand as to how in 2022 laptops like this are still being sold. Even for simple web browsing, it's very laggy and freezes often, how are we still using this processor? It's awful and it heats up tremendously while doing simple tasks. I don't see how anyone other than seniors who need a computer for personal needs can use this, while even for them it might be hard because of the lack of power the processor has."
1362,"Really good purchase. I was a little unsure at first with it being on Amazon, but this little thing is great. It's good for people who mainly do school and writing like me. Also good for gaming. 10/10!"
1363,"For light weight yes does it do most school applications yes. Grade 1st, 2nd,3rd,4th 5th yes,,, light business application yes now the mouse pad is disappointing it’s  functioning ok you have to teach your self it’s not functioning as the more expensive lap tops  it’s ok for the beginner"
1364,"These type of computers don’t make much sense to me, they are literally only meant to have a usable life of about 1 year for the 64gig and about 2 years for the 128gig. The reason this is, is because the storage is soldered to the motherboard. To give you an example, this is like buying a car with a full tank of gas at a low price but the gas tank being sealed to where you couldn’t add no more gas. I’ll explain in more detail why they have a short use life and why this laptop has potential."
1365,"it went black. dont turn on. ik its good brand, and easier to sit anywhere. all issues I have had with laptops. save your headaches and buy desktop. I'm going seek refund"
1366,"I purchased this laptop, then returned it for the same thinking the first was damaged. The second had the same audio issue during teleconference meetings. I called Ausus for tech support and they alluded that every platform I use was the problem versus the laptop. I have a smaller Asus laptop that I'm currently using and have no issues using it on all the platforms, it's just small and inconvenient to work using it all day."
1367,Biggest waste of money ever! Straight out of the box it's SLOW! I uploaded some photos and they won't even load. I can't even open up the Internet without it taking 5 minutes to load with no additional programs downloaded. Don't make my mistake. This thing belongs in the garbage. My first gateway computer in 1995 was faster than this!
1368,"I got this laptop to watch Youtube videos. That is all I got it for.  This laptop had an issue playing the videos. The Celeron processor could not handle it.  The video would stop.  Sometimes the video would stop and the audio would continue.  Overall, just a frustrating experience.  I am returning the laptop. I am getting a laptop with a better, faster processor."
1369,"This is a nice basic computer. It's not good for gaming or graphic design, but it would be great for a student who needs basic word processing, Internet, streaming, and maybe some low graphic games. It's got very basic components, but it's nicely built and lightweight.  It has a nice, sharp screen for watching movies or doing homework.  I would recommend it for someone who doesn't have advance computing needs."
1370,I’m not sure if this is for gaming but I use it for school and it works well. Light weight and love the updated features. Had an asus before and this is a great brand.
1371,"I bought this to be my ""printer and light work"" laptop since I can't use my work laptop with non-company printers (I work remotely).  I learned very quickly that 4GB of RAM will NOT get anything done that you need.  I saw it had a USB-C connection, one of the main factors of the purchase, but learned it does not have DP over USB-C capabilities.  I can't hook it up to my work station, nor can do anything with the 4GB of RAM.  So I returned it."
1372,"I got this during Prime Days, so it wasn’t very expensive. I wasn’t expecting much, but it has exceeded my expectations. It works great and it does exactly what I need it to do."
1373,"I have had this same laptop (although in Windows 10) and I've loved its ease of use.  However, after spilling hot tea on it, it was fried..  So, I a ordered a new one (but with Windows 11)."
1374,"Only one complaint so far but other than that it's 5 stars across the board. The complaint is I just got it, installed 1 app (steam) and the laptop already sounds like a airplane taking off. It settled down a bit but I can hear air flowing so it's not quiet. I haven't tested it even with game to see if it can run games well enough to play so I think it will serve my purpose to full decent games on low."
1375,"It is a decent machine. The only thing that keeps it from being a very good machine is the highly annoying fact that it restarts itself, without any warning, once or twice a day. I can get no help from Acer, or Microsoft about this issue. Acer suggested that it was a Windows issue, but were no help in resolving it. Microsoft simply won't answer my requests for help."
1376,"Do not buy this laptop if you want to add two external monitors. This computer does not connect to any docking stations I have (which I use for various other computers. The USB-C port is of no use. This computer has been nothing but a hassle for me. I bought it because of the price, but have had to buy a number of adapters to get it to work with my monitors. I may have to return this laptop."
1377,"It has a plug for my external monitor, a plug for ext. speakers, a USB c for my DVD drive, USB for my ext. keyboard & mouse and two other USB plugs and Windows 11."
1378,"I've had it for about 2 months & it does the job as far as what a computer should do. The sound is very low, static filled & just overall sound bad. I haven't had the camera freeze I was experiencing in the beginning as often but it still shouldn't happen. The speed & connectivity is good so far. I would've invested a little more into something that sounds much better but at the time I needed the comp I didn't have the extra $."
1379,I used an Acer laptop all during college and for years after.  So when I needed a new computer I instantly wanted to go back to the Acer brand.  From day 1 this laptop was awful quality.  It keeps restarting randomly and I lost important work and got disconnected from several Zoom meetings.
1380,This is the fastest loading computer I've experienced.  It's quiet and the backlit keyboard really helps because my den is rather dark and that's where I use the computer daily.
1381,"Everything is good, but the screen is glary and the buyer needs is required to use or create Microsoft office account to login for first-time use. Not a touch screen, just a clear reminder."
1382,"First laptop I've ever had with the speakers on the bottom. Yupp, you read that right, the bottom. Makes the sound very dull and muted. Would love a touch screen or atleast the screen to be edge to edge and without the thick black edges. Boo. Key board is great and the computer is lightning fast. Not great for games tho, but school and movies it will do fine with."
1383,This laptop has fantastic reviews. I researched thoroughly before choosing one and was so happy to receive this. The first few days were fine. I use it for my school work and to play The Sims 4. I have an endless amount of CC and Mods and the laptop speed did not slow.
1384,"This rating is not based on Acer's quality which I really think is very good.  This computer is almost identical to my other one, differs only in that hard drive is smaller and it has Windows 11 instead of Windows 10.  And therein lies the problem.  This computer's performance is noticeably slower than my almost identical WIndows 10 machine. From what I have read ""Windows 11 is optimized for Intel's new processors"".  It really shows.  I am considering installing 10 on this one."
1385,I have always had an acer laptop. Upgraded through the years. I bought this laptop in July. I started a small business and started working from home. I’ve had more problems with this thing than I can count! The internet quit connecting. My son installed the new driver in it. Worked one time. We’ve had to install a new driver multiple times to get this laptop to work. I’m now having to purchase a different laptop and hope it doesn’t happen with a new one. Very disappointed and will not purchase an Acer again!
1386,"Pésima computadora.  Tengo 2 hijas y para sus clases compré 2 en total.  Nunca he tenido problemas con compras de computadoras hasta ahora.  Soy ingeniero electrónico, así que sé muy bien de lo que estoy hablando y definitivamente las dos computadoras tienen problemas.  Son 2 fallas que detecto:"
1387,"Bought this computer when my Lenovo Yoga 2 (which was 8 years old) suddenly died on me.  I don't do much heavy lifting with my computer, mostly just Microsoft Office and web browsing so I figured this computer would meet my needs.  Unfortunately, there are a couple of things I can't look past."
1388,"Very nice  price quality, it is not sooooo Good, but it works very well for the price i recomendado for my friends .muy buena relación precio calidad,no es la octava maravilla pero por el precio esta bien,la recomiendo ampliamente a mis amigos"
1389,I’m not a gamer but this laptop does allow me to work efficiently. I’m a realtor and work mostly from home. I don’t download games or pictures to my laptop.  I deal with several different websites for work. We do a lot of documents and photos with Dropbox. The laptop is small and perfect for travel. I work long hours so it stays charged about 7 hrs. Good enough for my work and $500 worth the price. Would recommend this laptop and purchase again.
1390,You will not go wrong w this device. Add an 8gig ddr4 sodimm 2400mhz yourself to it and youre good to go. Back lid opens easily. And do remove Windows S. It doesnt fly and isnt for gaming but will do everything else quite well.
1391,The screen quality is really good. I don't use my machine for gaming so I won't know. But I like the back light on the keyboard. I haven't used it on battery yet
1392,"Not very computer savvy, so I was somewhat hesitant to buy it, but I already owned an Acer desktop and loved it  so I went with Acer again for a laptop. Very easy to set up and use. 15” screen is good too. Overall, very happy!"
1393,"I've been on hold for an hour and a half from their customer ignore number. these people don't help you, they actually ghost you. there is no support for anything as far as i can tell, since they ignoring me without even knowing my question. i think you better talk in chinese to get help, because there is no american help. i am sending an Acer computer back for the second time in a month because they can't support their feeble product. i cant do this again, i do not want an ascer."
1394,"I picked this particular laptop for my new one because it is supposed to have a backlit keyboard. I had an Acer before and it was a good computer. I work at lot at night in poor light so a backlit keyboard would be a  really good feature. But, unfortunately, the back light does not work at all. I looked up instructions and they don't work."
1395,"Although I’m more than proficient in computer use I’m not extremely tech savvy when it comes to computer specs, so this review won’t be about those. This review is about my experience with this laptop as an everyday laptop user."
1396,"I'm an engineer who has been using company-provided laptops, bought to my spec, for many years.  This time I was spending my own money, to buy one for my daughter for school, so I wanted a solid school-appropriate laptop that wasn't some crippleware nightmare.  This really fits the bill."
1397,"We got this for general use (surfing, movies, games, music, etc.) and overall it's a nice laptop and works well for our purposes. Setup took some time with updates and setting up options but it was simple and walked you through it step by step."
1398,"I can't believe the quality and performance to price ratio here. These are my go to for cheap laptops for clients who have employees that need to access online applications, email, web and other SaaS instances. They are fast, and have held their speed great. Even with a $99 upgrade to Windows Pro its hard to find a better deal for the quality and hardware."
1399,"I don't know who designed to install the speakers underneath the laptop, but that was beyond stupid. The sound quality is horrible, especially if you don't have it sitting on an elevated surface. Other than that I'm happy with it, but if you plan to listen to a lot of music without a headset, look elsewhere."
1400,"I have been searching for a good quality laptop, and this is my first foray back into a windows laptop. First off, this thing is big, it had a beautiful 1080 HD screen, back-lit keyboard and just feels like a super solid build."
1401,"A laptop that is suited for basic tasks like online browsing, remote meetings, work activities, social networking , watching videos and occasional gaming because of the Ryzen processor with the Radeon graphics card along with the high speed Wi-Fi 6 which provide quick response and fast and reliable internet connectivity. The 8 GB of memory and 256 GB SSD can be expanded and included with the laptop is a kit to add an additional 2 1/2 inch SSD or hard drive."
1402,"after a month of using this laptop and was initially satisfied, i received the blue screen of death. ive tried running the recovery and diagnostics to figure out what was the issue. being inclined on computers i tested everything and even tried reinstalling windows. still, i continued to get the BSOD. eventually i found out that either the gpu or psu was going out. i guess you get what you paid for."
1403,"My daughter has been very into playing The Sims and that is what we bought this for. It works perfectly. It’s nice and big and we had no problems downloading the game and expansion packs, which I was a little nervous about."
1404,"Buena relacion precio calidad, si lo que buscas es un portatil para trabajar con programas multimedia relativamente exigentes y quizas jugar algun que otro juego esta es tu mejor opcion"
1405,"I give it 5 stars because I can't imagine getting better bang for the buck. This is a $400 laptop that punches like a $1500 laptop, which is what it replaced. I am a dad, not a gamer, so I use it for dad stuff. Office 365, MS Teams, WebEx, Zoom, YouTube, Spotify, relatively low impact stuff.  I don't need a CPU/GPU/RAM that make your toes curl. I need simple, functional and reliable, and that's what I got for *#@$&? $400. Heck yes."
1406,"First off, this laptop works great in general. It features a very nice crisp IPS 1080p screen, has a slightly glossy screen, full size keyboard, is lightweight, thin, and fast --- and comes with a backlit keyboard."
1407,"I have no idea why they designed this thing with an offset trackpad, but it contributes to multiple clicks because the ""left click"" area of the pad is now juuuuuust out of reach, to the point I have to be cognizant of where my hand is every god damn time and it just breaks any kind of flow. Regret not returning this during the return window because if randomly freezes and requires too many reboots for a new laptop. I guess you get what you pay for with this one."
1408,"The keyboard is easy to see - in daylight. I specifically ordered one with a backlit keyboard thinking they all stay on, like my wife's. This one goes off after 30  seconds, leaving the keyboard dark. For me that is a problem. I'm 73, have very bad vision in one eye and floaters in the other. It breaks up my concentration when I'm writing. The light goes on with a slight touch, but it's distracting."
1409,"This is a great laptop for it's price. Needed a laptop for an employee to use on-site and picked this one out. Very fast, light weight, and perfect size for our needs. No complaints here!"
1410,"I received the laptop 3 weeks ago and have not had any problems.  Being more of a power user, I bought a 16gb stick of Acer DDR4 3200 RAM from Amazon and couldn’t be happier.  The 6 core processor is a screamer!  And I love the metal lid.  It looks awesome."
1411,...but I absolutely DESPISE Windows 11 and this laptop came with it already installed. I waste so much time tracking down documents I've downloaded and nothing about 11 is at all intuitive or logical. I don't appreciate my time when working being wasted on dumb stuff and Windows 11 can pretty much be summed up that way: DUMB STUFF.
1412,I got this computer as a gift. I love the capabilities for the price as i do mostly everyday jobs on the computer. I do not have much in the way of gaming here.
1413,"Acer consistently seems to make great everyday laptops which last for a fair amount of time. Ordering this 2019 released laptop in 2022 can be seen as an interesting move, but I was pleasantly surprised and how functional it is for the price. At $499 (at the time of this post), you’re looking at a midrange specs simple pc that handles Windows 11 very quickly."
1414,"I just bought this laptop and right out of the box, I got the blue screen of death. It keeps going blue screen error to restart, repeat over and over. Customer support would not help me. They will not allow me to return it nor refund me, told me to contact manufacturer. Manufacturer states they cannot assist with product purchased on Amazon. Now I am out $400 and a laptop. I am BEYOND furious. DO NOT BUY!!!!"
1415,"I bought this Acer to replace one I have had for over 2 years.  This acer worked for 3 weeks.  While doing a prompted update, my Acer got a blue screen.  I cannot do a factory reset or anything else to correct the error.  Good luck if you purchase this model."
1416,"I had to replace my former laptop and went with the Acer Aspire 5. For what I need, it has been an outstanding purchase so far. I have had no problems with the computer. It is very fast. I'm not a game player, but the ""old"" games I play are easy work for the Acer. in short, I'm happy with it; and, knock on wood, hope it will give me several years of good service. I also like that it is made in Tiawan. I will update if anything goes wrong, but it's a great computer so far."
1417,"Had the computer for three weeks, with only a total of 3 applications installed when I received the blue screen of death. Did what I could to fix it, did an entire reset and thought it was good before it died again."
1418,"The HDMI port is broken, cannot hold a connection to my monitor, screen keeps blacking out. I'm past the return window so this is worthless now, tried different cords and no solution has been found. Will never trust Acer laptops again."
1419,"I want to start off by saying I am by no means extremely knowledgeable about computers. I know how to turn them on, use them, run programs, etc. But that’s about it. I know basics about storage size and speed. But, even that knowledge is minimal. So, this review is purely from a novice everyday computer user, NOT a computer expert or anywhere close. That’s why I am going to provide the specs straight from the computer at the end of my review, so hopefully if someone does know exactly the specs they want, that info will help."
1420,Amazing laptop for being midrange. Honestly the only thing is the build quality needs improvement.  Internal specs are great and doesn't heat up or slow down after constant use. Love windows 11 since it allows you to use Android apps and not just the Microsoft store. Battery life is great.  Don't really have any complaints except build quality but for the price they had to cut a corner somewhere and I would take performance over build quality anyday.
1421,"This computer is completely useless!  Waste of money!  To make matters worse, you only have 30 days to return.  It arrived on 7/16 today is 8/17 and I am unable to return!!!"
1422,It can connect to my acer desktop so what I had in my desktop I also have the same thing in my laptop. That’s pretty cool. The screen size and weight are good. It is clean silver color. It has lots of different plug holes.
1423,"I received this April 21st of this year, On May 30th I went to pick it up and it was so hot you couldn't hold it and it would not power on.  I contacted Amazon and the company.  Once again on June 20th this happened again and it took two days before I could get it to power on.  Once again I filed a complaint with Amazon and the company requesting a new one sent to me.  I have yet received any phone call or notification to resolve this issue."
1424,"Size, weight, display and speed are all very good. This was the best laptop I found anywhere for the price. It replaced an old Acer laptop we gave to our grandson to use in school. He's happy, we're happy. Didn't rate for Gaming because we don't use our computers for games. Didn't rate For touch screen because this model doesn't have one. Summary is: good laptop at a fair price."
1425,"After having this laptop for about two months, it will no longer contact to the internet. I’ve tried multiple different ways of trying to fix it, but nothing works. (Restarting, troubleshooting, trying different Wi-Fi, etc) I start school in a couple weeks and only have a $400 paper weight."
1426,"Tenía miedo al comprar una computadora online, finalmente lo hizo y tengo para decir que estoy encantada con mi pc, es súper rápida, vino rápidamente y con todo nuevo, ni un rasguño. La recomiendo 100% es una pc muy linda, en mi caso solo la uso para cosas básicas así que no tengo idea de cómo es para videos juegos u otras funciones. Espero y le sea de ayuda."
1427,"If you have a new college student, and you are on a budget, this is a good entry laptop that will do what they need for college.  Its not powerful enough to do high end graphics or gaming, but you can play some Fortnite on low settings just fine, as well as some basic Photoshop editing."
1428,"This Acer laptop is well made mid-tier, power conscious portable focusing more on productivity and less on gaming. There is no discrete graphics, only AMD Radeon graphics for light gaming at low resolutions. This laptop is perfect for mobile users that want a fast processor with plenty of RAM and good battery life without the need for power hungry discrete graphics."
1429,"This is a great little laptop for checking emails, surfing the web, and doing basic stuff. It's not great for photo editing, rendering videos, or other processor-intensive tasks, though. If you're looking to do some light gaming (very light) you can easily upgrade the ram and storage (they include a kit to add an SSD to the system, which is awesome). I use it to run my laser cutter and it does fine now that I've bumped the RAM up to 16GB. I don't need any storage on this machine, which is good because it really doesn't come with any."
1430,This is the third Acer we’ve owned and everyone has been total quality. Laptops and tablet have been very fast response and no issues. After my experience with Dell pleased as Acer is a quality manufacturing company.
1431,Biggest case of buyers remorse in my life. Always bought HP with Intel hardware but figured with the reviews for this Acer Aspire 5 with AMD Ryzen 5 and Radeon graphics why not explore unfamiliar territory and see what the hype was about in the reviews. This Acer Aspire 5 for $489 Brand New shipped to the door I was astonished the laptop didn't come with an actual user manual. Was even more pissed that you can not setup and use this without first connecting to a WiFi network.
1432,I got this laptop for a good price and with enough room for updates. My old laptop didnt have enough room and eventually wouldnt update anything because it had 4 Gbs of Ram. I stream on this and am happy with the quality and sound.
1433,"I bought this laptop to replace my wife's broken Lenovo. I have to say, as a MacBook user, this is a great value laptop for regular users. She uses this for web browsing, shopping, email and light gaming. This system is responsive, nice screen and thus far no real lagging while doing these tasks. I like the implementation of Windows 11 on this device as well. YMMV."
1434,"It set up fine but second day it didn't boot into windows, I went through a reset software procedure and all is well. I like the backlit keyboard and metal top cover, also seems fast."
1435,"My HP Pavilion died.  I contacted HP Support, and they told me that I needed to buy a new laptop.  I am so glad that I purchased this Acer laptop!  I love it!"
1436,"Screen quality and resolution is great. I have owned several laptops before and this sleek beauty is by far becoming one of my favorites. Easy set up and decent battery life, very responsive with no lag. This will be great for 3D designing and printing. Well worth the purchase."
1437,The computer arrived on time. I was very happy and satisfied with the purchase. I bought the computer as a replacement for my son's computer for school. It is great during conference zoom video and computer screensharing is great with clarity.
1438,"There is a half inch decrease in width, no decrease in length, but a 1"" decrease in keyboard width -- which is all in the number pad, now 2x4"" (previously 3x4).  The pad is almost impossible to use without a typo.  The enter button is shrunk so small it's easier to use the one on the main keyboard.  Look at the photo carefully.  I don't game, and I use a mouse, so no comment on that.  Some optical improvement, I suppose."
1439,"Seems to work well. Haven’t really done much with it, but has been an improvement over what I had. Would not suggest for gaming. No dvd/cd player, but an external can be purchased for less than $30."
1440,"No real complaints, other than the occasional times where the touchpad would be difficult when selecting/clicking on things; it was like it got stuck. Guess in the near future, I’ll have to invest in a separate mouse to use, if it persists."
1441,I'm a longtime Acer user and I bought this Acer laptop because I liked that it had a second hard drive bay and I wanted to install the hard drive from my old Acer laptop in the bay so I could run my Linux OS rather than the windoze virus.
1442,I was in need of a new laptop and after doing a lot of research I decided this would be the best one for me. It's great for basic use or for work. I'm very happy with this laptop.
1443,"I just needed this to begin working from home, and for the price it’s great! Very fast and runs my heavier software for work like a breeze. A great option if you just need to do simple tasks- I can’t speak on its gaming ability as I have other systems for that."
1444,"I love my new laptop, but it’s got almost 0 space for anything. I tried backing up my phone to it (which btw iTunes SUCKS on Microsoft) and it couldn’t hold. However, I was able to download a series of games, and it does well with split screen and office work. I’m not sure if I have a touch screen. If I do, it doesn’t work."
1445,"I'm used to Macs, so there was a bit of a learning curve, but I'm very happy with this machine.  The screen resolution is great and I love the Microsoft Edge browser.  I usually download Firefox to all of my laptops, but I decided to give Edge a try and I'm completely satisfied with it.  The overall look of the Acer is very sleek and modern and looks a lot like my daughter's Macbook Pro Air."
1446,Glad I finally got this laptop been on my radar for a while now. I was instantly interested after learning which processor and version of GPU it had. Additional ram slot and came with the parts to add in the additional hard drive ( I did an ssd for faster speeds.)
1447,"I have had about a month now. I was skeptical due to the low price, but computer has been great. I work from home so I use it a lot."
1448,"The screen started blacking out within 48 hours. I've already returned it for a refund. I had high hopes for this laptop, but I should have known better. You get what you pay for."
1449,So far I am very impressed with this laptop. I don't put it through a lot of stressful stuff like high quality gaming but the screen is sharp and clear and the laptop is speedy and responsive. As a relatively low cost option for work or school it seems like a great choice.
1450,Backlit keyboard goes out after a few minutes.  Need to find the correct key in the dark to turn on backlit every few minutes....very smart Acer.  Keyboard died after a week. Had to go through all the suggested ways to fix.  Had to mail in for service.
1451,Gets hot immediately. Fan does not change speeds with fn f like ad. Dragging files stops working and locks up the whole computer. I had to reboot many times just to move my files around the first day: nothing else was running. It used all the memory for a minute after I moved a large file and froze if I tried to do anything else….while literally everything was off and the file was fully moved.
1452,"Trackpad terrible. I do not get it. Otherwise works well for what it is. Low-end machine but screen is good, ports are good, it's nice and sleek enough for the price. But damn Windows machines have had terrible trackpads for years and STILL they suck. Just do what Apple does with their MacBooks it can't be that hard!"
1453,"This computer is PERFECT for me!  Thank you for offering it to all of us; The updating process was a breeze, which was not so with other computers in the past.  I even added a 5TB external hard drive to it without any difficulty at all.  YAHOO!!!  😘❤️🌹"
1454,"I got this pc after doing my research, and it showed me that this pc is the best bang for the buck at $400.  It's remarkably fast and just great for general internet use.  I did not buy it to play games, and I don't use the touch screen.  I highly recommend it for anyone just using a pc for general internet use.  By the way, I love the backlit keyboard."
1455,"whoever designed this laptop is an idiot when it came to picking where to put the speakers. they are under the laptop!!!! so they are always muted unless you prop it up with something. so, if you plan on watching anything with sound, you're going to want another source for the sound."
1456,"Package arrived in good shape, plugged computer to charge, 2 hours later computer was very very HOT and not responsive, Being returned for replacement.  I now have an Acer desk top computer and like it very much so will try this one again, Hoping for the best."
1457,Booted up fine went through updates and loaded a pdf scanner and loaded documents in short time. My old computer quit in time for tax’s but this is a much better computer and looking forward to years of use.
1458,"Not sure about battery life, as I just purchased. Screen resolution seems good. Like that it is thin and lightweight. I am only using for web browsing, so not sure how it would be for gaming."
1459,Fan is the loudest laptop fan I've ever heard. This apperntly is is known and I should have researched more.  I used it 4 times for basic set up and web. Completely shut off for a whole day on me within a week. Amazon support told me to call acer. Problem fixed it self. Now the screen Completely went blank. 36 days after purchase. No games and no extra downloads. I turned it on and payed bills. Don't buy it!
1460,"Llevo usando esta laptop aproximadamente 3 meses, cumple todo lo prometido, como trabajos en Word Excel, etc..., le mejore ram y almacenamiento para poder jugar juegos basicos como Fortnite o Minecraft. La recomendaria para trabajos basicos y juego ligero. Hasta ahora no presenta falla."
1461,"Product arrived with a defective USB port.  Took a week to get a label to return it and had to provide my own boxes and had to pay to insure it out of my pocket.  Mind you, a brand-new product and I had to provide the box and insurance.  When I had warranty work done on my HP; they shipped me a box with padding in just a couple days and I downloaded a label immediately.  This ACER and support are very disappointing.  I dread to think how long I may have to wait to get it fixed and returned."
1462,With the s mode I was not able to install my printer also Google and Google app store you may want to think this over.serfing is good and is fast.
1463,"I love this laptop! It does what I need it to without adding upgrades (though I might do that so it runs more smoothly). Any Acer computer is amazing, I love this brand recommended to me by my brother who's bought from them for 10 years!"
1464,Over all I feel it is a great laptop for me.  My only  2 issues with it are cursor lag tracking at times and that it doesnt have a dvd drive.  My previous laptops did.
1465,Crashed after only 6 months. Nothing working to bring it back. Bought this for my son. Laggy for playing Minecraft and Roblox. Ok for Terraria but now it will not boot up at all. Caught in endless repair loop.
1466,"I think for 350-400 this laptop is probably one of the best you could find, especially considering it's size. I'm not sure how people are having trouble switching out of S mode, but I did it in literal seconds (for free, no clue how people are getting messages they have to pay) after I was able to access the desktop so that's a complete non-issue. It also looks a bit more expensive than it is which is cool I guess."
1467,"Had to get a new one because our other laptop finally died after 7 years. Didn’t want to spend a lot of money and would mostly be using it for just browsing the web, Zoom meetings, watching YouTube videos and mild gaming. So far it runs perfectly and smoothly. Must switch it out of S mode to get Zoom installed…"
1468,"I purchased this laptop to provide a great value at this price point.  It hasn't disappointed.  Very easy to upgrade the memory by 16GB to a total 20GB.  The 128GB NVMe SSD makes application loading very quick.  With most of my storage in the cloud, this is the perfect laptop for everyday business/personal use."
1469,"If you like using Chrome, then avoid Windows 11. It was engineered to force you to adopt Microsoft Edge. This and many other laptops are being built with Windows 11."
1470,"This laptop is useless and a waste of money.  It apparently was owned before with setup being impossible.  I’m not the sharpest knife in the drawer anymore, but I can still cut.  After weeks of trying, frustration, I’m giving up!!!!!!"
1471,"Bought this computer for development work. The main features I cared about were the SSD regardless of its relative low capacity, the 15.6 inch screen at 1080p, backlit keyboard, and ability to upgrade."
1472,"I purchased this product in hopes of being able to download and do what is normal on a laptop computer.  This laptop came in S MODE and it was impossible to get out of S MODE.  Asurion, Acer and Microsoft could not help in this matter.  What a disappointment.  DO NOT BUY!"
1473,"For what I do it’s perfect. Slim ,light and what a screen! I did my share of searching and shopping and you can’t get these features at this price anywhere except ACER"
1474,Everything was good about it especially for price but couldn't put a hdd in it to increase  storage because the connector inside was super cheap and broken on arrival so they sent me a replacement and that one had the same issue is your ok with the limited storage it's a fine computer could probably upgrade the ssd on it but was trying to increase storage cheaply with hdd but couldn't because the connectors wouldn't lock in
1475,Ryzen 3 speed is fine for browsing and light duty tasks. so far ok. Quality of screen and build quality is good. Would buy again.  *Upgraders:* only 1 open sodimm slot avail * Comes with HDD tray which is nice.
1476,"Just received computer Acer Aspire 5 A515-46-R3UB | 15.6"" Full HD IPS Display | AMD Ryzen 3 3350U Quad-Core Mobile Processor | 4GB DDR4 | 128GB NVMe and the mouse pad does not work, unable to set it up, amazon is replacing the computer."
1477,S mode makes it impossible to my email and most apps I have used forever. Disabling it affects security and performance according to Microsoft.  It seems more of a ploy for Microsoft to monopolize on my purchases. Otherwise the laptop is great
1478,We purchased 2 of these. One totally quit working. You can't even open in safe mode. It's useless to us. And now it's too late to send back. So we're paying for nothing....literally.
1479,"Great price, great product.  No glitches, no delays.  Screen has clear and clean color.  It moves rapidly from site to site.  I guess my only complaint would be the small keys.  I make a lot of typing errors.  This comp was my choice and I am adapting.  I have experienced no negatives so far at all.  I highly recommend it."
1480,"Difficult to open computer, nothing to hold or grip on top portion or lower portion of computer. I have it setting on a folding table and the gripper feet on bottom of computer do not grip the table surface, so computer slides away from you when you try and open it!"
1481,The Acer Aspire 15 has been a super great laptop. It's probably one of the best tech purchases I have ever made and I'm an IT guy. I paid about $350 USD for this one and am very happy with the purchase. The last time I was searching for a Laptop I returned 5 laptops before I was satisfied so I'm pretty picky. This was for my wife but I use it at night when I'm not in my office sometimes.
1482,"we bought this model instead of the similar model with intel processor after reading the review that although both models have a second ram slot for upgrading ram,  the model with intel process has the 4 gb ram soldered in, while this one with AMD processor has the 4gb ram replacerble. however, when we openned the back, it appears the 4gb RAM is soldered in because we only see one emplty ram slot (and didn't see another RAM that can be replaced."
1483,"This is the least expensive computer I've ever owned, and I am very pleased with its performance.  Probably this means that I've been buying more than I really need in a computer.  This bargain computer does email,  word processing, online purchasing, and video streaming very well.  No problems with the trackpad like I had with my most recent computer.  I am glad to have found this!"
1484,"Has large screen portable, with decent speed, storage and many external ports.  slightly heavy but have note pads if I want to be mobile. I really like having a lot of external ports so I don't have to unplug my mouse  to use other pieces of hardware which really aggravated me with note pads.  Can't hand zoom the screen, but screen is plenty big enough.  Battery life is fairly long, but cord is very long.  Storage is excellent and no problems with speed.  Operates windows 11.  I personally love the machine and glad to be back with a real computer."
1485,I have a few of these for classes. They spend more time under warranty repair than they do in the classroom. Spend a little more for an hp or dell. Lesson learned.
1486,"Producto de calidad, es de cuerpo metálico, aunque tiene poca memoria RAM tiene un slot para expandirla, así mismo trae el mecanismo para aumentarle el almacenamiento interno. Para un estudiante está más que suficiente siempre y cuando sea lo básico. Si necesitas instalar programas profesionales no te puede ser suficiente en cuanto a rendimiento. De lo demás, la mejor compra que he hecho."
1487,"This laptop comes with a kit to add an additional SSD or HDD, but the connection socket for the cable will not lock on, making installation impossible.  This same issue was present in the first PC I ordered and the replacement I received as well.  Poor quality components make for nonfunctional equipment and unhappy customers.  Advise you stay far away from this one."
1488,"Great laptop for the price! Sturdy build, great screen image and size. I did add a 16GB module and an SK Hynix Gold S31 SSD 1TB internal drive. Love the keyboard back lighting and have no complaints."
1489,I won't have thought it possible......for Microsoft to come up with a more user hostile....counter intuitive.....pile of crap that is actually WORSE then windows 10. BUT THEY DID! Windows 11 makes Windows 10 look great by comparison!!
1490,"Great laptop! Only downside is there's no indicator from we capslock is on, which can be a pain when it's accidentally toggled when typing in passwords, etc. Other than that, love it!"
1491,Only has one ram slot and a soldered on 4gb of ram so can upgrade enough and the hard drive can be added I like the ability to choose your own hard drive size to put in instead of being stuck with a low amount... Less ewaste.  Also speaking of the hard drive I had read a review about the hard drive ribbon cable connector you cannot lift up you have to unscrew the Wi-Fi chip to be able to lift a little tab for the hard drive ribbon cable see picture
1492,Windows in S mode does not support Zoom. You will need to disable S mode for video conferencing. The Ryzen 3 processor cannot support virtual backgrounds so you won’t be able to blur your background for meetings. I would not recommend this laptop for any professional use.
1493,"I bought this for my wife, who does e-Bay, Skype calls to family, normal business stuff and no gaming. I was very surprised that it have better performance than I expect for an entry level machine. The screen and keyboard are magnificent."
1494,"Great laptop for the price, I don't think you can find a laptop this great at this price point. Appearance looks great, great build quality, keyboard does not at all feel cheap at all and the keyboard backlight is a great touch. Very lightweight. Touch pad is large and responsive. I have not tried the fingerprint scanner yet. Decently fast boot up times given it has an SSD. Battery life is actually pretty great, too. I am happy with the ports, it even has a USB C port. Screen gets very bright."
1495,Horrible Slow out of the box . Simple things like running You tube from Microsoft store won’t work . As many users say Windows 10 S is horribly constricting and most apps do not run well.
1496,"Worked great for the first 4 months barely got to this 4th month. The screen started to have issues and now all of a sudden you can't even turn screen on. Won't buy from this seller again. Outside of my return window, naturally."
1497,I do not like this laptop and I want to return it for a refund or another laptop. I had no idea just what S Mode means and I can not work  with it and I can not get S Mode removed!
1498,"I rarely do reviews on products I buy. However, this product deserves a recommendation. I bought this machine for my wife, whose old machine had become too slow. While Intel processors are still the top of the line this AMD processor-based PC is a very good machine. For the price, it is a great buy."
1499,I had it less than a month and the touchpad stopped working. Of course the last day for me to return it was April 2nd and the second it went out it was April 5th.  So I had to go and a mouse to troubleshoot. I tried every avenue advised and it still isn't working.
1500,Es increible que el producto haya llegado usado ya que compre una nueva. Nosotros somos de Argentina y aprovechamos el viaje para comprar una notebook y ahora debo devolverla y volver a mi pais sin computadora porque no tengo tiempo!!!!!
1501,I bought this for work and school.  It is great to use. The key board is easy to touch and letters type quick. It is very useful and suit my needs.
1502,"This is a great laptop for the price . Fast , ease of you. Just beware that you also have to pay $99 per year for word, excel etc. comes with no software"
1503,I really like this laptop it’s not the top of the line but it performs perfectly for me. It’s quiet running it turns on quickly a lightweight machine definitely worth the money I can’t find anything or say anything negative about the purchase of this Acer Laptop.
1504,"I have only had this laptop for a few days. Seems to function as designed. Is fast. Screen is bright. Keyboard backlight feature is awesome, especially during the evening hours. Keyboard is standard for a laptop but is easy to use, even when switching from a full size keyboard for a desktop. 2TB USB drive accommodates all necessary files. Easy access to the Internet for cloud drive setup. So far, awesome machine!! Now to go a purchase a carry case!!!"
1505,We bought this laptop to replace our old acer. We have tried numerous things to transfer our documents from the old computer.  We now have taken it to a  computer shop and have to pay someone to do it for us. But even he said it was difficult to transfer on this computer.
1506,"I bought this 2 wks ago to replace my Dell laptop that crashed. I LOVE this laptop !! It is so easy, fast, sleek, great keyboard for fast typing, great screen quality and more. I am amazed for the price!! Did I mention fast?!"
1507,So far no dislikes - it’s large screen is perfect for work and makes working on the go easy breezy. My wife did a great job in picking this computer & thank you to everyone who reviewed before me for inspiring her purchase! Cheesy 🙈 but honest ✌🏼
1508,"I really like the load times, screen quality, and basic functions on the keyboard.  It's nice that it comes with windows 11 but it'd be cool if there was an option for 10.  I use this for school, so I have no idea if it's good for gaming or not.  You can have half a million tabs open and the laptop will run just fine, the fans are quiet too.  Overall I'd highly recommend this laptop to anyone"
1509,"This is the second Acer I owned and while I was happy with my old one, this is much faster.  That’s what I wanted: speed, light weight and bargain priced. I use it for Quicken software- so be aware this laptop comes loaded with Windows 11 which will NOT run Quicken without first disabling the S mode.  That’s what I did and it runs fine but had to add anti-virus software.  Not a big deal.  Just fyi Quicken users!"
1510,Just what I've been looking for. I've had a Chromebook which is great but I needed to get something that could run windows based programs but couldn't afford a lot of money. This is perfect!!!
1511,"Our old laptop died one afternoon... dead hard drive. I ordered the Acer at 7:00 pm and it was delivered at 5:30 the next morning. About two hours to set it up, transfer files, etc. and it was good to go! The SS Drive makes it quick and responsive, and so far Windows 11 has been well behaved, Nice little machine for the money."
1512,"Acer advertises that you can put a hard drive in the laptop.  You can put a hard drive in the laptop.  However, the connector on the mother board will not hold the ribbon cable down to make a good connection, therefore, the hard drive will not get recognized by the system."
1513,"This laptop has a really good battery life, it starts up quickly, and it overall is a fast computer. I only needed it for some school work, so for me it works great. It also had a really great price tag which was also a plus."
1514,"I am not very happy with this computer.  NOT user friendly-has a mind of it's own.  Sometimes hard to get around.  Not very happy with Microsoft 11.  I liked the last one I had-Acer, but it was 10 and easy to use.  It just died after 1 year.  Thought it was the cord, so bought one.  NOO.  Took it to my computer genius, and could not find a motherboard after months of looking.  Now I have 2 cords and this new one uses a different one!  UGH"
1515,i love how light the laptop is and that you can easily upgrade the ram and storage. So don't think you're stuck with 128gb. Windows 11 was included on the laptop so get ready for the next learning curve. I use mine for work and its pretty quick and responsive. I'm very surprised at the price point for what you get. fingerprint scanner is very fast. So as far as budget laptops I have to say I really like this one.
1516,"I just ""wore out"" another stupid charging cord. the thing doesn't stay in. the thin connector, combined with the overly large, L shaped end constantly falls out with the slightest movement. i hate this computer. it was an affordable replacement to my first acer that up and died on me approximately 1 year after purchase. I will never again purchase Acer"
1517,"Windows S Mode is worthless; you can't install any of your own software, such as software you already own.  You can only install software from the Microsoft Store -- just stupid ""apps"", not real programs"
1518,Item was listed in the 2-1 tablet section but was a full size laptop! Due to disability was too heavy for me plus was too complex for my skill level! Appeared to be a really nice laptop for the right user!
1519,"I don't do gaming or have the touch screen, but for what I need it for, it works great.  Very fast and up to date.  The price was right too.  Yes I would recommend"
1520,Laptop arrived. Got it set up and works as advertised. It is not a gaming or touch screen just a standard laptop. I wish it came with a Microsoft word program but I will just buy that too. Hopefully it lasts more than two years.
1521,"Easy to upgrade computer if you put a few moments in, save hundreds of bucks. I am so glad I did this instead of spending money to do things we all can do. Watch you tube"
1522,"It took me a while to find a decent computer for my home needs.  I like the lightweight of this computer, the small number keypad to the side and the efficiency of the computer.  I'm not a regular home pc user but when I need to do something, it takes seconds on this computer.  I would highly recommend.  I'm not a gamer nor do I watch movies and stuff, but for surfing the internet, created docs, sheets and printing, I love this pc."
1523,"I bought this notebook on the 6th of July. I have been using every day. I never owned a notebook, so wasn't sure what to expect. Do not hesitate to buy this product. I am very impressed w the price tag and performance. The screen quality is excellent. Very sturdy and reliable. Very happy w this purchase."
1524,"This laptop is just what I needed. It is fast, light and quiet. I only use for browsing, streaming and a few games but the quality and performance is amazing for the low price."
1525,I live in a mountainous area & my WiFi can be spotty but only had 1 instance where didn't have wifi. Also printer issues but I think that's just me. Happy with purchase
1526,"I had a problem with this one changing the program on my other computer, even though I was setting it up as a stand alone.  It was messing up everything. Otherwise it was a nice laptop."
1527,"If you have to open this thing multiple times a day, that will likely be one of your only issues. They designed this in a way that makes it pretty hard to open. Otherwise, great laptop."
1528,"I mean computer works, it does what it's supposed to do. I installed a Acer 480 SSD to increase it's capacity and 8 GB DDR4 stick.(No ram included) You will notice your fan go crazy fast during the set up process, that's the CPU trying to process everything. Windows updates also make CPU usage high and make fan go crazy fast, sounds like a airplane about to take off!. 🛫😳"
1529,So this is a pretty decent budget laptop! Runs pretty fast and gets the job done. My BIGGEST complaints are the wireless card and the ethernet port. They are both pretty bad. The wireless card is weak. The ethernet port is designed with a lip that doesn't securely hold the ethernet piece in and so any movement and you'll be knocked offline.
1530,Made the purchase to have a new computer for our son (10yrs old) for the coming school year. It does everything he needs it to do. I have had an Acer before and was always satisfied with it.
1531,"The screen is very good. Keyboard is comfortable. Easy to update a SSD and RAM. Add a16GB RAM, you got 20GB totally. Win is 11 also very good to use. Almost spotless if it is not used for gaming."
1532,"As an adult returning to college, this laptop is perfect for me! It's sturdy but not bulky, and the screen is so much easier on my eyes than the tablet I had been using."
1533,Nice screen with a few extras like the finger print scanner and backlit keyboard is great but it runs hot.  Not being able to sit this unit in my lap and work comfortably is a deal breaker.
1534,"My new Acer laptop came today and I could not be more pleased. I want to address just a couple of issues that I read in the reviews. First, it is very easy to get out of S mode. I just googled it and it gave me step by step (settings, activation, click the Switch our of S mode which will take you to the microsoft store and just click get/install. No, it does NOT ask you to pay for anything (unless you click the wrong go to the microsoft store)."
1535,Let me shake off the review cobwebs for this because i am disappointed.  It's the small stuff that becomes annoying after a while. A good basic laptop but the reasons why i am returning them is as follows.
1536,This laptop is great. Screen quality is awesome and antiglare is great. WiFi speed gave me the full 100mbps of my network speed. Fast to startup. Love the Backlit keys.
1537,I bought this for myself. I love that it has the backlit keyboard. The battery has a long life. It is not touch screen so I’m not sure why the review is asking about that. As for gaming I have no idea! So far I love it and haven’t had any issues. It’s a great laptop for the price.
1538,"Me encanta, está súper funcional. Yo le agregué otra ram de 8 para tener 12 porque solo 4 trae, pero lo demás está excelente. La resolución de la pantalla esta perfecta y el sonido también."
1539,"I can't believe this touchpad went out. For the price I got it, it's not worth dealing with customer service to get this fixed as I need it for work. Guess I'll just get a mouse. Can easily add in RAM and another 2.5"" ssd while swapping out NVMe  if you so desired. Does it's job just C'mon TOUCHPAD!"
1540,"I bought this laptop just to have something ""mobile"" when I want to get online or do some ""light work"" out of the house (I normally use my desktop computer which is a BEAST!)"
1541,I got this laptop for light use in the office in our meeting room. Everyone has had no issues using it and it does everything we need for meeting purposes. It's fast and light weight so it's great!
1542,"I had problems with this model, it would not fully charge, I sent it back for a replacement and encountered the same problem, so I do not recommend this computer"
1543,This laptop comes with a moderately small SSD drive and 4 GB of RAM. The RAM is the minimum requirement for Windows 11 and it shows. Just after boot with no apps running the RAM is at 90% in use.
1544,"This is the 4th one of these that I've bought!  With it being all solid state, battery life is excellent.  Startup is very fast.  I've added a second SSD to two of them with no problems.  It even comes with the necessary hardware to add it.  It's not fast enough for intensive gaming but plenty fast for games like Minecraft, which the kids like.  Being solid state also makes it quite rugged."
1545,"I don't game, nor do I use it on battery only.  Yes, the weight is decent.  It is quick to turn on and functions well.  I use it with an added keyboard."
1546,"Bought this to take notes and do videos for a college course. It's working well, and lasts 2-3 classes (1/week) before I have to plug it in at home to recharge. All my old laptops were very old or cracked screen, so had to buy a new one as it was required for the class. It is doing well with all the documents and videos I have to use."
1547,"It's very slim! Lightweight as well and it's my favorite laptop I've ever had. The speed is fast, but I assume because I don't have a bunch of used up storage. The screen is big enough for me, I don't need anything bigger. I use It for applications or if I can't see something good enough on my phone. Affordable price as well."
1548,"This laptop is pretty good. Keypad has a weird layout, and the keyboard lacks proper Home, End, PageUp, and PageDown keys. Oddly enough, Shift+Home works if you do LShift+RShift+Home, while LShift+RShift+End does not work and is just treated as End."
1549,This  laptop is a good quality for the price and the picture is good. The sound is not as good as a high end laptop but most people use headphones anyways. I really like that the keys have a grip type coding on them. My work laptop that is four times the price does not have this and I wish it did.
1550,"Great computer for what I need, had to take it out of S mode and I'll have to upgrade the ram (easy to do) but overall a great budget computer"
1551,"Una Laptop con diseño elegante y caracteristicas decentes, ideal para trabajo de oficina como es mi caso, tambien la puedes usar para colegio o universidad, siempre y cuando no sea para juegos o diseño grafico, para esos casos hay mejores laptop pero mucho mas caras."
1552,"I tried two different types of DDR4 sticks to expand the memory and both failed. It can't boot after installed it, no any display even the logo... pls help advice."
1553,"Una de las razones por las que compre esta laptop(versión i3 de 12 generación) fue por que supuestamente tenia teclado retroiluminado, pro no es así. Por lo demás, muy contento"
1554,"Great computer for price. Works nicely, can switch apps and surf fast and easy. Good storage, plays basic games and can stream easily. RAM is easily upgradeable, I would suggest upgrading to 8gb or higher RAM."
1555,"The laptop has a very bad battery and very noisy ventilation.Even without loads it is noisy.The battery lasts for 2-2.30 hours watching video.On another model with Rysen,it works 5-6 hours and does not make noise.In addition,here the ventilation goes directly into the screen.Absolutely useless.I do not recommend this model"
1556,I wanted a new computer with Windows 11 and could not upgrade my old Toshiba. I don't play games or do a lot on the computer so it fits my needs.
1557,"This budget laptop features Windows 11, and a nice display. It is a familiar wedge shape, and weight is moderate. The top part is made of aluminum for stiffness, the bottom part is plastic. The nice, bright 1080p display has thin borders on two side to give the laptop a clean, modern look. There are plenty of ports, including USB-A and USB-C, plus HDMI and ethernet. Sound quality is decent for watching streaming videos - good at reproducing voices. The trackpad is a nice size and the keyboard has a good enough feel for typing."
1558,"All the useful features are locked out! After I FINALLY got into the BIOS setup (Which took HOURS of messing around and checking for on-line solutions!), I called ACER support.  They informed me the laptop is ONLY to be used AS DELIVERED!  No external DVD boot, or USB boot, which I require for Dual-Boot capabilities, (Windows and Linux) which I have required and had for at least 15 years.  WORTHLESS!"
1559,me parece aceptable el producto para su precio está más que bien el problema que tiene es que viene con la BIOS desactualizada y va a tener un error de que no reconoce el cargador no se asusten entren a la página de acer y descarguen la BIOS actualizada  y luego abajo de la laptop trae  un huequito para reiniciar la batería lo unden por 10 segundos y se arregla el problema al parecer viene por defecto de fabrica pero si actualizas la BIOS se soluciona todo
1560,"The laptop itself seems to work great.  However while what I ordered was not listed as refurbished,  the power supply included was for a random company, not Acer, and did not actually charge the laptop.  Once I bought a compatible charger, it is working well, but ridiculous that it did not arrive with a valid charger."
1561,I just wanted a small PC to do some simple tasks that need to be run on a PC only. Fits the bills really well. Can’t imagine it had any horse power to do anything heavy graphics duty wise. But that wasn’t the purpose of buying this laptop.
1562,"What a piece of crap, wont charge. Acer needs a 10 days to send out new charger, might not fix the problem. NEVER BUYING AN ACER AGAIN. Also window s mode is a bunch of crap. Dont buy this. Amazon this is a problem."
1563,"I love this computer, it is light and fast. It comes with a big screen, full size key board with a number pad (which I find so much easier for doing bills, only shopping etc)."
1564,this is my second acer. the only problem is i can get my usb printer to talk to the acer with windows 11. there must be a way but i spent 10 hours yesterday trying and  have accepted i'll have to get a new printer.
1565,"This laptop is extremely user-friendly and has a smooth layout for productivity.  The desktop wallpapers and the desktop themes are simplistic as well as eye-catching.  All-in-all, with this laptop, everything seems to be more streamlined which helps me focus on my goals and daily tasks."
1566,Added a larger SSD storage and 4GB more RAM. Could not be happier with this laptop for the price. Picture quality is great. Much better than expected for a laptop in this price range.
1567,"This laptop is for sure one of the best laptop for everyday use, and works great for almost everyone. The design is chic and simple. It's very light weighted so easy to carry with you anywhere you want or even travel with. The sizing is perfect as it has 15.6"" monitor so still pretty big size to be able to do any work with. For the price, it's super powerful and works great even for some graphic and architectural design works and applications. It's slim which is exactly how I like."
1568,"After a couple months of use by my teenagers, the laptop seems to be holding up very well. It is responsive enough with Windows 11 for basic schoolwork or web browsing. Like the screen size and resolution. I initially had a concern that the laptop was not charging properly, but using the battery controller reset on the bottom seems to have solved the problem, it has been working well for several months now."
1569,"Overall is a good computer and works well, the screen looks great, it feels light and sturdy. The only problem I have is the retro-illuminated keyboard that the description says this computer has. There's no retro-illuminated keyboard on this laptop. I reached to Amazon Customer Service and they said There's nothing they can do (How about changing the product description?? And offer a discount on the price I paid for this?) This has been a really disappointing experience dealing with Amazon Customer service"
1570,"Normally I don't leave negative reviews but couldn't hold back this time.  Spent the last three hours trying to remove S Mode in order to install Google Chrome with no success.  Also, the charging cord wouldn't charge the battery.  Too bad because this was a stellar deal!"
1571,3rd time  buying this  laptop and its  awful keeps  freezing up and it's  not  as fast its suppose to be  not  buying anymore electronics  on amazon anyone was hoping it would be  good ha ha its not !!!!
1572,"La computadora por su precio esta bien.  No trae teclado iluminado como decia la descripcion y alguna de las respuestas dadas .  Algo que si mejoraria bastante es que el sonido es muy bajo, definitivamente no es una computadora para ver progamas o demas con mas de dos personas."
1573,"On the second day of use it started problematic charging. When charger was plugged in it kept charging for 5 minutes and then automatically stopped charging. It started charging again after unplugging and plugging again, but only for 5 more minutes. The laptop kept doing over and over again, just wont fully charge. Just didn't seem to be a trait of a brand new laptop. Wont recommend this seller."
1574,The product I received worked but the back panel was damaged. The shipping box wasn’t damaged and neither was the product box. There is two big cracks i the back panel and a dent.
1575,"The MS software included noted an ""S"".  This means it will ONLY download and accept Windows/Microsoft products.  I got rid of that (no going back) so I could use Google, Firefox, my security software and other things. Works fine. Paid $300 on Amazon's annual two-day sale."
1576,Laptop lasted maybe 30 minutes before it completely shut down and would not come back on. Not sure what the issue was but was really hoping for a quality long lasting laptop for my family and homeschool and did not get that.
1577,"La descripxion del producto esta mal, lo mas importante por lo que elegi esta laptop fue el teclado retroiluminado, favor corregir esto. Tambien al principio me ah dado problemas para cargar la laptop, de un momento ah otro deja de cargar."
1578,"I noticed that this laptop had a 10-key panel, and that's why I purchased this. However, I have since discovered that it is a very very condensed version of a 10-key.  It it not a standard ASCII keyboard.  If you do data entry for a living, you will HATE this laptop just based on that feature alone.  Shame on me for not discovering it before I purchased it, and shame on them for not disclosing it in the item description.  I'm gonna add the extended warranty and then take this thing for a swim in the hot tub"
1579,"You can't beat this machine for the price. Don't expect a miracle, but to get an I series processor in this (prime day sale) price range is pretty good. I did add ram (and downgrade to 10 pro), but even without that it was fine for everyday tasks. The main downside I've experienced is that the touch pad leaves a whole lot to be desired."
1580,"This Acer Chromebook is my new business laptop. It is dependable and fast. It has touch screen, amazing battery life, and light weight-perfect for travel. I love the clear and bright display. It can store a lot of files. Great value for money, I highly recommend!"
1581,"I had this monitor for almost a year and used it about once or twice a week, with my laptop for working on spreadsheets, QuickBooks, and other accounting things. I was very happy with it while it worked. I take very good care of my things and about a year after getting it the display started showing colored lines and distortions."
1582,i like the light weight. it was difficult to navigate through things. I was on zoom and got disconnected as I lost my hi-spied WiFi connection. Some other issues too.
1583,"Do not buy this laptop! Multiple issues with it, had to purchase a new power cord, and after letting it rest for a few months (untouched), this is what it looks like now after powering it up. Save your money and time and purchase something more reliable."
1584,"Absolute garbage product. Says every wifi requires login on a captive portal even on an open wifi with no captive portal. Because it won't let you connect to any wifi, you can't even get past the initial setup. Bad operating system prevents you from fixing the issue by bypassing the captive portal issue in the firewall. Complete waste of money, buy literally any other laptop that isn't chrome OS."
1585,"Well, after two months of light usage, the mouse is stuck and refuses to work. I went online and tried everything they recommended, I even did a hard factory reset and the mousepad is still frozen. I am so unhappy with this product, wish I never purchased it."
1586,Probably my only complaint is the startup setup and the limitations of the Chrome OS relative to Windows systems neither warranting a star off.  Immediately upon receipt you notice the weight of the box it is a little heavier than I was expecting.  It is a very solid build and feels really durable.
1587,"I had a smaller version of acer that I loved. I had to get a new one because I couldn't update the old one. My new acer does the same simple things the old one did except the new one is bigger. If you are looking for a laptop with memory, this is not it."
1588,I got this to free up some space on my IPad and phone.  I use it to play games and do lite paperwork.  It’s perfect for that.  There are so many apps in the google play store that can be downloaded on this.  I can save the storage on my other smart devices to use for other things.
1589,"I have the smaller Chromebook and have been satisfied with it as I use it daily (now in fact), as it's light and sits beside me at all times. The larger one filled my need to be able to view some files without having to manipulate them on the screen. Fast, efficient and avoiding the ""windows"" nightmare I used to have. Seems their ""auto updates"" wiped out 2 hard drives in past, but no such problem after going to chrome."
1590,We got this chromebook for our guest room. We like to have guests over and we like to make sure they have the best experience. So we got this chromebook so they can browse the internet in their downtime. It has been great so far! The guests love it.
1591,"Acer Chromebook 512 | Intel Celeron N4020 Processor | 12"" HD+ Display | Intel UHD Graphics 600 | 4GB LPDDR4 | 32GB eMMC | Intel 9560 802.11ac Gigabit WiFi 5 | MIL-STD 810G | Chrome OS | CB512-C1KJ"
1592,"Bought this for my son for virtual school. It seems to work fine for that, but don't expect it to do anything else beyond working inside Chrome. I've installed both Microsoft Office apps as well as the HP Smart printing app and neither work. They either fail to launch or crash. I have to restart the computer numerous times at each setting. So, if you want a laptop that you might use beyond the Chrome browser, I'd avoid a Chromebook."
1593,This is the second one we got.  We had to replace it due to the first touchscreen going out and they were unable to fix it.  Everything else about this is great so far.
1594,"My 314 Acer chromebook arrived on my front porch no announcement like ringing my illuminated doorbell, found it by accident while looking for the prognosticated snowfall. Opened it to find no soft sided travel case like the last Acer I bought. This time I opted for the 4 year Asurion plan, didn't get one last time as the last Acer was gotten from the Amazon ""Treasure truck.""  Just hope this one lasts more than 2 years!"
1595,"I am very happy with this Chromebook. Being a first-time user, it is a little bit of an adjustment after years of using computers that run the Windows operating system. But, for an internet-only computer, this has everything I need and more. (I don't have/use the touch-screen option. So, I can't speak to that feature.)"
1596,"Purchased for a specific task, Zoom / Web streaming. It’s only function, run Zoom and take the input from a BlackMagic ATEN switching 4 sources.  Great value for my needs"
1597,"Once I got used to Google space, it was great. Computer fires right up. Hard drive is solid state so it is quiet and since it uses less power it doesn't get warm, and the battery lasts a long time."
1598,"I tried using this product for my schoolwork which was a terrible idea, I wish I did more of my research. The Chromebook is basically just a large phone for playing games you could've played on your phone. just try and open up a PowerPoint file, its just gonna give you a chrome extension that's corrupted. I tried opening a zip file that i downloaded off my school website and it was empty. I then to find out that they were empty because my Chromebook blocks content it doesn't think is secure and doesn't tell you about it. Everywhere"
1599,"I bought 2 of these Chromebooks.  They were great until they stopped working.  One of them stopped charging about 5 months after I bought it.  Acer honored the warranty, and fixed it.  The 2nd one stopped charging about 6 months after I bought it, and Acer is not going to fix it.  Acer is saying it out of warranty even though I sent them proof of purchase showing that it is not.  These Chromebooks are not worth the hassle.  They do not last.  Very frustrating.  Poor product and poor service."
1600,"This Chromebook from Acer surprised me with how well it's made for less than $170, I wasn't expecting it to be this good. It has a few shortcomings but it's hard for me to really complain for the price. Some Chrome OS devices on the market are older and already several years into their supported lifespan, which is usually 5 years. This one is at the very beginning of that window, it will get updates until June 2027. This is not something people think about but it is important for having an up-to-date and secure device."
1601,"I am not new to chromebook.  This is for my family use.  The display is very good for the price.  The keyboard, the body finish are all good.  I like Acer chromebook comes with lots of usb ports on both sides."
1602,"I am not a tech savvy person, nor do I know enough to quote specs for this machine.  BUT, I do know that it works perfectly and was easy to set up/use for the person that is not tech savvy."
1603,My wife loves it.  I convinced her to get a  chromebook instead a windows laptop.  She likes simplicity and cuteness and it's  super lightweight and thin.  It also has a long battery life.
1604,"This is a smaller 12"" screen chromebook by Acer.  I have always had great luck with Acer products.  This computer is under $200 which is a great deal for a computer.  I love chromebooks because you can basically log in with your password and have access to all of your saved stuff."
1605,"For the price this is a good solid unit for any student who lives in the google sphere for school, or for the grandparent's email and other online needs.  It's a Chromebook so it performs like one, but this one is especially snappier than most and the durability is MIL std, so you can be assured it will take one heck of a beating.  So far, I've dropped it twice with no problems lol."
1606,Considering how inexpensive this Acer Chromebook 512 is I wasn’t expecting anything amazing. But I was actually pretty surprised at what $200 can get you these days in a chrome book!
1607,"This is my first netbook.  Must admit, I was a bit skeptical after so many years with computers.  Not really being into more compute power.  This is far more better than expected."
1608,I’ve had my chromebook for years and haven’t had any problems. My laptop is still working as it was when I bought it. I love this laptop so much I’m gonna buy my husband one for Christmas to replace his crappy HP laptop.
1609,"This Chromebook is surprisingly very nice! I was a bit skeptical with the low price tag, but it is super easy to set up and connect to Wi-Fi, and it moves at a decent speed. It is for my teenager to do his homework and play games, so it is truly perfect for that. It’s simple, yet great for the price. He is super happy with it!"
1610,"We have multiple phones and a 17 year old desktop computer, all of which will print to our Canon printer. This laptop does not. This is a brand new laptop and it would not configure to the printer automatically. Anyone can walk into our house and print right from their phone, so this does not make any sense in 2021 why this new laptop will not. I configured it manually like the online instructions say and it still won't print. The computer shows that it was sent and it's in the print cue but nothing...."
1611,Happyt with the machine.  Poorly packed though.  They just put the box into a much bigger box and threw in a piece of brown paper.  The computer rattled around badly inside the bigger box.  No damage that I could find.
1612,"Of course, I can't review definitively after only having it a couple of days. But I like the look and feel (sturdy and not too heavy). Everything started up and works fine. I think I'm going to like it very well."
1613,"Great price on sale. Would be 5 star if it had a card reader slot. The operating system is using 13.5GB of space leaving 18.5GB of useable space. Web camera is pretty bad, only 640x480. Great battery life. Nice size and weight, the 1080p, anti-glare, IPS screen is the best feature. Trackpad is nice and responsive. both USB-A ports seem tight and a bit cheap, but they work and otherwise I'm very happy so far with this Chromebook."
1614,"I have a desk top and a larger Chromebook.  This smaller one goes with me everywhere.  It is so lightweight that I can put it in a tote bag and have it on hand when I need it.  It's easy to use and when watching videos, the picture is fantastic.  (My cat loves watching bird videos on it, too.)  I bought this on a whim because of the low price, but would buy it again because it is such a good product."
1615,"I bought this chromebook for my husband because we just started homeschooling our middle schooler and we are doing a lot of research as we are about to invest a lot of time and money into a new farming business. It is perfect for using GoogleDocs, researching, watching youtube videos and creating and delivering lessons for our son. Web pages load quickly."
1616,"Pleasantly surprised by the display quality.  Resolution is decent and I really like the 1366 x 912 dimension -- I prefer it to 1366 x 768.  Processor is zippy.  I bought this as a Prime Days deal, and for $129 it was unbeatable. Even at the retail price of $199 is would be a good deal.  I definitely recommend this unit."
1617,I cannot turn on my computer. I’ve tried charging it but it won’t charge. I purchased this January 7 2021. I don’t use it often. I’m very disappointed with this product.
1618,"Bought this as our ""tv"" computer (we've never owned an actual tv) when our old Mac broke. It's simple, lightweight, battery lasts forever, and does exactly what I need it to do: connect to the internet and play shows off Netflix or whatever. Decent volume (we don't connect to any speakers) and good picture from all angles."
1619,This was perfect for me I no nothing about computers it was very easy set I was connected to my internet quickly I don’t really do gaming just really  looking around internet nothing to big this is perfect for me and perfect price
1620,This thing died and won't charge after ONE MONTH of very light use.  I maybe used it 5 times. The stupid thing is the battery cost $50....the Chromebook is only $80 right now. So absolutely frustrating. Piece of junk.
1621,"The machine was very easy to set up from my existing Google account.  I ported over MS Office 365 and added all my favorite apps in a few minutes.  I am more than happy with my choice.  This Chromebook is fast, has great battery life, and can do everything I need.  The keyboard lacks a ""delete"" key, which was awkward until I learned the shortcut workaround.  I highly recommend this item."
1622,"It's cheap, easy, small, and it does what I need it to do.  You want to browse the web and do word processing?  This is your machine, nothing spectacular, but it doesn't need to be.  This is your 'extra' laptop, the one you set in a room you don't use often or take with you somewhere because it doesn't matter if it breaks or not.  I'd say get it if you find that useful."
1623,"Of course, you have a very limited hard drive, but for email and browsing this laptop could not be any easier and it is very affordable.  I bought one for my mother and and identical one for me."
1624,"Needed a lightweight laptop for my night shift job and traveling, Acer has always been a great company this chrome-book is worth it  Great price , lightweight, fast and the volume is better than my 800$ laptop lol definitely would recommend!!!!"
1625,"What I like is the light weight, long battery life . I am still getting used to this machine and it is coming along nicely. As I travel it is also much better for me unlike my PC. Overall I am glad that I made the switch to a Chromebook."
1626,"Anyone looking at Chromebooks these days, and trying to choose one, is in for quite the ride.  So many to choose from, and at so many price points and feature sets."
1627,"This was purchased during the Amazon early access sale. It's a great basic, no frills Chromebook for the price. My daughter just needed something to apply for jobs and surf the net on. Google apps work great, and so far no issues at all."
1628,I first was going to return because of inadequate storage but after reading about it before even opening the box I knew I needed this computer. I love it does what I needed and more and as always with amazon arrived on time and packaged immaculately. Thanks Amazon L Bullard
1629,I have two older Acer chromebooks similar to this that I've been very satisfied.  Just started using this new one and everything has gone well.  It's really nice and performs well at a very affordable price.
1630,"I've had this 314 a few weeks now and find everything about it a joy. I ordered through Amazon US instead of Amazon Canada and got a better price--much better--than getting it in Canada. I did have a US gift card. On the first day, there was a slight screen flickering, and was about to return it but filled out a complaint form and sent it to Chrome--the flickering stopped--and hasn't returned. Just stopped. Feels so good to be free of Microsoft but use it sparingly when others need a doc in Word. None of those irritating Windows 10 updates."
1631,"after a year and a half, completely dead. Worked well for awhile, and it was inexpensive but I thought I’d get at least 3 years out of it.  Lesson learned"
1632,"Update to my review: This wasn't a hardware fail. It was an operator issue. There are settings for the machine that you access by clicking the TIME in the lower right corner. From there, look for mirror mode."
1633,"This Acer Chromebook 512 Laptop | Intel Celeron N4020 | 12"" HD+ Display | Intel UHD Graphics 600 has completely blown me away with how capable a low-priced Chrome OS laptop can be."
1634,"Really can't complain given what it does for the price, but a slightly annoying issue is with the power button.  Sometimes you have to hold it down to get the device to power up.  Otherwise no issues"
1635,"I returned the first one, the same model, because  the second monitor (HD TV) flickers or blacks out.  It wasn't the faulty C to HDMI connectors I have many of them."
1636,I bought this for my disabled vet spouse for Christmas 2021.  Here we are less than a year later and it's dead.  Won't turn on nothing.  I didn't buy any warranty so it's my fault and I don't expect anything but did expect it to last more than 11 months.  Can't afford another so he'll just have to go without.
1637,"I first purchased a Toshiba chromebook in 2015, it is still going strong.  Decided to update and I cannot fault this Acer version in any way.  Display size and resolution is great.  The majority of chromebooks on the market are HD.  But this version is full HD, there is a major difference between the two.  Bonus is that it is complete with both USB A and USB C inputs."
1638,"I’ve had this computer for six months, and over the last two months, it sometimes refused to charge when plugged in. I replaced the charger, and walked through the battery reset with tech support (which I am about to do, yet again). My older two children have older Acer laptops that aren’t giving us issues, but I am pretty disappointed in this one."
1639,"I had an Acer 15.6, which I liked quite a bit but I've had it several years and it was starting to rundown.  I then purchased an 11.6 (I think) and I found it to be too small.  Returned it and ordered this.  I love it.  More lightweight that 15.6, fast , screen is beautiful (HD), keyboard is fine.  No complaints at all.  Very, very happy.  Ever since I got my first Chromebook I was sold."
1640,"While not top of the line, it does the job nicely and provides better value than anything I could find on Amazon in its class. It's worth noting that the first one I received had a dead pixel near the center of the screen, but Amazon was excellent in getting me another one quickly."
1641,"Huge disappointment from the very beginning, setup prosses. Simply didn't work. When called tech support, the SIND number couldn't be recognized. Spend about 45 min. waiting to be connected  and it never happened. Just waste of time and money."
1642,What I received was not what was described. What I received was a run of the mill chrome book and not a spin 311. Also does not have a touchscreen.
1643,"My god this is the first time having an awful experience buying something here and I hope its the last, this was completely ridiculous and absurd. Simply put, I was sent this Chromebook WITH NO CHROME OS. You might as well sent me no screen or no motherboard cause it'd be just as useful, will be returning and purchasing something more fitting for my tastes, a working laptop."
1644,"Just purchased in August and have to send it back because it will not power on. Had to purchase another power cord, because the one it came with died. It's fully charged & will not come on. Called the customer support... Did everything they told me to... Now have to send it in so they can tear it apart and erase everything on it and send it back... NOT HAPPY!!!"
1645,"Our kids have used this product for less than 2 months to do their school work on. Didn't have any issues until it suddenly wouldn't charge at all anymore, or even turn on. Tried out varying charging cables and outlets, with no success."
1646,"I would not recommend buying this because after 30 days of using it, it has turned into a tablet forever. It will not go back into its laptop form. I contacted the seller and he is refusing to help me."
1647,"At a cost of about 200 bucks the Acer Chromebook is a bargain. Does all the things you’d expect plus it is very light, the touch screen is responsive and the screen resolution is good. Not my primary tool, but very useful, kinda like a utility infielder."
1648,"I bought this for a friend, easy set up, just type your Google email and everything is already there, when u login its very fast, i like the touchscreen feature, u can used it as a tablet too, its well build, the size it perfect, not to big not too small,  i was on the whole day and the battery did not die on me, in fact i still have a lot of juice left. the only complaint i have is i regret not buying 2 for that price."
1649,The laptop has heating problem. The switch between tablet mode and laptop is not smooth. The mouse pad is really bad. The laptop freezes just while watching netflix option for the price. Wont recommend to anyone
1650,"Money is tight everywhere. I thought I would give this Spin 311 a try for reference of a future purchase, then return it. However, wow. I have been stunned into realizing how slow my previous Chromebooks were. This one is fast, with a nice sharp clean feel to the keys. Bright clear screen. It loaded all my previous items within no time. The wi-fi is even noticeably faster and more efficient than my previous laptops. No. No this one is staying with me. I hope to buy a second one soon. My Wife deserves better as well."
1651,The delivery however sucks. Twice now it has been left in the  sun at 100+ degrees. The product wouldn't turned on one day and the next didn't turn on at all. I asked for someone to knock or if i could pick it up at a ups place when delivering the replacement. i know how the product works because i used a friends.
1652,"I did a lot of research as to what to get for my kids to replace their aging and damaged Samsung Tab A's. We decided that it was time to go to a Chromebook so that they could get more repetition with a standard keyboard and GoogleOS. They are still able to download all the PlayStore apps that they had on their tablets, but now with better hardware and longer support."
1653,The ACER Spin 311 is the answer from ACER to the Lenovo C340 11inch which was a great success story. Acer obviously wanted a share of the pie and thus the birth of Spin 311.
1654,"Normally my husband (IT guy) writes these reviews, but I wanted to write this one.  We are currently starting the new 2020-2021 school year 100% virtual.  My daughter (5th grade) has used Chromebooks at school for a couple of years now.  My son is younger (2nd grade), and  this is his first experience with them."
1655,"I really like the Chromebook concept.  They don't need too much power, rely mostly on the web browser, and aren't super complicated in terms of too many apps or bloatware.  I especially like how small and light this one is.  It makes it perfect for a young person as an airplane movie machine or as their first schoolwork notebook computer."
1656,It does not fold! It opens and closes but doesn't do the same as it shows in the pictures or as it says in the description...it is a regular Acer laptop....
1657,"The screen was actually better than I expected, with good touch sensitivity and crispness.  The camera is good quality as well.  Overall build quality appears quite solid, better than I expected.  Look, it's a Chromebook, which are basically commodities at this point, and it does the job we use it for - surfing the web, Zoom calls, YouTube streaming, and an occasional low-memory game.  I will say that it feels better in the hands (heavier, better screen) than our prior Samsung Chromebook, which felt plastic-y and light."
1658,like that it is wireless..so much easier than moving laptop around due to connections.. free to use anywhere in the home...  not stuck to a short wire connect any more. so nice
1659,"This is probably the best priced touchscreen Chromebook on the market.  While there are upgrade potentials to more premium models, this one has no glaring deficiencies and works really well for all the standard Chrome OS functions including video.  The touchscreen allows for better Android app manipulation especially in tablet mode."
1660,Stopped working after a 14 months! What a waste of money. When I called the 800 number for help I was told to buy another battery and that should fix my problem.
1661,"I loved this laptop, but after about a month of having it, it just completely stopped turning on. I tried recharging it and it still didn’t work. I don’t know what happened to it, but the seller was kind enough to give me my return."
1662,For some odd reason when I'm watching a movie or on an app it'll start skipping or I'll have to force restart. It doesn't work well for the smallest task.
1663,"This has survived summer camp and beach vacations on the RV with a 9 year old. I didn't buy any type of case, he just carries it in his backpack. It's very durable and the battery lasts until bedtime, sometimes later. If you're wondering, it's been dropped and wet multiple times but I would not recommend testing it's limits. If your kid is tough on electronics I'd at least get the gorilla glass screen protector."
1664,"Bought this primarily for my son to use for school (Zoom calls). Initially we were having trouble on Zoom. Screen sharing wasn't working. Call would drop. Couldn't use the 2nd monitor via Thunderbolt while doing Zoom. Did some testing and discovered the wifi was getting an abismal bandwidth score. I purchased a TP Link USB to Ethernet adapter, doubled the internet bandwidth, and the issues went a way."
1665,"Bought this on an amazon prime sale, about 20-30 less than ""normal"".  Looked up lots of reviews on here and various sites, and decided to go for it.  It's a fairly quick little computer that we use mainly for browsing the web (my kids online learning games, netflix, disney plus, etc.)."
1666,"Computer worked very well for about a month or so then just wouldn’t do anything, customer service is at best comical. Feel like I wasted my money and would have been better to go to Walmart"
1667,"used it for about a month before it stopped turning on completely, i lost all my artwork and pictures saved on there. it would crash in the middle if drawings and was altogether glitchy and not worth the money. i wish i just went with a higher end one"
1668,Chromebook stopped working in just over one month of use and with very light use. Shut down while in use and will not power back on. Battery still had over 90% life left.
1669,Wanted to love this so much but both the original and replacement had the exact same issue with the screen going dark immediately after turning on. Acer support was a joke... It's just someone with no IT experience reading off a script. Getting a refund when what I really wanted was a computer.
1670,This is by far the best chrome book! It looks brand new and is easy to use! I would recommend this for everyone. I never expected it to be this good.
1671,Working then not. Left in car due to rain inna case. Woke up and at work it fell apart. Screen burned/no response didn't work. Keys dell off like melted into nothing. Most melted off a few warped and a couple intact wth. I want my money back. Doubt they will give me anything or more. I just want a working latop not a crazy job thanks.
1672,"I got this laptop two months ago and it has some major crashing issues. It will randomly close an app while I’m on it, or have a loading symbol indefinitely. It also has very little storage capacity."
1673,"Perfect work and play laptop for my daughter. With remote learning she needed something compact and sturdy. This laptop holds a charge for a very long time. As with all chromebooks, setup is a breeze. The touch functionality is very responsive and the ability for my daughter to download games from the play store and use this as a tablet is a bonus. Highly recommend. This is my second purchase, my son has one that has been working perfectly fine for some time now. Highly recommend."
1674,This is my first Chromebook. I was not sure what to expect. I love it. It is much better than an android tablet in my opinion. The convertible feature along with a real keyboard is perfect for a lightweight device. The Chromebook itself is speedy. It feels even faster than a brand new android tablet.
1675,"I upgraded my tablet to this amazing computer because I didn't want to carry both around when it was no longer necessary. The processor makes this fast and it has impressive storage and graphics. The laptop is also sturdy and well-constructed while being lightweight. I am primarily working from home but when I have meetings, etc it is so nice to have everything right at my fingertips in this one dope computer. The convertible function is well-designed and touch screen is responsive. I love everything about it and it has become my primary mobile workstation!"
1676,"This is my third Acer Chromebook, the previous two Acer's gave me years of reliable service and never failed to perform when needed. The only reason for upgrading was for additional power and longer battery life, both previous Chromebooks serve as backups if need be."
1677,"This is an excellent chromebook. It is fast, the touch screen works perfectly, and it seamlessly switches from laptop to tablet mode when you flip it over. Screen quality is great - videos are crisp and clear. The speakers are terrible - I can barely hear the volume when trying to watch a movie while doing dishes. Headphones pair with no issue."
1678,This was bought as a gift so I can only relay the comments from the older gentleman for whom this was purchased.  The big complaint was the letter on the keyboard were printed in loser case.  He grumbled about touch screen a bit but as he got used to chromebook verses his laptop he has given it some praise.  Can't really give any details as I don't pay much attention to his grumbles.
1679,"I loved this little Chromebook, but it was not the product I should have ordered. I couldn't use it for work. My fault of course. The reason I gave it one star is because I had to return it and I haven't received a refund although it says it was received May 10th. What gives?"
1680,"The laptop is very fragile it fell and was destroyed in a minute I suggest if you’re purchasing make sure and the protective case and screen, also the manufacturers are thieves they’re charging the same amount you paid for the laptop to fix the screen this doesn’t make any sense"
1681,"Bought this to replace my wife's aging Asus chromebook which was no longer supported by chromeOS updates.  This is almost identical in looks, although larger screen size and much better battery life as well as a faster processor make it a really good upgrade that should last for a good while.  Love the touchscreen and the tablet mode.  The video quality leaves a bit to be desired but for a 200 dollar unit i can't complain.  My wife loves it and that's the best part :)"
1682,"This chromebook is very much worth the money, I bought it for college and it has been very quick and hasn’t had any performance issues. I highly recommend this laptop to any upcoming college students who need a reliable device for taking notes and doing classwork."
1683,"Bought this for my daughter to use at school. She loved it while it worked, but after a year and a month the WiFi hardware died. Acer wanted to charge almost as much as the original purchase price to repair the hardware. No more Acer products for us."
1684,Loved this device when it was working! I purchased in May 2021 and it will not charge January 2022.  Tried two different chargers of which I had the same result.
1685,"Got this for elementary school children. I've never owned a chromebook so didn't know what to expect, but so far it has impressed me.  Easy to setup with a google account.  Also like how you can apply parental controls using google family.  As far as the device itself-- love the touchscreen.  My kids don't really use the flipped mode but i like that it is an option.  Very happy with my purchase.  Also, I didn't buy the extended protection but am now thinking I will."
1686,Seemingly very attractive computer however after four months it went dark - it failed at three months and then again at four months - and they do not give your money back or a new one. Do not buy a waste of money and very aggravating. They make you send it back at $25 shipping cost now I’m out for two weeks with no computer.
1687,I’ve been using it all day to make sure everything works properly. Both the display and audio work perfectly and the battery has lasted all day. The touch screen works great.
1688,"Locked up while on my banks website. Would not reboot. Tried a few days later after the battery died. Nothing. Shame because I was Chromebook would provide secure banking. Also, a lot of banks do not have apps for Chromebook. And using external storage is made intentionally difficult for no reason."
1689,"Bought this for my Daughter on her Birthday in 2020 because she needed a Chromebook for the School Year starting in September... Worked fine then the Charger stopped charging... Bought a replacement Charger Because of course, the return window had expired..."
1690,"After just 3 months, the Chromebook is became unresponsive. The power LED does not even light up with three different chargers. Acer provides warranty repair only with 5-10 days turn-around and shipping cost is on us. We've enjoyed their products in the past, but this will be the last Acer product we've bought. They clearly don't stand behind their products."
1691,"This chromebook has been great so far. It is far more durable than most chromebooks on the market. I love that it is small but is still just as good, if not better than the bigger chromebooks. The touchpad is great and the keys have a nice feel when typing. All around great chromebook so far."
1692,"I bought this to use for school, because it can run all the apps I would otherwise be using on my phone. It definitely gets the job done. The ONLY thing I would improve is not specifically related to this laptop, but to the variety of apps that are available for it."
1693,Please be aware that this product is not the Spin model.  I received mine at is the Acer 311 (not the Spin).  I was finally sent a shipping level and returning and promised a full refund.  It was received brand new.  It's simply not the model that is shown.
1694,"i bought this is February 2021 for my brother is Florida and im in michigan, hes not tech savy and i just drove down to visit and I can not get this to work. it refuses to do anything but say error i dpon t know why. we have in my home at the moment 4 chromebooks so im quite aware of their capabilities. i need to return it but i cant.  they need to make it right,."
1695,"All the Google apps that I always love come standard on every Chromebook, which means I can edit, download, and convert Microsoft Office files in Google Docs, Sheets and Slides.  I am so happy I ordered this laptop."
1696,"This was supposed to have an Intel Celeron 4020 popCPU, but instead has a worse Mediatek CPU. I would return it, but it's for a gift and I wouldn't get a replacement in time"
1697,"You can’t edit Microsoft Office 365 online, super frustrating! You cannot print from this device either!! So frustrating and worst purchase ever!! If you don’t need to edit or print then you might be just fine."
1698,"I tried to purchase a Chromebook much like this one from a different seller because it was cheaper. Well, the webcam didn't work so I bought from Acer directly and the laptop is perfect! I use it for school and it gets everything done (except respondus lockdown browser). I recommend it for anyone looking for a reliable lap top. (Ignore the bubbles in my screen protector, I know theyre bad) lol"
1699,"This is my second Acer Chrome Book but the performance doesn't compare to my first Acer purchased 4 years ago  THe second Acer has difficulty loading apps and must continually be re-booted.  It also loses the wifi connections, sometimes repeatedly in a two or three minute time span.  So sorry I didn't review this product more carefully before purchasing."
1700,"This is exactly what you need if you want the flexibility of a 180 hinge so you can move to tablet mode at any time.  Operation is smooth, screen is outstanding.  I tried a 2 n 1 tablet thinking it would work but even with a quad processor it is so slow and the battery lasted 1.45min.  This battery lasts 7-10 hours, full chromebook so very fast, and the 180 hinge makes it perfect.  If you are looking for this type of tablet you cannot go wrong here.  Very happy."
1701,"I had bought one for my son and I liked his, so I bought one for myself. The battery life lasts about 2 days with me and everything that I do on it. The screen quality is amazing. It's nice and clear. Plus I can fold it how I need it for the different projects I work on. I just wish mine came with a pen like my son's did."
1702,"Bought while taking a few medical courses for online test taking and word processing and it works great for travel. Screen is very clear, bezels are a little too big however it lasts for near 14 hours of class without needing a charge which is impressive. Charges fast off any USBC you have laying around. Speakers aren’t great but wearing headphones is great for watching Netflix/YouTube at night. Overall if you need a small word processor I highly recommend it."
1703,"I bought this for my 5 year old kindergartener to use for her Zoom classroom. This Acer Chromebook can NOT handle Zoom. Zoom gets cut off, freezes....etc. extremely frustrating. FYI we have 400 MB/S download speed internet. Also, we don’t have these issues when using Zoom with our MacBooks."
1704,"Tore up in 4 days of use will no longer charge at all, even after purchasing new charger it doesn't work got my daughter this for Christmas and she is heart broken over it not working!"
1705,"This thing was garbage.  Set it up for my son, he used it a day then we got a CgromeOS is damaged message.  Recovered the OS and he used it for school today.  Now the piece of junk won’t charge.  A week out of the return window so now we will have to wait for Acer to fix it.  Skip this one."
1706,"My daughter has had this laptop for 3 months and it has already stopped working. I am very disappointed as this was not only a school investment but an investment for her small business, as well. This really sucks."
1707,"I picked this one up for the grandson, he's going to a hire grade figured it was time for an up grade. The Chromebook is a nice looking piece of equipment, solidly build, the screen is tough and the touch screen is great.  I set it up to see how it works, absolutely a worthwhile investment.  Looks good, works great, the grandson is happy what more could you ask for."
1708,the listing reads as if it has internal wifi capabilities - NO - just like any modern tablet it will connect to a wifi network but does not help if there is secure network and you do not have password - duh - thought i could add data plan and have hotspot
1709,"This is the second chromebook ive bought off Amazon, I love it that much.  Perfect for presenting in meetings or appts for work.  Lightweight so I can throw it in my purse and go.  Definitely recommend"
1710,"This Chromebook is NOT touch screen and does NOT spin or bend at all. It bends 180° at most, a straight line, and nothing further. I spent to much money for it not to have the basic description of the product!"
1711,We needed a cheap laptop just for browser usage. We have an employee that occasionally needs to do light work on a computer and so we got this for those cases. It has worked perfectly for that purpose. It's very nice that it's convertible into basically a tablet. We use it both ways all the time now!
1712,"I got this as an inexpensive Touch screen for my mom,  She is able to use it very easily,  we are able to use whats app for facetime and she can do her banking and other minimal internet activities with no issue.  for her use there was no reason to spend a lot more on a surface or Ipad"
1713,"Even though it takes a stylus to work the touch screen, and though the battery life isn't as advertised (10 hours, maybe it's more like six if you aren't using it heavily, I love this Chromebook.  It does everything I need to do -- with freedom from Microsoft, whose subscription plan felt a bit like a noose to me.  Mostly I surf, do social media, buy online, email, but I can use Google Documents if I need to write something.  Basically I love this product and I liked the price very much!"
1714,"The first chrome book I was sent had a black bar the would randomly show up & was super slow after 2 days of using it. I asked for a replacement & since getting my replacement, it’s better. A bit slow on the typing here & there but over all great for school work & no black bar randomly showing up."
1715,"I'm so happy I made this purchase!  I ordered two Chromebooks prior to ordering the Acer Spin 311 and returned them due to dissatisfied. When I received this one, I was totally satisfied.  I watched two movies that were over a hour and a half each and still had over 95% battery left!  The screen is great and I love the keyboard. It turns into a tablet and stands up perfectly!!  I highly recommend!!"
1716,"Purchased on June 27, 2020. Stopped powering on in early January 2021. Tried resetting but no luck. Worked reasonably well for six months, but when I contacted the manufacturer they just sent a generic email telling me my only option is for me to pay to ship it (insured) to them with no timeline for repair. Wanted to like this product but don't feel great about buying another Acer now."
1717,"Really impressed with Chrome OS and its ease of use - it is like having an Android-powered phone, almost eliminating any type of learning curve. With the required Google account, all items synchronize across the various desktops, Chromebooks, and phones we have in use. Easy to add accessories and plenty powerful for everyday work."
1718,The Chrome book is wonderful for streaming tv. I think it would be a great device fir first-timrts and children to learn on. I bought it so I could stream my favorites when I travel.
1719,"Within weeks of the end of the warranty it simply would no longer charge and eventually died. I tried all the tricks and event opened it up and disconnected the battery, but there is simply no life in it. I see from the reviews that others have had similar issues. Just a super cheap unit, not recommended."
1720,"I bought this for my husband to use as a small laptop. He doesn't wish to use this as a tablet. Unfortunately the screen will rotate sideways while he's using and it's a struggle to get the screen back to the correct way. I do not recommend this product if you wish to use as a laptop only. I would return, but unfortunately we're outside of our return time. :("
1721,"For being such an inexpensive laptop this Acer Chromebook Spin 311 Convertible Laptop is a great choice for a child! I got this for my 9 year old and he has had it for about 9 months now, and he genuinely uses this just as much as his iPad and our desktop computer."
1722,"I love this laptop! I needed something light for basic tasks such as work, streaming, and casual games, and it is perfect for those tasks!. I love the fact that ChromeOS syncs with my Google account and all of my stuff is right here."
1723,"I love the chrome book because I get to use it as a tablet and the touchscreen works well for me, I can put in my hand bag because it’s not to big and everything works well I love it❤️"
1724,"used this computer about 5 weeks and stopped working.  Sounds like faulty connection between charger and computer so now I need to pack up this computer, send it back to ACER and wait 5-10 business days for them to repair this.  I am responsible for the cost of sending the machine to the facility.  Wow, thought I would at least get a few years service from a computer before I had a problem"
1725,bought at $249.00 Respectable specs for price given current demand. Getting 8+ hours of battery life surfing web and watching YouTube. If you cant tell from pics. micro SD slot reader for media and volume rocker on side. your play store app compatibly will vary. please note that only about 20 GB of that storage is available for apps. if you are new to Chromebooks (or computers in general) this is more of a tablet+ than a full laptop replacement
1726,"So far so good. I only use it a couple of hours a day, and I can go the whole week without having to recharge the battery. Screen is good given the price point, touch screen has been solid, and the 360 degree hinge is much nicer than I thought it would be. I find myself using the hinge, and touch screen much more than I thought I would. Screen size is a little small sometimes, but more often than not it isn't an issue."
1727,"I got this to use around the house and I just love it. Fast and clear, the touchscreen works very well and the battery life is better than expected. I was also surprised by the sound quality. Good machine!"
1728,"Great computer for kids and school however after just one year there seems to be a hardware problem and the computer died. Since it was out of warranty after one year, to get it looked at would cost same as if I  purchased it!"
1729,"Light weight and boots up quickly. Timed it and it took me less than 44 seconds from the point of turning it on, logging in and started to browse the internet compared to nearly 5 minutes for my Dell windows laptop. Happy with this purchase."
1730,"The product I ordered is listed on the website as CP311-2H-C679. I received instead the product CP311-3H-K3WL (marked as such on the box and the back of the PC itself). This model K2WL uses a different chipset (MediaTek instead of the Intel Celeron 4020). This impacts negatively the performance of the unit SIGNIFICANTLY. Moreover, it has fewer USB ports than the C679 product."
1731,"I was so looking forward to using this Chromebook. I am housebound, and with Covid 19, I am in isolation as well. Not as bad as it may sound, since I live with my son and his family."
1732,Christmas present for my 8 year old. She loves it. I can still remember the look on her face when she found out it was not only touchscreen but could also fold and be used as a tablet!
1733,I wanted to get a new table to play games through google play store.  Much to my surprise this is a computer and tablet all in one.  Set up in minutes and away I was playing my games.  Can't beat the price and/or the product.  I am do please with this purchase!!!!!
1734,This item is just as described. I really like that you can do the keyboard or the touchscreen. It has a great batter life and is easy to carry around.
1735,Had to send it back.  Would not retain a password and then any app added would disappear.  Acer said that the only thing they could do was a factory reset.  We had to change Google password 4 times and it never worked.  We’ve had an Acer tablet before and never had any trouble.  Now it’s messed up things on the regular computer.  Probably have to get someone more computer savy than me.  Ordered an iPad.
1736,"I wasn't sure what to expect since this is my first Chromebook outside of what the school provided my child for classwork.  We moved to a new school and had to supply our own.  This cost less than what the old school used and is far more responsive and includes a touch screen (old school's was not touch).  My 14-year-old boy was extremely impressed, as was I.  I don't have any knowledge of the battery life yet (nor complaints from the boy)."
1737,"I had 2 of these units, the first just stopped working - would not turn on would not show any signs of charging or power at all after using for about 2 weeks."
1738,"good for the price .. touchscreen need a slightly harder press than other manufacturers, camera is kind of dark . i love the spin but wondering how long those hinges will last lol"
1739,"Nothing really to review. It’s been dead or with Acer for “repairs” longer than we’ve actually had it. Right in the middle of remote learning too! Customer service was essentially a human doing a robot’s job, i.e. scripted and mostly useless."
1740,"Bought this for my granddaughter but found out she couldn't use it for schoolwork. I kept it, and it's OK for what I use it for. Still haven't explored everything it can do so will update my review later"
1741,Love the convenience of the tablet but I have had to purchase two replacement chargers since purchasing the tablet. It does not charge anymore. Chargers work with my other devices but do not charge the tablet anymore.
1742,"Bought this for my kindergarteners “covid classes” we have at home  instead of in class lessons! Works great.. we were having issues using a regular computer/ mouse cuz I think he’s used to using a touch screen on his tablet, so we invested! Have no complaints so far and would recommend it to any elementary age child for zoom classes/ online classes that they may need to participate in!"
1743,"This Acer Chromebook Spin is awesome. I love technology and chrome books are so much fun to play with. This one would be great for work, school, or just browsing/playing games. It easily turns in to tablet and tent mode, making watching movies a breeze. It's made from durable plastic and seems super sturdy. Small and light, this will fit in any backpack, bag, or briefcase."
1744,This device is much quicker to “wake up” than my laptop. It does everything I need a PC to do and it is super convenient that it also functions as a tablet.
1745,"Review for: Acer Chromebook Spin 311 Convertible Laptop | Intel Celeron N4000 | 11.6"" HD Touch Corning Gorilla Glass Display | 4GB LPDDR4 | 64GB eMMC | Intel 802.11ac Gigabit WiFi 5 | Chrome OS | CP311-2H-C7QD"
1746,"Light, long battery life, quick boot, excellent alternative for those who feel it's too heavy and short battery life for Laptop, long booting time for windows, but not sufficient if merely bring along with iPad or smart phone."
1747,"This works pretty well if you are just going to be web browsing or watching some videos. It's a bit slow in terms of installing/running apps. But I find it's small size, lightweight and good battery life make it very convenient to use when you don't really want to haul around a full size laptop. I might in the future consider spending a little bit more for a faster processor. But that's about the only criticism I have for this."
1748,This laptop is so great! It meets my needs and more! And you can't beat the price for the neat perks it offers! I especially love that it's convertible AND touchscreen! Highly recommend!
1749,"This Acer Chromebook (TheSpin 311 Convertible) has a long-lasting battery, which is an absolute necessity for younger kids. However, it comes loaded with junk, some of which isn't usable or is outdated. We've been using it for a few days and, of course, the kids love the touch screen, and taking photos. Although, there's little comparison to a regular PC that my10-year-old grandson is using. And it's different enough to be confusing. It is, after all, a Chromebook."
1750,"The item they ship is not what is described or shown.  They are aware of this.  However, they will not notify you they are not shipping what you think you are buying.  This does not have a touch screen and does not fold back as shown.  I would give no stars if possible"
1751,This review is for the Acer Chromebook Spin 311 4GB/30GB. it looks pretty.  It's fine for light use like internet browsing or bill paying or shopping.  But at this price point I consider it a fail with only one usb and no micro sd card slot.  Considering that the price should be around $80.  It has bluetooth so would be great to load music on it and play that through bluetooth speakers.  To bad you can't.
1752,"So first thing, since I know some people will be wondering: this device CAN NOT be flashed to run Windows or Linux, at least at this time.  It is not possible.  Was one of the main reasons I got it, since I did not know that at the time, but I will make do, ChromeOS is workable nowadays.  If you want a Chromebook to flash to Ubuntu or Windows or something, there are websites that break down which can and which can't."
1753,"In less than two months my Acer stopped working, it gradually stopped charging and I  wonder what is wrong. This Acer is heavier than the similar Samsung that I bought thre years ago, but the Samsung chrome has never been troubling. It is the one I reverted to."
1754,"Me gusta todo. Su tamaño, el diseño ( la puedo usar como laptop y también como tableta). La quise comprar porque la laptop que tengo en par de horas ya esta la batería descargada y ahora tengo más tiempo de carga y muchas más velocidad para realizar mis tareas. Estoy encantado con la acer. Espero que me dure mucho tiempo. La recomiendo al 100%."
1755,I ordered it for my daughter for her to take online classes from camp and school. We are very happy with this chromebook. it is also touch screen and can be folded like a book so easier for her to use when reading books. We are able to install all needed apps to complete her work.
1756,"I would not recommend buying this from Amazon.  We have had this computer for less than a month, it has been dead for 2 days and the battery will not take a charge/power up.  We contacted Acer and we would have to send it back for a ""repair"" that could take up to 2 weeks.  This is my son's school computer.  Such a hassle and Acer customer service isn't great."
1757,"Fantastic all around 2 in 1 laptop!  Smaller screen than my ancient dysfunctional laptop but a far better replacement.  It isn't built for serious gaming though, and the screen could be bigger given the wide margin between the display and the edge of the laptop.  I imagine Acer did that on purpose to make the display more rugged and less prone to damage.  If that's the case, I have zero complaints."
1758,We purchased this for my step-daughter and she loves it. We added YouTubeTV app so she can enjoy streaming TV in her bedroom and it works GREAT!  We're very happy with this Chromebook. It does everything that we need it to do.
1759,"battery is great. the chromebook works mostly like a laptop and kinda like an android. screen quality is kinda low but not bad, touch screen is nice and doesnt lag with any touch. love it"
1760,"So far. So good. Bought it for my 8yo, but end up using it for myself! Love the touch screen features. Zero lag. My only complaint is, the screen saver that came on it seems to be something another user would put? So I’m thinking this might be a used computer?"
1761,I love it I've never had a laptop or a tablet this is a two-in-one I've actually been addicted to it since I got it and the deliverer dropped it at my door and sent me a picture saying it was there
1762,I like that this product was easy to sign in for and works without much intervention.  I set up a few apps and am enjoying the exposure to the Android/Google world.
1763,I love this chromebook! I csn use it as a tablet or a laptop! The touch screen is a great feature. I take courses on line with it and do alot of emailing and zoom.
1764,"You get what you paid for. I thought I liked it originally, but the more I use it, the more I realize how slow the laptop is compared to my Macbook Air 2015. Granted, the Macbook Air costs 4x more, but I came to a point where the Chromebook just felt unusable and more like a starter laptop for my 9-year old kid."
1765,This is a nice lightweight Chromebook and it works great. I have a very strong internet signal so I am not having some of the problems I read about. Its fast. Set up took 5 minutes.
1766,Figuring out how to use it has been difficult.  Instructions are non existent and my intuitiveness is failing me. I can’t even figure out how to add and app or it’s icon
1767,"I haven’t used it for long but when I did it was easy to set up, light weight and I love that it’s touch screen, and can be reversed to a tablet."
1768,"I searched forever looking at chrome books for my 11 year old I wasn’t really sure what to buy, I finally decided to go with this one and I am glad that I did ! I didn’t want to spend a fortune but wanted something that was going to last and work well for him! This is so easy to use and he loves it haven’t came across anything we didn’t like yet!"
1769,I am used to having bigger screen and was worried if it will not work for me. I got it and made some adjustments and I can see really well on it
1770,"This is my second chromebook, both are the Acer brand.  I really enjoy the security, the ease of use, and the touchscreen.  I keep it next to my recliner and grab it several times a day to check the news, do some research, some shopping, or read up on email etc.  So glad I decided to give the chromebook a try."
1771,"So I gave the stars simply because the chromebook arrived DOA (dead on arrival) and that ticks me off when I buy high end or high dollar electronics!! Other than that it arrived on time, NIB (new in box) but had to charge before we could play around with it!"
1772,I expected to like this just fine but I really like it more than I expected to. And huge kudos to the seller. Shipping was even faster than it was estimated to be.
1773,"Love the Chromebook! Touchscreen is great. Only negative is that the speakers are not very loud but you can use Bluetooth to connect another, louder speaker d so it's not a big deal for me. Very affordable!"
1774,This is a very nice computer for the price I have had no complaints and it has given me 0 trouble I really like all the functions on this computer it can be turned into a tablet also and it has a touch screen you really can't go wrong with this computer
1775,"Just got my computer today and started doing my thing, quickly noticed a small crack at the top which if it’s a brand new computer it really shouldn’t have that, so far no other things have come up but I will be in contact."
1776,"This is a fantastic device.  We got it for my son for digital learning.  It’s easy to use, fast, and has great features.  The price is amazing too!  I would highly recommend this chrome book."
1777,"This is a replacement of a Chromebook from 2017, my only complaint is printing. This one does not go directly to print I wants you to save and not being savvy with electronics this is unsatisfactory for me. Other than that I love the device"
1778,"I purchased two of these, one for each of my boys and I'm extremely happy with them. Boys are hard on things and they have held up well. They work extremely well for the remote learning and college classes as well as their high School classes. Very impressed. Think I will buy one for myself now."
1779,"Update:  Did a little searching on my own and found Chrome Perks.  100 GB still available, but no longer to people who have taken advantage of it in the past with a previous Chromebook purchase.  Not happy about it, but it appears to be Google's greed that is the problem.  That said I think that the description on Amazon should be amended to not promise 100 gb of cloud storage.  I would be willing to bet most Chromebook buyers have already used the perk in the past."
1780,Love it and I am still getting used to it.  I don't like games etc on the computer I use for books and personal business so I bought  one like this as my old one died.  Works very well.
1781,I love it so far. Use it every single day. I guess I’m just a little confused because here it says the product is the Acer spin chrome book 311-2h-c629 or whatever but I definitely received the 311-3h-k23x
1782,"I purchased this about a year ago and I still use it. It works like new, I caught it on sale and the touchscreen is so useful! It came exactly like I had hoped."
1783,My first laptop or tablet I've had.  I had no knowledge of either and this was so easy to get used to.  Called the tech support number who helped me to get going and I'm off to the races.  Love this Chromebook!!  It is so nice and battery holds 10 hours.  Totally satisfied!  Putting the 2 in 1 works amazing
1784,I bought this for my 6 year old for school because they went virtual for 2020-2021 school year. I only had this maybe three months and it completely stopped working. Wouldn’t turn on anymore. So I wasted almost $300. Never will purchase from this company again!!
1785,"Exactly what I wanted, a smaller size laptop.  I got a bargain on it and am Really impressed with it. I’m not used to android but I’m getting there.  I mostly watch movies and it never has disappointed. Keeps charge plus charges up rapidly. Overall I love it!!"
1786,Love this laptop. I'm getting to know my way around the Chromebook OS and find it pretty easy. Never have a problem with battery. Touch pad and screen are smooth and responsive. The only issue so far is a flickering issue while streaming and opened Amazon app. The Amazon app flickered badly.
1787,"Worked great for 6 months, then just stopped working for no apparent reason.  Never dropped it or exposed it to water.  Always kept in a soft carrying case when not in use."
1788,"My daughter is very happy with this chromebook. I only purchased a new chromebook for her because her previous one is no longer going to get updates because it's ""too old""."
1789,Wow the advertisement was all wrong.I just got it in the mail today and there is no touch screen or the 4 different modes you can adjust it to.Very disappointing
1790,My child works in Canvas for her virtual school platform and this works well for her.  It was well worth the money and this is the third Acer Chromebook we have in the family.  We love them all!
1791,This Chromebook is the best purchase I made for myself in the past year. My HP Chromebook gave out on me and doesn't do half the things this one does. It's more sleek and lightweight. Also it's convertible and has good screen quality. Folds like a tablet and easy to connect the WiFi.
1792,"I like the fact that it is difficult, not impossible to get malware, and can be easily cleaned if you know where to go. I had a continual popup and discovered that although the operating system didn't have a virus/adware/malware, the browser did. Once I figured this out I cleared browser history and it was gone. I do not really like the Chrome operating system, but I suppose I will get used to it. Really like the near non-existent virus/malware. No need for anti-virus. Everything is run in a sandbox."
1793,"This was a gift for my partner. I set it up for him, and added the apps he wanted. This version of the Chromebook was easy to set up. The hardware seems sturdy, it survived a long road trip and a few air travel trips."
1794,"I'm 72 and have been agonizing replacing my aging Asus laptop. Back and forth between a Chromebook or a laptop. Read reviews on the differences, threw a dart, and ordered this Chromebook. What a great decision. Opened it up, plugged it in and turned it on. Then answered a few questions and it synched with my Note8. I like to cook and can hardly wait to look up a recipe, tent it, and start creating.  I have very simple computer needs, email, banking, and, looking up recipes. For me this is a 5."
1795,"This is listed on the website as CP311-2H-C679, but is really a CP311-3H-K23X (says so on the box).  The difference is 3H-K23X uses a different chipset (MediaTek vs Intel).  While this change saves battery life it also impacts the performance of the unit SIGNIFICANTLY (particularly when used for internet calls, aka zoom calls, as the graphics processor was downgraded in tandem).  This device is only suitable for LIGHT browsing and low-quality video/zoom calls.  It'll probably handle youtube playback if you're not doing anything else."
1796,"ACER is A+ 5 Star, touchscreen, has good keybooard, the battery last only for a day; u need to recharge it everyday.  My student graduated using ACER.  /  [On the other hand, the other product Tango has no external keyboard (I bought x2 nothing works and they made it hard to return; and I was unable to; bad customer support); i have to buy an externa keyboard for this Tango from entirely different company.  I am writing now at my Tango [this still works as secondary tablet]; because my son still has his ACER."
1797,"Bought this for my grand-daughter after being disappointed with another Chromebook purchase.  She was specific about the features she wanted.  Its being used for several hours at least 5 days per week, and is working satisfactorily since it was received."
1798,"Honestly I didn't know it was a tablet with a keyboard. I thought this was a mini laptop. Make sure you know that. The screen doesn't take up the whole screen area and the display is only 720p. You can't run steam, or the epic games launcher. So no CSGO during your lunch break. Apart from those points the screen feels well made and the keyboard and touch pad are ok. Overall its ok."
1799,"nice and small, quick enough for small and common tasks like email, texting, browsing and movie/music streaming. screen is clear, great keyboard and sound is good for the price. would buy again for sure"
1800,"I've had this 1 day. Charged it, powered it up, got a walk-through of the set up. It already knows my Google settings including bookmarks and passwords, and frequently visited websites.  This was a concern because I didn't want to have to start all over. Not to worry! So far....AWESOME!"
1801,"Excellent product! Perfect size, weight. Sound is amazing for its price and size. I purchased this for my 8th grader for elearning now and high school next year. Highly recommend!!"
1802,I use the laptop for school mainly and I have no complaints at all. I take really good care of the laptop and it’s still working the exact same as it did fresh out the box 5 months later.
1803,"Not worth the purchase. Chromebook just constantly restarts over and over OR the screen will go black, you only see your cursor, and then when it comes back you are back on the home screen with everything closed. Buyer beware."
1804,"I'm not completely ignorant of technology but I am definitely below basic. I usually have my husband or one of my kids set everything up for me. Not this time. I did it myself! Honestly, I cant even really boast about it because it was so easy it really doesn't qualify as any kind of accomplishment!"
1805,"I love everything about this computer. I love the apps, touch screen, and you can use it as a tablet. I am also pleased that the battery lasts a long time. The keys on the keyboard are soft and I am comfortable when I type. I am very satisfied with this product."
1806,The touch screen is great especially in tablet mode. The size is perfect for my on the go job.  The battery life is great and works all day during work and at home afterwards before needing a charge.
1807,"Broke my other chrome book tragically and kinda just picked the first up to date one I saw and I cannot say I’m disappointed. I didn’t even realize it was convertible into a tablet as it was the same exact price as my older one, very pleased with this purchase."
1808,"Mostly I love this thing. I've had it for several months now and it's got a lot of good things about it, but from time to time, the screen will just blank out when you change from laptop to tent mode (or vice versa) and I've recently started having issues with the keys on the right side of the keyboard (primarily the Backspace and Enter key) not working at all. I would recommend as a backup, but not your main computer for important tasks."
1809,It's a great little computer. Compact. Battery life is good. No complaints except I've went thru 2 chargers in a month. It seems to burn through them and i don't know why. Its not left plugged in all the time or anything.
1810,"I was skeptical of buying a chromebook, so I did some research before buying this one.  I am happy with it, and actually have a higher opinion of them now.  They are perfect for general computing needs, where you don't need a $1000+ laptop.  Long battery life, serves every purpose we need right now."
1811,It looks just like the picture on Amazon. Screen size is very nice. It does everything they advertised and was easy to set up. She is thrilled. I purchased it because it has the same feature the school chrome books have so my granddaughter can log into her school account to do certain work. She loves it. That is all I know about it.
1812,"I am very happy with this purchase.  Within 15 minutes, I was able to get up and running.  I had an Acer Chromebook so there was very little learning curve."
1813,"Speakers could be larger.  The sound is adequate but using blue tooth speakers or headphones / buds is advised .  Not for gaming the processor is not powerful enough to handle game but for photos, surfing and skype it works fine. I'm happy with mine."
1814,I've only had it for a day but I can already tell it's 100 times better than my previous laptop.  I really love that it synced with my phone and everything was able to move over and is compatible.  I also like that if there's something I can't figure out it's as as as googling it since it's Google based.
1815,"I bought this for my child for school. The set up was fast, simple & sweet. The screen is clear and bright. It’s not too small like I thought it would be. I was able to set parental controls with ease. The keyboard is just the right size for her hands and the mouse pad has is smooth no glitching or delayed clicks."
1816,"It is a great computer, i can get my school work done on it. The inky problem is somerimes it drops wifi and it doesn't give a notification when the battery is getting love"
1817,"Speaker is terrible. Bluetooth connects to my ear pods but sound wont play. Tried 2 different wireless ear pods and neither produced sound. Turned the system off/on and got one set to play, tried with the other and no sound, and then the 1st set again wouldn't work. Tried turning chromebook off/on again and still no sound, though bluetooth shows connected. Ear pods work with other devices. Too late for return. Wouldn't be such a disaster if the speaker wasn't the pits. My Galaxy Tab A tablet speaker is far superior."
1818,It’s a good laptop for simple things like videos movies social media basic games it’s basically a big phone. Not all apps are able to run though. Like Ibotta. It’s not compatible. It’s lags if you have a lot going on in the background and if you don’t shut it off when you’re done using it. I noticed that when I just close it it gets slow but good news everything saves when you shut it off. I build websites so it’s great for anyone doing that kind of work.
1819,Got this for my parents and they love it. Simple and comfortable. Touch feature and keyboard is perfect since my mom prefers to type and my dad pokes the screen. Wpukd definitely reccomend it.
1820,"This is my 2nd Chromebook and I lobe it. My 1st one still works after 5 years, but I use that one at work a lot. If you are looking for a laptop but don't need a lot of software, this is the kid for you. It boots up and shuts down quickly and is very fast all around. The camera works well too. Love it!"
1821,"I love this. I use it every day. Gets the job done for zoom meetings and streaming. Highly recommend for those who are into these types of devices, especially college students. The battery life is long and takes fast to charge."
1822,"I thought I needed a full size lap top and love, love the smaller size of the chromebook! It is sleek, easy to set up and use. A lot of power. Great purchase."
1823,"All around great laptop,  used for web surfing,  watching Netflix,  playing seek and find games like June's Journey.  Set up was easy,  sign into Google and everything like my old Chromebook.  Love touch screen for games."
1824,"Do not buy this cheep crappy computer. We purchased it thinking it would be an affordable good Chromebook, but it doesnt connect to any printers, the 10 hour batter life is a total lie, and Amazon doesn't let you return it once you've opened it and tried the computer. DO NOT BUY THIS COMPUTER!!!!!!"
1825,"Love touch screen! Great that it flips, not that i ever use it like that. Reasonably priced too! Battery doesnt seem to stay fully charged.  Use 1 day and 2 days later after nonuse, its on 25%."
1826,"Glitchy. I think I got a lemon. The cursor disappeared almost immediately and I have to power down and restart.  It happens more frequently and I have not even had it a full year.  I loved my old Chromebook but it started to fall apart after 5 years. This one, I'm not that happy with. It charges quickly, has great qualities but I'm not happy with how often I have to power it down. Wouldn't recommend for a serious user."
1827,"I am the polar opposite of a techy.  That being said, I absolutely love this versatile chromebook (my first chromebook).  It is fast, lightweight and super easy to use.  The touch screen and versatility seals the deal for me.  So happy with this purchase."
1828,Incredible functionality. Better than I expected. Was delivered same day. I have had for several weeks and I am very pleased with the purchase. I would definitely recommend to others.
1829,"Got lots of features for a great price.  I thought it had a lighted keyboard but nope - one thing that's missing.  Love the full keyboard and touch screen.  Light weight, really long battery life"
1830,I had this computer before loved it the motherboard crashed..  ordered a new one and love it just the same it isn't something u can game with ...but on thr day to day its perfect.
1831,"I get text messages for the Treasure Truck and man am I glad I swooped on this! I was in the market for something I could use for work and personal and this popped up. I'm extremely happy with the size, weight and features. I love that I can use it as a laptop or a tablet!!"
1832,"The hardware form factor for this convertible is excellent.  Unfortunately, if you are familiar with the Windows OS, you're going to HATE the Chrome operating system and quickly run into its application limitations.  This could be a good choice for students whose school has standardized Chromebooks or someone on a budget that doesn't allow for a Windows convertible like the amazing Lenovo Yoga.  This gift was sold 'As New' shortly after purchase."
1833,Concerned about it getting warm when using. If child watches utube or a movie on it the screen will start to flicker or flench randomly every so often. Not sure if its a bad egg or they all do this?
1834,"Love how light the computer is and how you can flip it around and use as a tablet. Easy to cArry around everyday. Perfect for school, fits easily in back pack."
1835,"gave to my brother as a gift and he couldn't have said more about how great it was. fast, versatile, visually very clear screen, connects well with the internet... would definitely give again as a gift if needed to."
1836,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  She really likes it, and I am happy if she is because I purchased it for her.  Amazon is good about getting packages to you in a timely manner even though I am not a Prime member.  Thanks for allowing me to order online and not have to worry about getting out amongst others especially during this Pandemic!"
1837,"I absolutely love this laptop! The touch screen is amazing, it is a very nice size. sipped super fast too. it took 4 days to get here. The batter life seems to be good. The bluetooth works great. I totally recommend it!"
1838,Why buy a chrome book when it's not even compatible with Google apps. Lol very limited on apps you can install. Screen is nice. Lightweight. Good battery life. Just limited and seems like a let down.
1839,"This computer is fine for videos and social media.  I haven't been able to print anything from the computer, though.  I contacted support and they informed me it isn't compatible with all printers but they couldn't tell me which printers are compatible.  I have three different brands of printers that are able to print through wifi or usb but it won't work with any of them.  Huge waste of money!!  I have to use my old computer any time I want to print.  Would not recommend or buy another Acer."
1840,Great Chromebook for my 13 yr old grandson. He was using a school Chromebook and can't believe how much faster and easier to get his pages up and he loves the touchscreen. Great Chromebook!
1841,"I bought two of these for my son.  Both needed to be RMAed for repairs. The first one the camera went bad.  They repaired it and then my son dropped it.  I hesitantly got him a replacement.  This one the power/usbc went bad less than a year in to owning it.  A few months later it went bad again, but then was a month after the 1 year manufacture warranty ended.  My son loved his chromebook and is so upset that it is broken again, but I am not going to pay to get it fixed. It's not worth it."
1842,Wow great price and amazing little laptop great for my needs. As long as you know what a chrome book is and does this laptop's simply amazing. Love having this one as a touch screen my old one was not and I feel it needed it.
1843,"Update: after using a few months, there is a common ‘glitch’ watching movies/shows. The Chromebook picture will start to jump/wiggle a bit and then get stuck. (Think old school like a record skipping)"
1844,"This thing rocks. I wanted my daughter to have Chromebook for remote school vs struggling along with the district provided ipad or a big computer. Great solution, I just wish I could find a nice form fitting case., There's a bunch of these random acer models, and this one unfortunately doesn't yet have a great solution. shame because it's awesome."
1845,"This device used to be OK. These days, however, the time from opening it up to being able to do anything at all is getting longer and longer. For example, the time from startup to closing a tab (ie not doing anything especially difficult) is somewhere around 2 minutes now. That is, one can do absolutely nothing for 2 minutes after start up. The screen jumps to life within seconds, but one is locked out of doing anything for those 2 minutes. No buttons, no key clicks will be accepted."
1846,"While it may not be the most flashy computer for the price and what you get put of it, it may just be the best tool I have had for my college experience and I would highly recommended!"
1847,"Very hesitant about buying a Chromebook, especially a refurbished one. But this Acer spin 311, is really cool. It can do everything and more that my windows laptop can do and it does much faster. And the refurbished one seems to me to be brand new. I couldn't be happier."
1848,"I got this because I wanted a small lightweight computer, mainly for web browsing and video streaming.  This does that well.  My only complaint is sometimes the wifi will drop out when I am connected to my phone."
1849,"This is our second acer chrome book and we are very happy.  These were purchased for our children and they are easy for them to use.  They’re tough, durable, and simple to operate.  All at a great price point.  Would highly recommend and would definitely buy again!"
1850,Got this for the wife to use.  She's not ream smart so this simple chromebook was exactly the answer.  It does what she needs without paying for features she doesn't.  She has gotten so good at it she is thinking about working in IT now.
1851,"I bought this for my kid to use in kindergarten and 1st grade. Unfortunately, it did not handle virtual schooling very well. It freezes up a lot during zoom calls, forcing a reboot. The battery does not last for a half day of zoom calls, with some breaks in between. The screen quality is meh. The storage is not good and he was barely able to fit many apps. I regret the purchase and now wish I hadn't bought it, and had just spent more on a quality Chromebook."
1852,This was my second Chromebook purchase. Very good. Lighter and more nimble than I expected; flips from laptop to tablet really easily but still feels like sturdy construction. Very happy with this machine so far.
1853,"The laptop is gorgeous and of good quality material; it's not a flimsy little thing, but a very sturdy and beefy like the more expensive ones. I haven't run it yet, so I don't know about the performance, but from the looks of things, it will probably be just fine."
1854,"I just purchased my ACER chromebook in January 2021 (today it is March 23rd 2021) and my ""Gorilla Glass"" screen is CRACKED! Mind you I've been working on this chromebook all morning and it hasnt left my side so your guess is as good as mine on how this actually happened. The product has not been hit, dropped, damaged, ect."
1855,Trying to configure an account on this by following the guides on line and many of the steps outlined by the guides are not available on this turkey.  Example:  Trying to get Chrome browser to open in the home page and it continuously opens into the Google search page.  Tried everything and just will not change.  Going back to Windows.
1856,"Love the computer so far. Screen looks great . My only issue is it has went black a couple times. I use it for work , I am a little rough at times , working mobile , rushing in and out of my vehicle . I've googled how to try and get screen back on . So far so good. It has came back on . The size is perfect for me working on the go ."
1857,"I purchased 2 of these chrome books for my children to do their online schooling. They have worked flawlessly. The touchscreen is a handy feature, and the kids love that the screen goes all the way back to use it in tablet mode."
1858,"I was worried about finding a good quality laptop online but I’m happy with the purchase I made. I needed a laptop for my schooling and this one gets the job done. It’s fast with loading what I need up, the battery life is great, the keyboard works good (im still getting use to the shortcut buttons but you can customize what you want for it in the settings), overall I love it and recommend this 2-in-1 laptop"
1859,This computer is good for checking e-mail and shopping.  The processor is not powerful enough to keep up with PCH  games.  The screen freezes up after you add the fourth window.
1860,This computer is everything that I need to get my school work and other needed task complete. It's lightweight and easy to use. Highly recommended for the touch screen capabilities.
1861,so great! Got these for my kids for distance learning and they have been really awesome. They are 4 and 5 and have been able to navigate them really well. I love the Google parental controls.
1862,"I am terribly frustrated with this Chromebook. I use Office 365 with my work (bought this for work), and I travel a lot. The size and weight were appealing to me. But this thing locks up all the time with Office products. Word, Excel, OneDrive, and the Outlook apps freeze constantly, won't finish saving, saves but suddenly it isn't available to email... it's debilitating. Any help would be appreciated."
1863,"This computer is so good, I bought 2 of them. Very responsive and works great for video calls / Zoom. If you plug into a docking station it's almost like a real computer. For the price, it's very capable and the touch screen works much better than expected."
1864,I absolutely love it! I have had it for about 2 months now and no problems. It is smaller than my other Chromebook so it is easy to carry with me. I love that it folds and turns into a tablet. The battery doesn't last as long as my other but it is still good.
1865,"So happy with my purchase. Was hesitant about it at first so I canceled my order the first go around and due to financial reasons but here I am typing on it now leaving this review and I'm happy I stuck with my gut which was saying ""get the damnnn thing"" hahaha. Love that it's touch screen, my hands just slides over the keyboard. Merry Christmas to me, Happy 2021 to all!! Cheers"
1866,I usually am not a fan of chromebooks but this is pretty freaking cool. Battery life is good. The tablet part is not so shabby either. It's a hit in this household.
1867,"For what it does it does well.  That being said there are cheaper options that compete with it performance.  But, it looks sleek, the screen is sharp, and you'll look good using it on your college campus.  It's just that I already graduated so looks (of my laptop) aren't a priority.  But, my mom would love it!"
1868,"I purchased this laptop less than three months ago. It stopped working and after 45 minutes on the phone, they'll send me a return authorization in a couple of days so I can ship it off for them to work on. My last Acer purchase ever -- and I had just bought a new desktop that hasn't come out of its box. It's on its way back too."
1869,I was skeptical at first because the nature of the product seemed to good to be true for the price however I took a risk and it payed off. When I first turned it on I did go to the play store however it kept closing it out. However I just let the laptop run for a little bit without touching it and it ran fine. LOVE IT.
1870,"ACer Chromebook stopped working after 2 months. No power and would not turn on. The only way to get it to work is to unplug the internal battery which requires taking out 12 small screws in the back, unplugging the battery and plugging it back in then reinstalling the screws. pretty hard to do in the middle of a high school class."
1871,The purpose has been achieved.  It doesn't have a touch screen and the battery life seems a bit less than my former Samsung.  All aspects are above average. A very good buy.
1872,"The first one i received wouldn't power on.  The second one works, however the built in speaker isn't very loud.  To use for any kind of application requiring sound, you need to be right next to it.  Not very useful for video or music apps."
1873,This is very nice however because I don't have internet at my home and have to go to a friend's house to use theirs at the moment I couldn't use this for working on my book I am starting. Because it doesn't come with that option to write pre installed. You have to download stuff on a app store.
1874,Completely pleased with product! Sort of a side note the price was only $5 or 10 less than Walmart. I purchased it on Prime day along with some other items that totaled ~$370 and only saved  $40 ; that's barely sales tax. I guess I need to learn a better Prime day strategy ! ;-{
1875,"It's one of the best pick I have had for this money. For a person who just wants to surf internet, watch movies and videos, it's the best product at cheap cost, light weight and easier to carry around, it's a very small screen but if you take into account the size of the phone where we spend most of the time on Instagram and YouTube I wouldn't complain about this size. The only drawback I found was that, it does not have a HDMI port, meaning you cannot connect to any kind of monitor or projecter."
1876,"I thought a normal tablet would work for what I like to do that is not using my desktop.  When I ordered this product, I was not sure if I would like it.  However, I love it!  I would buy it again in a heartbeat!"
1877,"The ACER Chromebook is everything it claimed. I have no problem with the machine itself. HOWEVER, This statement is FALSE = Chromebooks come with built-in storage for offline access to your most important files and an additional 100GB of Google Drive space to ensure that all of your files are backed up automatically."
1878,I like this computer. It is easy to use and has a great battery life. It charges quickly as well. I like how I can position the screen multiple ways and am able to turn it into a tablet. I really feel like I got a great deal for the price.
1879,Got it for a Christmas gift so it is still in the box but it looked good packaged and it even came with a case which is a good bonus.
1880,"This is a fantastic computer. My kids love it since they can flip it around and use it like a tablet. I love that it has the keyboard so I can use it for work. I also like that we each have our own log in. My files won't be messed up. It was super easy to set up. Overall, I would buy it again and may end up doing that so we don't have to share."
1881,"Never used Chromebook before but it is easy to learn even for those who are technically challenged. Love the versatility even though it's not detachable. It seems Chromebook operating system's usability is according to size, so there may be some disappointment depending on what you would like to accomplish or if you use it like an apple or Windows product. What it offers however can get the job done if you learn Chromebook."
1882,"This is an awesome laptop. My wife loves it. My kids love it (9, 6, & 4). I was unaware that ChromeOS was not compatible with iTunes. Thankfully I was still able to reboot our old laptop in order to reset my son’s iPad when he forgot his password. Probably would’ve gone with a windows-based device had I realized that. I guess I should’ve known there was a reason all the schools around here were handing out chrome books to all the kids. Outstanding laptop for the price."
1883,"This is a great laptop. The only 2 things I dislike is how the ""desktop/home screen"" isn't actually the ""home screen"". You have to go to a seperate screen to access it. The 2nd thing is that I wish there were more than just 2 USB ports."
1884,"I purchases this for almost 50%of during Prime Days and that is the ONLY reason I am not completely upset.  Zoom doesn't work because it freezes every 5 minutes.  The TouchPad won't work either.  None of the ""tricks"" are fixing the issue either.  I haven't had it long enough to not work and I have a work laptop I use 95% of the time.  Still debating whether to send it back. Don't purchase this or you may be frustrated as well."
1885,"I use a laptop for simple emails, web searches, social media, various apps, accessing pix and docs on Google drive, etc.  For those purposes this is more than adaquate and for the price - it's a great deal.  I'm very satisfied."
1886,"Like Jakey's Mom wrote in their review, we experienced the black screen of doom on two of these devices. One was used for 9 months. The other for 2 days. Will not purchase this again."
1887,"The computer looks very good the only problem that I had with it was it goes in and out of touch screen and touch pad, sometimes it will lock on on all the touchscreen and I won’t be able to access the keyboard or the mouse"
1888,"Overall, it is a very nice, well performing device for doing school work and maintaining email. The camera quality is very low. Not my first choice device when needing to meet remotely."
1889,"I can do everything i need to do linked to my home pc and phone. Can access ay file i need and with my NEW 64G flash drive, I can easily transfer files without congestion."
1890,We bought this for my daughter’s school year since they are distance learning. She loves the swivel screen and the touchscreen. Exactly what we needed. Plus it’s nice and light for her to carry around.
1891,This is my second Chromebook and it offers a lot of updates from my first machine.  What burned my biscuits was that it was already two plus years into its short life even though it was right off the shelf!  I can understand a few months but more than 2 years!  This machine should be discounted 25% to make up for the years lost.
1892,"I got this is good faith that it would work, yea did, until a month ago. I am so disgusted with it. It is hard to make things move,  The styler or my fingers won't make the screen move or go out of a page, it takes to many times to get it to accept what I want to do, now it is jammed with the Google logo on a white screen, can't get out of it no matter what I do."
1893,"Based on the spec, I don't have a high expectation of the performance given Intel Celeron N4000 CPU etc. I simply use it for lots of chrome based web office work. So the battery, screen resolution etc. is good enough. I bought it on sale which is a good deal. Otherwise, I would buy an iPad instead."
1894,"Have it delivered to my country in just a couple of days, and got one extremely happy kid learning at school! Touch screen works great, and the convertible spin is awesome!"
1895,“I wanted to use it for homework and play a lot of games and my favorite is Roblox but the processor isn’t the best so it just can’t process anything and it’s barely playable. The only games that are playable are to 2D games. But it’s fine for homework.” Written by my 10-yr-old son
1896,"When I found Chrome OS to be ill-suited to my needs, I tried to install an alternative OS or boot from a USB stick. After much research, I learned that Acer, together with Google, have prevented the mainboard from loading any OS other than ChomeOS, either from the internal SSD drive or from a USB stick. What's more, in 9 years, this device will be a brick. Even though it might be perfectly functional hardware-wise, Google will just turn it off."
1897,"The outside got scratched up super easy, touchscreen works battery runs low quickly but of course my kids are doing lots of work / schoolwork on it. They like the touch screen thou."
1898,"This laptop/tablet is a great personal tool and game device. I use it for email, word processing, and spreadsheets. The size is perfect for using in an easy chair. The touch screen is great, and very responsive. I can use the touch screen in lieu of the keyboard, if I wish. The screen is a high quality and very durable. So far the battery life is fantastic."
1899,Love this.  Use it sooo much.  I just wish it could be used as a touch screen without the keys sticking out.  I keep feeling like I am gonna hit something and break it.
1900,Bought for homeschooling and video appointments. Works great for all of it.  Easy for my 5yo to use.  Can download all the apps I need.  And it was also an amazing price.
1901,"I bought them for my children since the online class seems to continue this year at our school. Really nice, and they can play with games too. Not to mention, online school, such as Adventure academy works great!"
1902,"Late posting a review but wanted to share my experience with the product. I purchased the computer in July 2020. Two days after the warranty went out, it wouldn't turn on. I had to contact support. We finally got it working by hitting the refresh and power button. It worked correctly for a month after that. I contacted support again and they told me it probably has a dead battery. The battery didn't last a year."
1903,"Updated to 5 stars after a month of use.  Given the price point, this is an excellent laptop for the price and I've enjoyed using it.  ChromeOS has made a lot of improvements and I'm using not only chrome, but Android apps and Linux applications.  Good power, good battery, USB-C ports and power, micro-SD port, great touch screen, etc.  My only dislikes are the lack of a lighted keyboard and wasted screen real-estate of the unusually wide bevels.  That said, I'm making this laptop a hand-me-down and purchasing something with a better screen."
1904,"If they'd shipped it when they said they would, I'd've given more stars.  It's a great device.  I bought two. I even paid extra.  My kids went a week in college without receiving it, because they gave false dates/expectations in delivery."
1905,"The Acer Chromebook Spin 311 is a huge upgrade from my previous Chromebook and it suits most of my needs. I purchased it because of it's price and convertible design. The limited internal storage space and poor camera are the biggest drawbacks in my opinion. Depending on what you plan to use his for, this might be a great low cost option. There are a lot of other devices out there in this price range though. I think it's important to find out what features matter most to you before you decide."
1906,"This is supposed to be my games device, but I don't like the pad screen, it hurts my fingers due to my arthritis. I can't use a mouse on it."
1907,"So I bought this to originally hook up to my cricut. Well turns out it's not compatible with the cricut cutter. Not gonna lie, it's a disappointment but so far it seems like a good quality little chromebook. I could still use it to watch Netflix, play games, etc."
1908,I really like this laptop. We use it for online school and it’s really easy to use. My 9 year old has no issues navigating it. I like how it’s lightweight and quick to charge. Overall it’s a great laptop for light work. Wouldn’t recommend it for gaming.
1909,This is a great little Chrome book for distance learning. My son uses it for Zoom classes and that’s what we bought it for. When not on zoom he uses it to complete work. The battery could last longer but it does charge super quickly.
1910,"There is a quirk! When being used as a tablet it freezes. I have to fold it back as a laptop periodically for it to resume what I was working on. That's annoying. Other than that, I really like it."
1911,"This is my first experience with a Chromebook. I recommend taking the tutorial to get acquainted with keyboard shortcuts (for instance where's the delete key?). Using it mostly for web surfing, streaming and photo compilation. App based interface is similar to your phone, very intuitive. Fast boot-up time. Good battery life. Nice touch screen."
1912,The Acer support does not have the technical expertise to fix the problem with their own product and Google support is worthless because they say it's not their problem and they contact Acer.
1913,Product works well as expected and is pretty snappy for web surfing. The only thing I noticed was the left hinge was not installed straight but at an angle. It doesn't seem to be a problem for opening and flipping the device all the way around though.
1914,"Absolutely, this Chromebook offers plenty of bang for your buck considering certain features that it offers, such as transforming into a tablet. Now this is a device for those who want a budget friendly device and more for casual use its not going to win any awards, but it does the job a feature that people will appreciate is the use of type-c charging which can make charging a lot more easier and expandable memory. If you are in the market for an affordable Chromebook , but want decent quality give this one a go it won`t disappoint."
1915,"I found this chromebook to be lightweight and very mobile. It was also convertible, which made it more versatile. Visually, it looked elegant, and the keyboard was big and comfortable to use. The touch screen was responsive and I had no issues with it, though I prefer using a mouse so I connected one as well. I found the picture and sound quality to be as expected, and had no problems with the webcam. Overall, this was a decent chromebook."
1916,It allows me to work around the house without having to carry a bulky laptop around I can just flip it into a tablet and go but the keyboard there if I need it .
1917,Bought this for my grandson.  Chromebooks are the way to go.  Very easy to set up.  He is able to quickly access the internet for school projects and games.  Great value!
1918,"I hesitated a lot for choosing the Chromebook for my 10 years old boy that needs a computer at school, and some ratings were not good but I honestly feel that perfectly does the job for him."
1919,"Does not work. No response from shady seller after 1 week, 3 requests and multiple frustrating chats with Amazon CS. Amazon Customer Service is a joke and this seller is not reputable."
1920,"This has worked perfect for our 3rd grader doing online schooling though out the summer. It works great for google classroom, YouTube, Netflix, and general internet browsing. I really have no complaints about it, we have been using it for over a month now. It charges up with any USB-C PD charger."
1921,"We purchased this for our daughter for virtual school during COVID-19.  She already has an iPad , but were told by the school iPads were not allowed and they recommend a Chromebook.  We purchased this one based on reviews and limited supply."
1922,My first laptop or tablet I've had.  I had no knowledge of either and this was so easy to get used to.  Called the tech support number who helped me to get going and I'm off to the races.  Love this Chromebook!!  It is so nice and battery holds 10 hours.  Totally satisfied!  Putting the 2 in 1 works amazing
1923,"Wow, this laptop is incredible and the best I've ever owned. The battery life alone is stunning. I can go all day on this thing without a single charge. When it's at 5%, it still lasts a good thirty minutes. The fact that all docs get saved to google drive makes it a great backup in case anything happens, and it makes everything streamlined and decluttered. The touch screen is a bonus, as it the way it can work as a tablet. Also, this thing is *FAST*"
1924,It was good to use good quality picture was awesome it charged then a month later it won't charge anymore we couldn't charge it couldn't turn it on I couldn't do nothing with it so it sits on the side of our couch don't know what to do with it would like to get our money back for it cuz we just bought another one from you guys
1925,"Much faster and of course newer than my old Acer 15"" Chromebook, which was one of the first 15"" models they made and the only 15"" Chromebook on the market when I bought it. I got this because I wanted something good for couch surfing and my old Chromebook doesn't support Android apps so it was starting to feel very limited in use. I decided on this model after reading a lot of positive reviews, which mainly turned out to be for the last model that uses this devices same name."
1926,"Es una tremenda máquina. Corre bien los juegos, el paquete de adobe, entre otros. Considerar que su pantalla es un poco frágil se raya con facilidad. Su configuración para aumentar el espacio interno es ASOMBROSO. Precio justo para una monstruosidad."
1927,"I knew it was not touchscreen when I bought it, so I am not sure why it asked me to rate the touchscreen. Picture is great, I added more ram and brought the total up to 64 GB and have had no issues as of yet. I have been gaming for over 30 years and am not ashamed to pull this out at our conventions."
1928,"This computer arrived dead and would not charge. All connections were checked.  Tried multiple outlets. Contacted ACER to troubleshoot, we did so with no changes. Had to return the laptop. Ordered a replacement. After a week, the replacement arrived, and the same thing happened again. Do not waste your time with this product. Idk if this is a scam or what, but you will not receive what you’re hoping to. Beware. Just very disappointing for my teen. :("
1929,"I normally don't write reviews but I was so impressed I had to. First of all, came 3 days sooner than predicted which is a win of itself. The packaging was pretty well protected and came with a nice little lanyard. The display is sharp and the speed is fast. It didn't break the bank overall a great laptop"
1930,I guess this is the best value for your money when it comes down to decent laptop.  I finally upgraded from an old Dell laptop (12 years old) which at the time was top notch.  First the cons:
1931,I've been using this laptop for a little over a week now and it's been solid all across the board. Fans are pretty quiet (Similar to Asus Strix\RoG laptops) The CPU is obnoxiously powerful. I can't say anything about the RAM because I replaced mine to 32GB almost instantly.
1932,"Bueno: Buen procesador, acabado ligero, extensible, las teclas se sienten bien al tacto, la pantalla es bonita, bastante potencia y el nitro sense te deja configurar la potencia a usar."
1933,The computer came dead and unable to charge. A complete disappointment. And Amazon did NOT refund the purchase for days after I sent it back. I highly discourage  a big item purchase through Amazon.
1934,"I like the laptop for gaming, I am able to stream as well. I will say the HD and Memory size is a bit underwhelming but very easy to upgrade."
1935,The laptop came dead on arrival. No power and the  charging indicator light also would NOT turn on. The charger is working because I tested it on my other laptop. Laptop itself is dead.
1936,"I saw some of the reviews on here saying you couldn’t run certain games but I’ve had little to no issues at at. One of the things I noticed when I first launched a game was the lag on the game, but I just needed to do an update on the computer and it stopped lagging. So if you start lagging, make sure your lap top is up to date."
1937,"My son ask for this as a gift , we're in different  countries, bought  it and send to him only to know the part font fit . Don't buy 4m this site"
1938,"I'm very disappointed by acer. When I first got the laptop it was not charging. After leaving it for around 24 hours in charge, it started working. Now it's been around 7 month and the laptop is dead. Can't understand why this happened. Amazon would not help me to get it fixed. I will not buy Acer again."
1939,"I bought a model from tem years ago SAme case Chassis, It was horrible gpu burned out easily within 3 months of use, Hate to tell you nerds but ACER makes bad LAptops."
1940,"After many reviews I came to the decision to decide on this laptop but after the arrival of this unit, it won't power on and the cable used to charge won't work with the unit and therefore won't charge.  Proper evaluation of the laptop to determine if it functioned correctly would have been a good idea before shipping it."
1941,"I love using this laptop that's faster, more powerful and more smooth. It won't cause any freezed. It might be a bit hot when you're playing high quality games, it has two powerful fans that exhaust hot air to keep it runs well. It is a bit noisy, but I'm sure it's really worth it."
1942,"I am really impressed with this laptop. With the i7-11800H processor and turbo it is fast. One thing that I read in other reviews is to push the power connector until you hear it snap in place. As I was exploring and learning about the machine, I wanted to look at the BIOS. The PDf manual said to push the F2 key when the logo was displayed. Wrong! press and hold the F2 key and then push the power button. Bonus feature - pressing the F2 key at the logo does a fast boot."
1943,"I spent a while deciding on a lower end gaming machine to get after growing weary of PSN offerings over the last few years. Have been a console player on PSN for 27 years and wanted a good machine to start my PC adventures again. For PC Gaming you have to have good gear. And man can this machine deliver! It boots up and shuts down in about 5-7 seconds and flys through games and apps. I'm running Xbox live, Steam, Epic games with no issues."
1944,This lap top is junk do not buy. I’ve had this nitro 5 for 1 year and the mother board is toast. Tried to contact acer and they told me it was out of warranty. This lap top maybe had a weeks worth of use and it’s already junk. Don’t go cheap buy American
1945,"After paying a chunk of money for this laptop, you'ld think that it would be well protected for shipping with something more than one sheet of paper.  Look at the size of that shipping box!  Sure hope it works..."
1946,"*** UPDATE 8/13/2020 -- I updated drivers, and RTX 3050 is now running 58-65 FPS on Ultra, and 93-98 FPS on High settings.  I must have needed an update, this is a legitimate gaming Laptop! ***"
1947,I may be biased or underqualified.... as my laptop I am upgrading from is 8 years old and was not a gaming laptop. This thing rocks! Definitely a massive upgrade from my Dell Vostro 3558 with a Intell 5500 UHD graphics card (a pretend graphics card).
1948,"TL; DR: The Acer Nitro 5 AN515-55-53E5 Gaming Laptop is an entry-level gaming-capable computer. Its out-of-the-box specs are underwhelming, but some can be upgraded, like RAM and hard drive space. The RTX 3050 is the cheapest house in the fancy neighborhood. It’s a solid starter GPU for current games, but temper your frame rate and detail expectations. The Comet Lake i5 CPU is capable, but can run hot. Get used to the fans. Don’t pay more than MSRP, given you’ll need to fork out some extra money on ram and another SSD to meet basic storage needs."
1949,The laptop had been delivered to and when I tried to turn it on after plugging it up. It didn't show a amber light or when press the power button it was still unresponsive. Crazy thing about this product is that will have a fifty-fifty chance of being delivered dead or working. Not worth the money on playing a game of chance.
1950,"I bought two, my kids use them to play games on work well for that they can play any game out to date, the computer is capable they are good laptops do what they are supposed to do"
1951,"The lap top is working as expected, with 800 USD you were able to get a 3050 GPU, which is good for most light duty game like CS go, DOTA2, etc. Which is good enough for me. Unlike those ultra book, this one has slot RAM and can be upgrade to like 32GB and another stat HDD slot, but they don't include cable and socket. I believe you'd have to do some research how to solid one. It looks like a good deal for light gamer."
1952,"This is the best gaming laptop you can buy in its price class. It even outperforms some more expensive options. Big screen (for a laptop), strong CPU and GPU, enough memory, and a 1TB SSD. The only downside (and this is very minor): You quickly run out of battery while gaming. But that's the price you pay for a bigger than average screen, coupled with both a strong CPU and GPU."
1953,Got this machine for my kids for general use and gaming.  There were a few negative Amazon reviews which I wanted to add some perspective to - in case it helps someone.
1954,"Normalmente la batería dura unas 5 horas o menos, aunque nada mas vea vídeos, si esta encendida pero en modo de espera si dura 8 horas o mas pero la bateria se gasta también. Pero sigue siendo una buena laptop y cumple su funcion al momento de jugar con altos requisitos."
1955,"The computer is excellent. As a gaming laptop, the Acer Nitro 5 offers decent value. A really nice feature is the backlit keyboard and very comfortable to use as well. The display is decent, certainly not the best, but not terrible either."
1956,"If you're looking for a affordable gaming laptop, I'm sure this model came up. I mean, it looks cool, pricing appears reasonable, and there's room for upgrades, so what's not to like right? Well if only it was that simple."
1957,"THIS PRODUCT IS TERRIBLE 1 hour after getting it as a gift it would not charge whatsoever do not waste your money on this terrible device. (Yes, i pushed it down really hard so it would charge)"
1958,"It's RAM is kinda bluh but I'm planning on buying myself memory sticks! It's a really good laptop though and I'm enjoying being able to have a gamer laptop for the price of a normal one? It's keyboard doesn't stay lit, but I'm sure that makes it more worth it in the end. Because it prioritized your laptop's energy over all else."
1959,"Awesome laptop with an awesome price. I could not give any higher praise. And it is easily upgradeable. The RAM can be upgraded, and I bought the Crucial RAM 8GB DDR4 3200MHz CL22 here on Amazon. Easily installed to give the laptop a total of 16GB but you can upgrade it even higher. Next upgrade will be a 1TB SSD, because the only part that would take away from this amazing laptop is the low amount of storage but their are options to increase that as well. I only got the 256GB SSD."
1960,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift but it would not turn on, even after attempting to charge overnight.  I was sent a replacement, which would arrive after Christmas. I was extremely disappointed to say the least. Luckily, the replacement works."
1961,"I thought it was dead on arrival, but you have to really pay attention to how you plug it the port in the back. There is an extra pin that clicks when you push a little harder. I learned this after a mild panic attack and much research."
1962,"After much digging, I found that the processor (IIRC) supports 128GB of RAM. I'm not sure how much the MoBo supports, however, running the Crucial test, it stated that I could upgrade to 64GB of RAM, so I did."
1963,"This gaming system is a great setup when you want to be able to do both gaming and work from the same system. It's got the power to play online games with ease, but also isn't so over the top that it makes it difficult to work on, I'm able to play games in the evening like Fallout very smoothly without freezing or crashing, but also work from it during the day without having a lot of extras going on."
1964,"In terms of gaming, this laptop is on the low-end. You’ll want an RTX 3060, or preferably a 3070 for excellent visual quality especially if you plan to use your laptop hooked up to a nice monitor or TV. Personally, I use an ultra-high-end desktop with an RTX 3090 founder’s edition for high-end 4K gaming. Meanwhile this laptop is my go-to for playing my favorite MMOs, even when I’m traveling for work. The high refresh rate is exactly what I need for gaming."
1965,"So  far the product  has  worked well however the power adaptor needs to  be inserted  and  pushed all  the way in and flush with the  back of  the  laptop. The images  in the user  manual are not  accurate  and thus can make  the initial  set up  confusing .  Before you return  it please see if your ac adapter is pushed in all the way, May help!"
1966,"Everything is good whit this laptop, gmes like assassin's creed vanhalla runs at 60fps perfectly, apex legends at 110 fps, but the only thing microphone cames whit an issue, and is an internal issue is not the drivers or settings, is may something on motherboard, is no good it really sucks because you are paying more than 1K$ for this laptop, acer or amazon or the providers must be sure that Everything is in perfect conditions before sent it"
1967,So far a month in and this thing just annihilates every game I put infront of it to play. Definitely an incredible machine. Runs games fast with 0 hiccups beautiful graphics quality.
1968,"I got the version with the better processor and more ram—this thing will play modern games really well but not maxed out. The only thing that’s really bad with this laptop is the speakers are just terrible, quiet and tinny. A couple times in a brighter room I wish the screen would get a little brighter but overall great value!"
1969,"The laptop is great, I have the i5-10300H / RTX3050 version and runs pretty good. On Grand Theft Auto 5 I run with mods, (singleplayer) and get about 60-100 fps and that's with some shader mods. I also have tried destiny 2 and runs amazing no lag and runs smooth. ATS (American Truck Simulator) runs great even with Ultra graphical settings."
1970,"If the lights don't show, try pushing in adapter all the way in, I got worried until I found it, the adapter needed to go all the way in, it's a bit stiff but yeah works just fine and is amazing"
1971,"I’m so sad, I got this for Christmas and it doesn’t even turn on. I plugged it in and no lights or anything. I’m just so bummed I got this for Christmas and my heart lit up with joy only to just crumple up when the computer doesn’t even work. Don’t buy this, save yourself from the misery on Christmas morning."
1972,"Great laptop for the price. Will run any game you throw at it with no problems. Some extremely demanding games will be limited to high settings instead of ultra because of the 4gb of VRAM. However if you're gaming on the laptop screen it's very hard to perceive any difference between medium/high and ultra settings because of the pixel density of a 1080p 15.6"" display."
1973,"THIS PRODUCT IS TERRIBLE 1 hour after getting it as a gift it would not charge whatsoever do not waste your money on this terrible device. (Yes, i pushed it down really hard so it would charge)"
1974,"I'm ""late"" to the game (pun intended) with my review as there are already a few very complete and competent ones before mine.  I agree with just about everything there, so I'll just add a few of my own thoughts."
1975,"Great value for a baseline gaming laptop. Added a 1tb storage M2, and dual rank memory. FPS in Desriny2 went from 60ish to 90ish on average with less dipping. Using Nvidia optimized settings and video to only use the graphics card.I have it sitting on an angled base to raise the screen and for better airflow. Running the cooling in auto. BIOS does not support XMP, and I not sure it is using the dual rank config but it runs as expected. the picture of the box is how it arrived, no padding…really…."
1976,So the product came not charged I thought it was broken so I ordered a new one the new one didn’t work either it was because I didn’t plug it in the right way it’s like very confusing to plug it in and kinda complicated cuz you have to turn push turn then push the plug in the computer for it to charge
1977,"This laptop is great for gaming if you can upgrade the ram to 16 instead of the factory installed one. It will run great for your standard blizzard rpg games, league of legends and riot based games, and almost all non-cpu intensive games like gta5."
1978,This is a great computer for its value. It gets the job done with the majority of games i play. I just wish that it was shipped it better condition. Computer works great nothing wrong thankfully
1979,"Everything it was said to be.  Battery life is a little on the short side even when you're not really doing anything.  But other then that, can't recommend it enough."
1980,"So, at first I thought it was dead on arrival.. I tried different outlets and all.. I was even requesting to a refund.. but I know this sounds like a simple fix.. step 1. Relax, Step 2. Put back the power cable and use a bit more force till you hear a click.. trust me.. I thought I was using enough force at first.. it should show the indicator light.. then switch it on.. good luck 🤞🏾"
1981,"Just opened it and got it setup, but so far I like it. Acer is a good company, especially for the price. I cannot wait to start gaming on here!!"
1982,This thing is awesome. The only thing I can say that isn't great is the speaker quality. The speakers suck. But that's a easy fix. So I still gave it 5 stars because I truly love this computer.
1983,Very fast for the money. Upgraded the NVME drive to 2TB and memory to 32GB 9TEAMGROUP T-Force Zeus DDR4 SODIMM 32GB 3200MHz (PC4-25600) 260 Pin CL22 Laptop Memory Module Ram - TTZD432G3200HC22-S0100. Works perfect! Battery life pretty decent at 4-5 hours medium use. Wifi is fast and Screen looks great for everyday surfing and movies.
1984,Like the keypad lighting up in sometimes dark areas of work. Light and easy to carry in one hand while open. Powerful enough for what I use it for which is mainly HVAC controls and literature
1985,"I was skeptical on getting the laptop when I saw some negative reviews about it being DOA and not charging. Fortunately, after reading other reviews, I decided to bite. This laptop is definitely worth the money. I use it for school and for gaming. It's the best of both worlds. It runs smoother than my desktop and it plays games beautifully. I have no issues transferring my external hard drive between my laptop and desktop for my steam games which is awesome as well."
1986,Fantastic motion flow during live FPS heavy operation. I was most blown away by the insane Wi-Fi abilities though! The killer Wi-Fi feature is so proficient that it’s consistently getting stronger upload/download speeds than my new M1 Pro chip & Asus zen book.
1987,"I love this laptop, it is able to play almost every modern game at fps over 40 and most stay above 60 if their settings are set for boosting fps."
1988,Me encanta no pensé que sería tan hermosa y cómo mueve los juegos y para los que no les carga empujen hasta escuchar un click la Pc trae un seguro
1989,"Acer Nitro 5 AN515-57-79TD Gaming Laptop | Intel Core i7-11800H | NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Ti Laptop GPU | 15.6"" FHD 144Hz IPS Display | 8GB DDR4 | 512GB NVMe SSD | Killer Wi-Fi 6 | Backlit Keyboard"
1990,When I plugged it in there was no life no lights whatsoever. Was very disappointed but when I called customer service they said to make sure the charger that is on the laptop end make sure it clicks in properly. And that was it! It started up right away. I thought it was not working my son was very upset. But it was pretty simple issue. So if you have this problem just make sure you hear a click sound when you plug the laptop in charge
1991,"The cpu is 2.5ghz, but it has 4.5ghz turbo. So I am happy. It shows 4.2+ghz on task manager and I tested doom and got steady 120+hz. I upgraded with another 8gb ram and 1tb ssd for only about another $100 so for around $900 I am very happy with this purchase!"
1992,"also the 3050ti died, within a couple days.  also the cpu and gpu (when it was working) was getting super hot due to all the bloatware, these slim laptops weren't meant for power house hardware packed into tiny compartments."
1993,"My eldest child had tech requirements for his laptop when entering his freshman year of quality. This particular Acer checked and exceeded every requirement AND I was able to make payments. Not only has it served its purpose academically, but my son has enjoyed the graphics and speed for gaming as well."
1994,Acer has built a really nice entry-level gaming laptop here that's quite capable (scoring over 4900 points in Time Spy)  and relatively nice looking - it has some gamer aesthetic touches like the red vents on the back and the red keyboard lighting but nothing too showy.
1995,"My Alien finally died on me and I was at a loss.  After a decent amount of grieving time, I decided it was time to start looking for a new PC.  I am pretty picky about my computers since I do a lot of gaming.  I after reading the reviews on this one, and decided it sounded pretty decent despite a couple of negative reviews about the keyboard."
1996,"I purchased this for school work, & to use with my Oculus Quest 2 to play Steam VR & Oculus Rift games. Works like a charm. Great package for the money."
1997,Very happy with the laptop.  Will upgrade the memory but was still a good deal. I am a little apprehensive about the hinges as the look awful flimsy and each hinge is only about 2 inches each.  We will see if it holds up to a preteen gamer…
1998,"On August 30, I bought ten of these laptops for my students. One of the students had a bad charger. I contacted Acer support on September 15. It's been nearly a month. No contact from Acer support. I'm on support chat with them now and they said, ""I see no records of sending the charger because when you contacted us the first time, the device was out of warranty."" Evidently, Acer only offers a 15-day support window. I'm switching to DELL."
1999,"It’s a really good laptop. It can run so many games! I play Valorant, Minecraft, OW and more and I haven’t came across any issues while gaming. I also use it for school when I’m not playing anything. I suggest having it plugged in while using it/playing, other than that, everything is gooood, I’m really happy with it! :D"
2000,I wanted a gaming laptop but didn't need anything super high-end. I am getting into graphic design and wanted something that would last me a while and have enough under the hood to do what I need. I haven't started with graphic design as of yet (my next moderate purchase is a good graphics tablet) but I have been using it for gaming and literally everything else it is superb.
2001,"I got my computer on February 1st. It had a defective screen. I sent it to Acer. It took them two days to get my a shipping label. It took seven days for it to reach them. After they had it for a week, they could not give me an ETA on when repairs would be finished. I finally got it back today, on the 25th, and immediately returned it to Amazon because I had to have a functional computer and couldn't hold onto my loaner without a solid estimate for when I'd get this one back."
2002,"My wife and I like to do some casual gaming now and then, and the most intensive games that we've played in the past year are Divinity Original Sin 2, 7 Days to Die, and L4D2.  We general don't need the fastest computers to get decent framerates at 1080p."
2003,Donot waste your money.  It arrived dead and would not turn on.  I bought it for my son’s birthday.  Not only it arroved broken but also was late on delivery!
2004,"It is very fast, the screen quality is great as well and I definitely would recommend you purchase this. You can upgrade as well because it came with the attachments for upgrading the RAM"
2005,"This is amazing quality for the price. I am able to play any game I want at the highest speeds and metrics. I haven't used the touch screen, but anticipate it would work just as well as everything else. Very glad I went with this computer."
2006,"If you're looking for something that can play most modern AAA titles at medium or low, this is IT. Slap another 8gb of ram and some storage in this thing (under $140) and its an amazing budget laptop for the price! It also includes a free month of game pass and an upgrade to win 11. It's awesome. I love it!"
2007,"I needed to replace my previous laptop after 5+ years, but I didn't want to break the bank. After researching different gaming laptops, the Acer Nitro 5 stood out as the best balance between price and performance."
2008,I will say it could be because I use it for CPU intensive activities like music production and gaming but the battery life seems to be pretty short. Other than this I’m completely happy with this purchase.
2009,"I am Game Artist. I use 3D modeling and game engine programs like Unity, 3DsMax, Blender, Photoshop, and Unreal. I also play plenty of MMORGs and Steam games in my (very little) free-time. And I really needed a new work/personal gaming laptop as my last Acer Predator was starting to degrade after several years of constant use. So I decided to try the Nitro since I really liked the Predator and have an Acer monitor as well."
2010,"This laptop was a wonderful upgrade that I don’t regret one bit! Before this, I was using something way weaker that couldn’t get the job done at all but this laptop is good for games and more!"
2011,I really like how easy this laptop is to upgrade. Immediately upon receiving it I added 2 16gb RAM bringing it up to a total of 32RAM. You can add a total of 32 to this one. I plan to also add a PCI-e ssd to it since it’s so easy and has an extra slot. Maybe later on I’ll add the 2.5 ssd!
2012,"In the ""almost touching four figures"" range, there are a lot of surprisingly good gaming laptops coming onto the market from different manufacturers. Assuming each one was available, you'd be spoiled for choice this summer. Decent processors, nice midrange RTX GPU's, and at least a certain degree of expandability should be expected."
2013,The Nitro series from Acer is their budget line of gaming laptops. Tucked away in this line are some hidden gems and very capable laptops able to handle your gaming needs. Is the Acer Nitro 5 up to task? Hopefully this full review will answer all your questions.
2014,"Came on time, upgraded the ram to 32gigs, added a 2tb hdd and a 1tb ssd and it runs nice It you buy it you gotta upgrade the ram and storage and it’s pretty good for the price."
2015,"My son sent me the page for this, knowing what my desired specs and budget were.  Then I read the reviews and was almost scared away.  He talked me into at least trying it and I am so so glad I did!!"
2016,"I've only had this for a day now, so I can't speak to longevity. All in all I'm pleased with this laptop. It's lightweight but packs a punch still. Set up and updating was quick and easy. It's a great utilization of space, only a slim border around the screen and keyboard."
2017,"So far this laptop seems decent. Manage you’re expectations. You can’t buy a mid-range gaming laptop and expect all the best. I’ve yet to try some of the more demanding games. But for the games I play these days, like Fortnite, Apex, Rust, R6 Siege, Subnautica, and No Man’s Sky, it’s performing pretty well."
2018,Haven't really tested it yet so can't testify to the specs but if you think it's dead on arrival the charger is difficult to plug in. Myself and three others tried to turn the laptop on and couldn't get it to work. I finally pushed the charger in as hard as I could and it clicked in. Started right up. Much more difficult than my other laptops. Thought this info might help someone else :)
2019,"So I seen a lot of people complaining about dead on arrival units, the battery ships completely dead. I was confused why it wasn't turning on or charging, a quick search on YouTube. The simple solution is to plug in the charger more til you hear a click. Then you're good to go!! Amazing laptop!"
2020,"After trouble shooting multiple reasons as to why my first order of this laptop would not charge or turn on, I returned the item, waited a week for the refund, then re-ordered for my son-only to have the SAME issue. Do NOT purchase this Acer laptop. It’s a waste of money and will not charge or turn on. Now I get to repeat the process again. Huge disappointment."
2021,Bloatware on this device.  Was not interested in Norton and when tried to remove could not due to application error.  This is a problem with the Image Acer uses to load these in the factory.
2022,"If negative stars were available, this would rate a minus 5. Like many other buyers, this item was a brick: Dead on Arrival. After 3 hours of dealing with ACER Customer service and Amazon's incredibly insane return policy on a high value item, I was finally able to arrange a ""normal"" return."
2023,"The laptop has been performing perfectly so far. The case does seem a little bit on the plastic side. However, if you take even reasonable care I don't see that being an issue."
2024,"It’s a good laptop overall but there seems to be problems with it every now and then, for example the laptop freezes up every now and then but not so often"
2025,My PC died on my and I decided to splurge and pick up a high end one. I’m glad I picked this one.  None of my games have had any problems.
2026,"So on Christmas morning I thought it was DOA. However, you really have to push in the power cord into the back of it computer. There is a noticeable click. If you do not hear the click then it will not charge."
2027,For the price I think it’s a solid deal honestly Added a second ram stick an a 1tb sad and it is solid great for a first time of player
2028,"Everything was working perfectly until I started gaming on it. Was playing Apex when it started to blue screen of death on me. All drivers, and updates were installed. Apex was being played on low to medium settings and the laptop would still crash to blue screen. I do not recommend a 3050Ti 4GB. The other components seem to be good but maybe this was a lemon."
2029,"I had to return the Acer Nitro to Amazon.  The computer failed to boot properly twice within the first two weeks and both times it said the system needed to be completely reset before using it again.  I have had an Acer Aspire for more than 5 years and it has performed without a problem during that time, so I do not have the patience to keep wiping and resetting a brand new $800 dollar computer."
2030,Laptop comes in the mail. Second day gets error and blue screen. Third day sparks and kills itself. Manages to turn on. The plug in port would beep nonstop and might shut off again as if the battery is nonexistent.
2031,"It just started blinking orange and dindt turn on, when connected it won't charge, hopefully i can have a refund of this if not well whatever im sending it to someone to fix it and lose money....good luck"
2032,"Frames will be locked at 60 automatically, you have to change the settings yourself. The laptop can barely run a small game without issues, I’m kind of disappointed. I use this “gaming laptop” for everything besides gaming now."
2033,Good laptop for playing games at medium settings at a steady 60fps on certain games. 8gb of ram is not enough though. recommend upgrading to 16gb of ram if you plan on playing games. Otherwise no issues when using it for the first time and runs great!
2034,"I really liked the look of this computer and gaming was great for a laptop, but there was something wrong with it. As soon as I got it and updated everything, the keyboard started freezing and the only way to type was to turn it off and on with a mouse I had plugged in. At random times if I clicked on a drop down menu to type it would start typing random things or just entering spaces for no reason. Maybe a lemon? Idk."
2035,"The power supply has to be plugged in VERY firmly to the back of the laptop... It didn't look like it could go farther in, and the laptop wasn't charging. I pressed again really firmly and heard a click, then it finally started to charge."
2036,"Tiene un rendimiento excelente para su precio. Refrigera muy bien lo cual es estupendo ya que vivo en un área calurosa, los videojuegos corren perfectos a más de 170fps con máxima calidad y eso que aún no le hago overclock al chip de video ni al procesador. Lo único que no me gustó es que la bios viene muy, muy restringida."
2037,"Had all the features I wanted (3 x USB & ethernet), decent sound and SSD.  My first Gaming computer, have to get used to the keyboard layout, since it's slightly different from a normal keyboard (some keys smaller than normal)."
2038,Got this because my old laptop was dying and I am happy I did.  It far exceeded my expectations and I am enjoying playing Lost Ark and WoW on this at max settings.
2039,excelente producto. el  equipo responde de forma excelente a programas de diseño. corre con rapidez los juegos actuales. la entrega fue mas rapido de lo esperado. muy contento con la compra. agradezco al vendedor.
2040,Need to push power cord until click heard! I thought I got a dead laptop until I read a review in Spanish that pointed out that the power cord that plugs in to the back of the laptop needs to go in until an audible click is heard.
2041,Works good bought this for my son but still lags on gaming but not just in online gaming but offline games too i realize lagging online is latency due to wifi signal & usage but that's not the case as i mentioned told my son to test but he never mentioned anything till now so I'm having issues with expensive returns after return window closes & my trust with Amazon is decreasing my husband will have to contact support if anything is wrong cuz they have given me a headache recently.
2042,"Got ir under $800 and its a very good laptop. Playing games like witcher 3 flawlessly. The cooling is nice in this laptop, and mi cpu doesn't get pass 55° in cold rooms while playing witcher which is the game im currently playing."
2043,"I play rdr2, Fortnite, csgo, halo infinite, etc. just fine at regular settings, haven’t tried to push it too much settings wise but I’m fine with the regular settings on the games and they run good, no lag. The fan can be loud but I wear headphones and after a little bit you barely notice it."
2044,"Great laptop for the price and easily upgradable. Bought to play elden ring and some other games with friends instead of console, and elden ring runs great and smooth. Does get a little warm if airflow isn’t clear but that’s to be expected from a gaming laptop."
2045,"Always been a fan of Acer and needed something to run some hames on Steam. This runs BeamNG , Teardown, ARBS , pretty well at normal to high graphics. I did have (ok want) to upgrade the SSD and RAM so that typically would add cost. It goes up to 32GB RAM but 16 has been fine. 15.6” screen is great especially in 144hz. Cooling fans all over it to keep it cool."
2046,"So I loved this laptop for a whole day. Thought it was great. But suddenly after just 24 hours, it’s broken. It says that my battery is at 100% yet if I unplug it, it automatically shuts off - just goes straight to black. If I wanted a device I had to keep plugged in to use, I’d have bought a desktop instead."
2047,"Great product but buy the ram and hard drive upgrades, they're easy to install. I use this with my Oculus Quest 2. Some troubleshooting with Windows 11, but runs great."
2048,"This is a great entry gaming laptop for my 12 year old who will be 13 next month. The colors and graphics are great, he loves the lighted keyboard, and this definitely has a bit of weight which contributes to the sturdiness."
2049,"This would've been a great buy if it wasn't for the faulty charging cables. I seen others complaining about it and figured maybe they got a bad shipment. However,  I have the same problem. I have to keep replugging it in to get it to work."
2050,"It’s honestly not as bad as people say, it handled downloading games in a 90 degree environment without problems as well as a decent performance right out of the box (clocked The Forest at 150fps) fan is a bit noticeable but can be quiet when doing low performance tasks. Weight feels good and the screen is amazing for movies/games"
2051,My son got this laptop for Christmas and he loves it.  Great beginner gaming laptop!  It was super easy to setup!  Literally set everything up in less than 30 minutes.  Worth every penny so fart!!
2052,quiero agradecerte hoy recibimos nuestra nueva laptor ...super rápido y muy oportuna ...todo venia muy bien empacado y el producto en optimas condiciones ....que gusto hacer negocios con alguien tan serio y cumplido  mil gracias
2053,I received the laptop and couldn’t figure out why it wasn’t charging.  Read a lot of reviews to see what the problem was and after 20 minutes I just pushed the charger into port harder until it clicked a second time.
2054,"I took the i7 with RTx 3050 version, 1TB. I already have MacBook Pro, but I bought this because I just need it for gaming (no HW, projects, or anything) JUST for gaming! I played cities skyline and Counter Strike, and I didn’t face any problem. I really recommend to buy the same version that I have if u want a laptop that can handle strong games (COD, FAR CRY etc). And talking about the RGB keyboard (the version that I have cannot change the color, even if you go to NitroSense App - ONLY RED)"
2055,It runs great able to run some big games at a good fps but storage and ram is a bit on the low side other than that if it new to PC and don't know what to get this is ur best choice.
2056,Runs everything at 144+ Fps on external screen. (I'm talking GTA on high settings) I've been in the pro scene of gaming on Xbox and this delivers for comp gameplay. Siege 200+ Fps. Fortnite 300+Fps. GTA 144+ Fps. Warzone 100+ Fps. Valorant 400+Fps. Runs VR great aswell. This is a great pickup for gaming but the storage drive is a little lacking at 256 gigs.
2057,"This is a great Laptop as long as it's plugged in. Battery life is supposedly 8 hours, i can barely get this running for 45 minutes without it needing to be charged. Disappointing."
2058,La pantalla no es tan buena porque cuando juegas se ve como una clase de línea rara pero corre muy bien los Juegos solo necesita que le metas más ram y listo
2059,"I got my daughter this computer for Christmas and she has absolutely loved it.... until one of the keys broke off. Most of the time she uses an extra keyboard for gaming, she was using the laptop keyboard and the s key broke off!! I can't put it back on very upset about this"
2060,The battery life is a joke and the audio system is weak.  The screen is nice and it can handle high-quality graphics/visuals easily. But it's not worth it for a battery that doesn't even last 3 hrs in battery saver mode.
2061,"I made sure it had backlight keyboard. Yes, it has one, but shuts off every 30 seconds and NO WAY to keep it on or change that length of time. Stupid feature, so you are always having to hit any key to turn it back on. The most annoying feature ever.at. Worse yet, the keyboard is hard to see in even low light when it isn't lit up. The backlight keyboard, while true, is misleading. Would never have bought this computer if I had known that."
2062,I gave the screen a 4 because I have to figure out how to activate that. I haven't gamed in over 10 years on a laptop and I gotta say I love it. I'm kind of new to gaming and this is prefect for me. However if your having trouble charging angle the charger to point to the right and make sure its pushed all the way in. It gets hot but I bought a cooling fan for this when i made the order so I most def recommended.
2063,"Battery life is horrible wouldn’t last 2 hours when I first got it I keep it on charge now, Laptop is extremely fast and has ran everything I’ve thrown at it so far, and the black gets extremely dirty really fast"
2064,"The quality and feel of this laptop is definitely top notch, also the performance for gaming which is what it was intended for is great. Unfortunately the battery life is just horrible.  I bought it as a Christmas present and I've been told that it has to stay charged to the wall when in use because how has it depletes battery."
2065,"Been using this mainly for music production and gotta say very happy with it given what I paid. I use Ableton Live 11 Suite with many plugins like Serum, Omnisphere, Kontakt, etc and performs well. I will occasionally game on it and it looks and runs nice. Been playing Retail WoW and Genshin Impact the most and both run smooth. Can't beat that 144hz!"
2066,"If you're trying to play minecraft or other small games this is perfect, but AAA titles like Warzone and demanding games alike this isn't your best bet. For reference in warzone with the lowest possible settings you get 50fps on a good day."
2067,Excelente producto para el precio lo único que deberían mejorar un poco es la parte de la refrigeración en el sentido que los espacios por donde circula el aire de afuera hacia adentro deberían ser más grandes
2068,The screen flickers like an old tube TV attempting to get a station. Attempted to deal with Amazons customer service to trouble shoot and was passed to Acer. Worked with them for 3 weeks and even shipped it to Texas with a VIDEO of the issue. Got a letter back to say they couldn't replicate the issue but replaced the screen. Turned it on myself and within 30 seconds of it idling it was back at it. The customer service was absolutely horrid. Never again. Wasted time and energy on a plastic piece of garbage.
2069,"The charging indicator didn't light up when plugged in and the device would not turn on. Just put it in the return post. Will update my review when I get my refund. Because of the price, Amazon won't just send a replacement, I have to wait a week after they get it back to get my money back and then make a new purchase. Because I'm not the first to have this exact issue, I'm contemplating looking to buy a different laptop altogether."
2070,Product arrived dead on arrival. Plugged in (firmly after reading other reviews) to charge for the first time and light would not come on to show that it was charging. Attempted to power on laptop and would not turn on either. Offered a refund but price has gone up and would have to pay more. Will not be ordering another after further reading reviews.
2071,"This game plays all the steam games I own. Most at max graphics settings. I can even run Cyberpunk 2077 at above the settings that Nvidia GeForce Experience recommends. The SSD is large enough to store over 25 relatively recent games. If you're a retro gamer, I've gotten  MegaRace 1 to run on this guy."
2072,I bought the Acer Nitro 5 with the i5 10300H CPU and the RTX 3050. I upgraded to 16 GB of RAM and added a 1 TB internal SSD and the review is based on the computer after the upgrades.
2073,"I am not at all disappointed with this laptop! Screen is beautiful. It is super fast! It does need an upgrade in memory(8GB for $40) and HDD(1TB for $80), but it appears to be pretty easy to access and upgrade. They even give you the cable for the HDD upgrade. Will be testing out a few games, in the next couple days. Did not purchase for high end gaming, so I think I will be pleased, based on how quickly this thing moves for everyday activities!"
2074,Computer was completely dead. Would not start up even when attached to power. Trying to get it returned has been a nightmare. The only way Amazon allows you to return the product is to wait for UPS to come and pick it up. Since I have to go to work everyday and I am not about to leave it outside so it can be stolen I am forced to take time off from work in order to get this defective product returned. Lesson learned about buying computers through Amazon
2075,"I've needed a laptop for travel for a long time, and overall it's great. Ive been able to keep up with family and gsming friens much better while traveling. Only drawback so far is that pre-installed Windows 11 is driving me nuts, the layout is annoying and it is being much more intrusive with service solicitations than any previous OS ever was."
2076,I have a flight sim and a pc projector which is ceiling mounted like 40' away and has a looooong hdmi cable. After installing windows 11  started having problems booting windows. It's noise on the ports. Unpluged the flight stick and long hdmi cable and it boots fine. It was fine with windows 10 also. It's some setting up the ports with windows 11 and is most aggrevating. The answere is to leave the joy stick and hdmi unpluged unless it's on and using it....
2077,"I bought the i7 version of this laptop expecting it to perform, well, not as good as other laptops, due to the lower price. However, I was absolutely blown away by how fast it is, running games or even just using it for work. The image quality is fantastic, you can also easily connect your gamepad and play whatever you want at max. I didn't pay attention to the speaker sound though, since I always use a headset. I loved this laptop! It's really an excellent choice."
2078,"If you’re low on money but want a gaming laptop that runs good but, not only gaming, it’s also good at editing. Might want to upgrade RAM and SSD storage to make it run at peak performance but other than that it’s a free low budget laptop."
2079,"Got this bad boy for school and casual gaming, screen works just fine and everything boots up just nice. I haven't gone too heavy into triple A titles yet but so far the performance is pretty good and doesn't get loud or hot. Will update in a few weeks or months. In terms of budget, can't be beat for the class of hardware it's got."
2080,"Product lasted less than 1 year. I called Acer support service, three times already and a host of worthless  people with fake names were unable to solve the situation or give me instructions to send the laptop for repair or replacement. I guess they are waiting for the expiration date…So disappointed! We are never buying this brand again."
2081,"Brand new laptop doesn't power on doesn't charge. Used multiple different outfits and chargers and still doesn’t turn on. I open up the laptop to try and fix the issue there is rust on the screws. It’s so bad four screws won’t even come undone they literally chipped away and broke my screwdriver. Do not buy, this is a scam"
2082,"I was pleasingly amazed at the quality for price ratio. I added another main drive, and swapped out the ram. I use it exclusively for off-line gaming. I play modern games on the best settings. No problems. I also keep it on the best 5 fan cooling pad I could find. Excellent device."
2083,"que bruto pongale 0... recibi la laptop hace un par de dias y me asuste mucho, porque no encendia, ni cargaba ni encendia ninguna luz.. la deje toda la noche conectada pensando que podia haber venido descargada de bateria, pero nada.. al dia siguiente ya estaba a punto de contactar a soporte para enviarla a garantia, y me puse a leer el manual. cuya instruccion decia, al conectar el cargador asegurese de empujarlo hasta escuchar un click...ahi estaba el fallo.  despues de conectarlo correctamente, encendio de una y hasta ahora vade maravillas.."
2084,"I'm primarily impressed with the speed though I may be biased since I had an outdated computer. The color, the graphics, everything is excellent and I'm just getting started with learning everything on this system."
2085,I can't complain much the quality for the price isn't bad if I had to nitpick I would have 1 issue I live in the us but I got a Eu charger so spent some extra money on that other than that it's a pretty good gaming pc
2086,It did not work on arrival had to clean power terminal. Than 3 months in stopped working completely had to send it back for fix. When it worked a nice laptop. For price though not a great machine should work out of box and for years not a few months.
2087,"Envio rapido a Peru, muy buena laptop por el precio pagado, hasta el momento ningun problema funciona perfectamente ,  tambien funciona perfectamente linux junto con windows recomendable laptop la core i7."
2088,Screen quality is good speed is good gaming is great however it does get hot and heats up and if you have to unplug it at a meeting the battery dies in 2 hours so the battery sucks
2089,Bought it couple of days back and the laptop did not boot at all. I almost returned my laptop when I read a comment suggesting to push the pin all the way in at the backside of laptop until an audible click is heard. It worked and rest of the experience was smooth.
2090,"Nice reasonably priced gaming laptop. Day after I bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter, I found one at a local discount freight store for 400, just lucky I guess. If I wouldn’t have found the cheaper one I would’ve been happy with this one. So as far as quality;; this laptop is great !! And even without the freight discount markdowns I would have been ok with it because it’s still a good and economical choice"
2091,"The USB - C hub is not connected to the video card so you cannot drive a VR headset from this port. The online information leads you to believe that this will work, ACER says it does not."
2092,"I'm not a gamer, I'm an amateur photographer who uses photo editing software.  I had seen advice that recommended using a ""gamer"" pc to run photo editing software.  This laptop rocks, it makes adjustments to photos in seconds as opposed to minutes on an older pc.  I've never had the pc fan come on because of heating, it is very silent.  Highly recommend."
2093,Really good laptop for the price. Runs games at ultra graphics like a gem. The only reason I give it four stars is because they sent me a broken charger and I had to buy a new one. But they did refund me for the charger at least. Also the battery does die pretty quickly. Other than that it’s a great purchase!
2094,"Got this a week ago and can I say, I didn't expect the RTX 3050 in here to be this good (It has a low TDP). I suggest getting more storage and ram. It will vastly improve your experience with the machine"
2095,"I wanted to experience a true fast  gaming PC, but entry level.  This Acer has exceeded my expectations in every facet.  The picture is immaculate, the processor is super fast I have yet to see any slow down.  If there is anything at all to improve on it is the battery life but what do you expect with a fully lit gaming PC. The memory is limited but it works for the way I use it.  I would buy again"
2096,"I really shopped around for a laptop I could use for video editing and graphic design. The Acer Nitro 5 AN517-54-79L1 had decent reviews and it seemed like the best option in my price range. Well, the first one I ordered had problems so I had to send it back, then the replacement Amazon sent had the exact same problems so I had to send that back too!"
2097,"Okay so the title of this review maybe misleading, but I noticed this is one of the biggest issue with this machine, it even got me the first time. Had to order a replacement. When that came in same issue no power."
2098,I don’t know what could be possibly wrong with it or if I’m not doing something right . I just opened up this new laptop out of the box and it won’t turn on nor will it charge . Can anyone help me please ?
2099,"Great computer for gaming and business. Lightweight and easy to upgrade. A stick of ram and extra storage and can handle any game with ease. Works great for the oculus  quest 2, just need the cable . And you have a whole new library of games and free content not offered in the oculus store. Would highly recommend this laptop."
2100,I’ve had 2-3 of these with varying gpu over the years and have always been satisfied. This one blue screened within 2-3 months after gifting it to a graduate heading to college. Win some lose some
2101,It's a decent gaming laptop if you are playing games that are not taxing. Even for a laptop with a 3050 installed and the fans cranked to max this laptop will feel like it's gonna explode. I had two moments where it would shut off from overheating while I am in a game of league of legends on medium settings. So I had to switch to low settings to even play league without any frame lost.
2102,"I bought this PC to game when going on various work trips. The 3060 performs really well. It’s great for entertainment. Only drawback is the size, but not difficult to carry with the right kind of backpack."
2103,"Venia todo perfecto en un embalaje que era imposible que viniera algun desperfecto, el portátil cumple con las expectativas con sobresaliente, muy bueno, la unica pega es que hay una pequeña mancha en la pantalla casi indetectable que hace que en ese punto se vea mas clara, quizas ya la pantalla venía así por que no creo que fuera por el empaque, debe ser cosa del proceso de fabricación justo en la que me enviaron por el resto perfecto."
2104,My computer wouldn’t play WoW and I was disappointing a friend because I kept getting disconnected all the time! This think runs it like a dream! I highly recommend! 😍😍😍
2105,"When I received my Acer laptop it had what looked like a small ding in the top left corner of the screen-- to my disappointment, this meant there were very large, awful crack streaks & lines going down the side of the panel, rendering this laptop useless. Currently awaiting a refund. When I got it in the mail, the factory seal on the box was already broken, meaning this laptop may have been a refurb or previous return. I'm sure this laptop may otherwise be a great model. Buyers take caution."
2106,"Arrived in perfect condition. For medium gaming only.  The RTX 3050 and I5 doesn't keep up with newer titles like the new Hitman series.  256 Gb storage is useless if you want to game.  These days, it should be a crime to ship anything under a TB of storage.  Wish I had paid the extra $300 for the 1TB and RTX 3060."
2107,I love the simplicity of it but I hate the storage capacity. You can upgrade the storage and buy a new ram to get more fps in games. The battery life isnt that great.
2108,Shopped around for months extremely pleased with this laptop. I play WOW and skyrim mostly and have had no issues. Only thing cant quite figure out is why it says my graphics card is out of date under WOW log in. IDK. Seems to run great to me. Thank you.
2109,"I bought this for my wife. Once I got the laptop I ordered a 500gb hard drive and 8gb of memory to add to the laptop. Acer included the hard drive cable to install a second hard drive, a very nice touch since the laptop only came with a 250gb drive. Installing them myself saved me some money. She loves the performance of this machine, the 144 hz display and is extremely happy with it."
2110,"It is amazing. I played a lot of games in it but the only problem is the rtx 3050 gets so hot and quickly hits 100% usage. Perhaps an extra fan under the laptop will do fine. Beside it getting hot it will work just fine. It makes no problems in games. No black screens no crashes. Windows 11 is an extra plus, and 1 months of game pass is a little favor if you ask me."
2111,I5 10300 H is a great CPU but it runs really hot normally around 95C which worries me because that’s the melting point I would recommend putting on a new layer of thermal paste to help you keep it optimal but it is a good gaming laptop I use it to play VR chat oblivion Destiny 2 and a few other games like the Sims but it it runs well and it also runs well playing fallout new Vegas
2112,Todo bien el equipo de 10....Recomendaria que lo protejan mas con un poco de Poliexpand... decepcionante el servicio e UPS en Peru pero al final llego...no tuve que pagar demas en el envio..
2113,"If you are looking to use a laptop for playing any type of game this will do it for you, as long as you have it plugged in. When on battery I can still play some less intense games. I use it to edit videos and use it for work doing inventory control so I can say I need it but when the boss isn’t looking im on steam."
2114,I run x accounts same mmo and all 3 work without a hiccup on high graphics. but i play on low with high draws just to keep it lasting and to get more fps control etc...
2115,"At this price, you'll have a hard time finding the same raw power anywhere else. So far, I've played No Man's Sky and Planetside 2 (at default settings) with no framerate issues that I can notice. Minecraft with RTX also works. It has a few framerate hiccups, but I've seen the same from some desktop RTX cards."
2116,this laptop is very fast it has a 10th generation i-5 and nvidia 3050 graphics card it can be used as a gaming laptop it just need to be upgraded in the ram department which I did I added 16gb of ram and I also put in an additional 1tb of ssd drive. it is lightweight and seems to be able to handle anything you throw at it!
2117,"I bought this laptop after seeing several negative feedback from people who received the laptop dead because it would not turn on, the same thing happened to me, I connected it and nothing happened, however it is not a defect of the laptop, you have to connect the cable strongly until click and it will turn on, I was about to return it and ask for a refund, but everything is fine."
2118,"I bought this 2/2022,  six months later and those bright white lines are appearing. I contacted Acer because, warranty. I’m dismayed that this is apparently a known “extra” included with their products. I’m an more dismayed that they expect me to pay for shipping this to Texas for repair. Why? Because this defect has been shipping from the manufacturer for years. Do Not Recommend. I’ll stick with Apple products as I have done for the past 23 years with zero issues."
2119,"I purchased this for my daughter and her SIMS game.  I am highly satisfied with the way this laptop runs this program and would recommend this for anyone that is just starting out with gaming devices due to the fair price and performance, at least with this particular PC game."
2120,Don't waste your money buying this laptop. Bought this computer for my son's birthday a couple months ago. The screen started glitching and turn black. The lcd cable needs to be changed.  Waste of money.
2121,"I was looking for a good gaming laptop since I have no enough time or room for a desktop PC and after searching I found this laptop. I am not planning to use it for very powerful games since I already have an XBOX Series S, but it works better than expected. Fast, comfortable to use and it does the job."
2122,I needed a new laptop with the basics but my 14-year-old son wanted something to play games on. this had great reviews as a great value for the money for gaming. It was very easy to set up and Has good screen quality. He was gaming within an hour of turning it on. So far so good!
2123,You must firmly press the adapter to the back. It looks like it's plugged in but it probably isn't. Keep pushing against the back of the laptop until you feel a click. Failure to do so will result in the laptop not powering on.
2124,"Highly recommended! Great quality, came fast and well packaged.  Got it for my daughter to start streaming and for games as I do myself. It's a great alternative to a desk top gaming pc. I love it and got it all set up, accounts and all, for her. Most importantly she loves it!"
2125,Bought this for my wife to do audio video processing and some light gaming. I upgraded it out of the box to 16gb of ram and added a 1tb nvme m.2 drive. It works perfect and can handle any video editing and even very modern game titles with ease. With right at $1000 invested it was a good deal.
2126,I’m not a gamer but bought this for its fast speed to keep up with my fiber optic internet. Love it and have no complaints. The lighted keyboard is a plus!
2127,"anyone has the laptop does not power on just push it firmly and u will have it working, u can change the charger it may help then ask for a refund."
2128,This machine is quite fast for a gaming laptop with a great refresh rate that makes games and action films look spectacular. Overall good price for a great gaming laptop.
2129,"Was recommended this gaming laptop months ago, so when it went on sale it was a must purchase for me. So far it’s met every expectation, has run every game in my Steam collection without a problem."
2130,"Bought to replace an aging Acer Nitro, this thing rocks, added a second M.2 drive, the 144hz monitor really makes things smooth.  Paid $1029 with Windows 11, 17.3"" screen (Black Friday).  I have been pleasantly surprised with the 3050ti.. this is a great gaming laptop, will play any game, most on medium/high graphics settings.. as of this review, one of the best bang for buck deals on Amazon..."
2131,"Desde un comienzo debo quejarme de la batería, ya que desde el principio no duraba más de 3 horas sin el cargador. No vino con el cargador original y supuestamente tenía los sellos de seguridad intactos. Ahora en cuanto a rendimiento, sí es buena. Solo es cuestión de aumentar la memoria ram y otro par de TB al almacenamiento interno y listo. No vale lo que cuesta. Si pudiera cambiar de computadora, lo haría."
2132,"Tiene un estilo muy llamativo estilo carro deportivo, excelente ventilación, cuenta con muy buena velocidad por su procesador y la ssd, en juegos se apaña muy bien si se le ajustan los gráficos ya que no es una súper gráfica pero da buen rendimiento"
2133,This laptop is really good I thought it was broken at first but I had to push the charger in all the way and hear a click but this is a good gaming laoptop
2134,Was good but stopped charging after first month. Bought extended warranty but Amazon making me deal with acer directly. Complained about that so Amazon is allowing me to return. The new one has been great
2135,Just like many I had issues with the charging cord….but I kept reading reviews and found someone who said to push until it snaps into the laptop….and it worked! I’ve never had a laptop that plugged in that hard but it is perfect for my gaming son! He loves it.
2136,"After a few hours of fiddling with it, this laptop ran a very heavy VR game, IL2, almost as well as my top end gaming desktop with no hardware mods.  Great VR machine at dirt cheap price!"
2137,Got this as a christmas gift for my kid and its a good thing I checked it first. I plug it in and notice the charging light doesn’t activate. I try to power it up and it wont turn on. Hoping this gets resolved soon but even if I get a replacement it wont get here in time for the holiday. This review is going to be a 1 star pending a working replacement being sent.
2138,they wanted to be able to play modded minecraft and call of duty but their old one just didnt run them well they absolutely love this one as it meets all their needs
2139,My husband and I got this for his big Christmas present. He loves it and has been on it since before Christmas everyday I asked him how does he like it and he says it runs great for the games he plays. Not sure what games but they cost money lol
2140,I have had the computer for a little over 2 months. I'm a mom so I don't get to use it as often as I would like. However it runs my games smoothly even with mods added. Loads content incredibly fast compared to my 4 year old computer. I believe we'll be purchasing another one shortly for my husband as his computer is nearing the end of its life. I would recommend this computer for sure.
2141,Only hit against this is it doesn't support 3 monitors. If anyone knows a solution to this please let me know. I brought this laptop specifically to review Amazon purchases and my work laptop is infinitely better. But still does it's job and is worth the money.
2142,This laptop did not work out of the box. It had a loose cable on the motherboard that was preventing it from  booting. The webcam has one of the noisiest images I have ever seen.
2143,Le agregué 8GB RAM y 1 TB M.2 y estoy totalmente satisfecho ya que la RTX 3050 no hace cuello de botella con esa configuración. Recomiendo esta LAPTOP pero si agrega más RAM.
2144,"We are using this Acer Nitro 5 laptop for streaming church services.  We run the external camera into OBS, where we transcode 1080p to 720p, and live stream to YouTube or Facebook, while simultaneously feeding the OBS virtual camera to Zoom, and recording the service locally in Zoom on the laptop.  There is no noticeable fan noise. The laptop doesn't even break a sweat!"
2145,Works great even better than expected however the stoa rage isn’t amazing that is expected with what I ordered and it’s amazingly customizable for storage and ect. The computer does get really hot sometimes when playing but the fans help cool it down well. Amazing computer highly recommended!
2146,"Not as good as I had hoped, not that great for music production. I upgraded it with 64gb memory and faster hard drive and still struggles at times when recording. kind of disappointed."
2147,"The laptop itself is sturdy but the screen has an odd yellow tint to it that makes everything look a little off, also the audio without headphones is kinda bad mostly since it sounds like the speakers are on the bottom of the laptop but it works well enough, a little pricey for what you get though."
2148,"Their are definitely better gaming laptops out there but this one is just okay. I’m kinda stressed out. This is my 2nd time buying a nitro 5 and they just seem like they are prone to breaking. First one just shut off and never turned on after having it for a couple months, my second one the ram, cpu and screen started acting up pretty much just messing up the whole laptop, only with in a couple months again. I enjoyed gaming in it but for the price you can definitely get something better or build something better."
2149,"The case is great, super slim and modern. The keyboard is only red, no customization. Keep having an issue with the audio driver. Will randomly stop all audio output and will tell me no audio device installed. Good for games like minecraft and roblox, but seemed to get choppy with Stormworks."
2150,"Got it 2 days ago and Im in love. Everything works smoothly, added extra SDD and ram and it can run pretty much any game. Its great for work aswell. Overall great laptop for it's price."
2151,This laptop does the job when it comes to gaming. Playing the latest games I pull 75 fps. The only thing that is crappy is the hard drive space. I went out and got a 2tb external hard drive to put my games on. But other than that it does the job.
2152,The audio from this computer is barely loud enough to hear and that's at its loudest setting.  Otherwise very fast and quiet. Screen quality is good. I don't much care for the keyboard - seems mushy and imprecise.
2153,"Just to cut to it, this specific model of the Nitro 5 is incredibly a solid all-around; from the lots of room to expand storage/RAM, great keyboard, good cooling, etc.. The performance is great as well as it can play most modern games at 1080 ultra settings at great FPS."
2154,"I liked the price of this gaming laptop. However, sound quality is an issue as is the graphics card. I bought it to be able to play MMORPG and got constant messages to upgrade graphics card. Will be buying seperate computer speakers as the current ones I can hardly hear even at the highest volume setting."
2155,"Got this laptop as a gift and its perfect for any gamer. I am not a big gamer but the display when playing League of Legends is amazing. To experience the full capability of the laptop, its best to use when plugged in to the power. A full battery gives about 4 hours if its used for minimal tasks. Overall, its a great gaming laptop, graphics are awesome, I like the keyboard travel. It actually light as compared to other laptops. Would definitely recommend."
2156,"The lit keyboard is worth mentioning; it will stay lit for up to 30 seconds then goes dark.  Can't set it to stay on. This is not a laptop to play on in the dark. The MSI Stealth laptops with the rainbow keyboards are far better, all other things being equal."
2157,"Hasta el momento todo bien, super eficiente. Estoy probandola aún... Descargue Witcher III y se ve increible. también descargue varios programas de trabajo como Lightroom y Photoshop, y todo bien hasta ahora. Vino todo super bien! lo unico que quizas sea muy poca memoria, pero ella tiene sus slots para integrar nuevas memorias hdd y ssd. En la pagina de Acer te dicen como hacer eso de colocar un nuevo disco. Gracias! Satisfecha de esta compra."
2158,"My son could not wait for this computer. He uses it every day and loves it,  Says it is the best and so happy. His friend recommended this to him who know everything about computers- probably can build his own. My son loves  all things technical so I trust him and says - get it ! Never once complained about it!  He would say something the first day- not a peep !"
2159,"I love the UHD larger 17"" screen! I bought this for business, so I knew I  would need a gaming computer because it can handle large file sizes, high-resolution vids that I want to do for business. The large memory for viewing and building complex sites can slow down a computer, but with the high memory and storage and the operating system on an SSD drive, nothing slows down this beast.  My son just bought an ACER; there seems to be a lot of value for the money compared to other brands."
2160,Pues esta bastante bien para el precio que esta es bastante rapida con la memoria SDD y ademas luego de actualizarla se ve todo bastante fluido ahora solo quiero agregarle otros 16 gb  de ram mas para tener  32 de ram .
2161,"Second Acer I have owned.  The last was good, but had heat problems, and they seem to have addressed this on their newer models.  Run's great, fast retreaval, great for gaming so far.  I also run a second Acer monitor on it for productivity when working.  Works like a charm."
2162,"This computer can handle everything you throw at it, I got the RTX 3050 version for 800+, but I highly recommend that you upgrade the devices RAM, to get the best out of the Graphics Card. I will be doing that very soon, myself. You can also upgrade the SSD with two of them including a hard drive as well, I highly recommend you guys buy this computer it is totally worth it, if you are interested in serious gaming."
2163,"I would recommend this labtop for gamers. It has a concurrent FPS of 65 and it has 3-4 hours of gaming life. The backlit keyboard is a constant red color (the color can't be changed. It's always red.) This labtop is very quick at searching things up, and I'd recommend it for anyone who just needs a good labtop that works nicely."
2164,"Had the opportunity to grab this Nitro 5 10300H/3050 for $699. The 4GB vram on the RTX3050 is a bummer but it’s a brand new Ampere GPU with plenty of power for max 1080p gaming. The 10th gen i5 CPU is a small beast. A 1080p/144hz screen with nice brightness. With some little tweaks you can undervolt the CPU and overclock the GPU, upgrade the RAM to 16GB at least and you can squeeze a lot of more performance from this budget gaming laptop. Very happy with this purchase."
2165,The brightness is low compared to the other laptops but I think that’s only because of all the good specs the battery can only takes so much but really good for gaming
2166,"I would say that there are a lot of problems that I am not sure whether to attribute to the laptop itself or to windows 11 being terrible. Basic functionality like, ""If you close your lid, you'll need to restart your computer every time you open it again or it won't play videos,"" or ""The search button doesn't work at all,"" or ""Plug and play usb functionality stops working and you need to unplug and replug things constantly."""
2167,"I have had this laptop just shy of 2 weeks and have issues already.  I bought it for a specific game, discord. and Google Chrome.  That's it.  My screen turns black and freezes, or replicates and vibrates the images on it."
2168,"The laptop was designed so that the keyboard could not be replaced. Was shocked to find this out as that is a common thing to replace with a laptop. So FYI - if you break it, you're looking at buying a new laptop."
2169,"I won't comment on this laptop's performance, but the keyboard's faint red letters drove me crazy and you can't program brighter or different color  letters to aid visibility. I returned the unit promptly in August 2022. Have still not been reimbursed. Now I have no laptop, and I'm still out $$$. Not good."
2170,Added a 1 TB SSD and upgraded to 32GB RAM for just under $200. Took a laptop that was listed at 650 and now it has specs that match the $1199 model. Plays all the newest AAA games at very high or ultra settings with 50+fps. Overall I can't think of a better deal on a 30 series gpu laptop available right now.
2171,The unit I got took turning on and off.  The fan was so loud that it’s not worth it.  I went out and bought a MacBook instead.  At least MacBook doesn’t make any noise and it’s just as fast
2172,"This is great for light gaming but don't expect high fps.  I saw someone complaining about it not having enough storage.  This laptop comes with a extra m.2 slot and a 2.5"" SSD slot.  It's easy to upgrade storage and ram"
2173,"Had purchased this same PC with Windows 11. It was a train wreck from the first power up. Almost everything I did (attempt to install any game, load any game, uninstall, etc) resulted in at best the game crashing to desktop or at worst BSOD. This happened constantly, the computer became unusable. Promptly returned and ordered the same laptop except with Windows 10. It is WORLDS better. For me, W11 was a total disaster; most modern games just don't play nice with it."
2174,"Laptop doesn’t hold more than 2 MMO games. Decent graphics and nice looking laptop for price. The reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 5 is it doesn’t hold many DL games AND we bought 2 of these and one of them got a white screen of death after 4 days, had to plug it into our PC monitor just to see anything and to be able to clear everything off it to send it back and request a new one. So that really sucked."
2175,"This is a great computer. I'm not necessarily a huge gamer but do partake at times but my kids are always playing something, setting up Steam was quick and it had no problems whatsoever running multiple advanced games with great graphics. It was easy to setup initially and lightning fast, well worth the $$$ I paid and I have no doubt this will give me many years of service like my last Acer laptop (still going strong nearly 10 years later)."
2176,"Best PC I’ve ever owned, runs everything perfectly, but don’t plan on using it for long if you’re not around an outlet. Out of the box, it took about 1 hour of WoW to go from 100% to dead. This is a great bang for your buck and I love how it’s been preforming for me, but it’s basically gotta live it’s whole life connected to the wall."
2177,I had this laptop for 3 months then it died on me I can’t reinstall windows I took it to geek squad and they said there’s no way to fix it.
2178,"Am writing this review from the actual laptop. So far, it's going well .... When this laptop arrived, it came with a protective box over the actual laptop box, that protective box was flawless BUT the laptop box was opened. The seal was propped up and the sack the laptop came in was upside down. I bought this laptop new. A sticker on the laptop has a little minor peal on it. I was hoping to keep it on for aesthetic reasons, but I might peal it off in the near future now."
2179,Sleek little laptop. Issues. The integrated graphics is the default so you must mess with power settings and  drivers and the Nvidia control panel 3d settings to actually get the graphics card to work with games. Plenty of resources online. Must get drivers from Acer support not nvidia
2180,Laptop did not turn on or recognize power source when plugged in. Looks like a nice expensive paperweight.  The laptop was received in a large cardboard Box commaxe come up about twice the size of the product Box. Possibly damaged during delivery because there was plenty of space to bounce around. After looking at reviews it seems that this power issue is a common issue for this laptop.
2181,I bought a brand new laptop with a faulty ac adapter. Amazon customer service was useless so was acer tech support so now i have to send this thing back.
2182,"Received a dead laptop (wouldn't turn on even with charger), asked for a replacement and received another dead laptop, opted for the full refund instead a replacement... will not buy an Acer laptop ever again. Had to go down to the local computer store (shout out to MicroCenter) and got one that actually works."
2183,"After opening the box, it did not turn on. I thought the battery was low, so I connected it to the charger, but the led did not turn on. After a whole night connected, it did not turn on."
2184,That labtop worked great. But Windows11 and the Microphone have become a nightmare. Honestly regret buying this because of windows 11. installing and uninstalling drivers to try and make something happen. Bluetooth and Standard Microphone port are shot.
2185,"Went to plug it in & set it up on arrival & immediately it would not turn on. Battery light wouldn’t come on when it was plugged in so I called Acer tech support & now have to send the laptop in to get repaired. Took an hour to take out of the box, figure out it was busted, & repackage everything. Now I have to wait for a shipping label, drop it off and wait 7-10 business days for a new laptop to be fixed. Not great quality control."
2186,"Would be possible to have so bad luck in life, I have ordered the computer so excited about it and then when it arrives the computer doesn't work, it didn't turn on and charged.  The real thing is that I've never expected that it could happen. Why does the company make sure of the correct functioning of their devices?"
2187,"The laptop is great except the item description is wrong. It incorrectly states that the USB-C port can be used as a display port. It cannot be. The item model AN517-54-79L1 does not have a USB-C port with display capabilities. If you are interested in having a laptop with two separate monitors, this is not the laptop for you. ACER does have laptops where the description is true, but this is not one of them. I am returning because of this."
2188,"Booted exactly long enough to register it. Never even had the power light come on again. It wasn't the power cord that was my first thought, I already had an I5 version of the Acer Nitro 5 and that one would boot with either cord but this bargain delight wouldn't even light up with either one. Unhappy to the point of disgust, had plans to install an 8 terabyte 2.5 drive as well as my Samsung 970 Pro 2 terabyte in the two open slots. Would be hard-pressed to be less satisfied with a purchase."
2189,"I'm sure it's a fine computer, but beware if you have to return it.  The vendor will charge you a 15% restocking fee even if it's returned before 30 days.  They will also keep an additional $17 of your funds with no explanation."
2190,"I order laptop from my daughters account, after plugin no lights no charging, I run small computer repair business, I know little bit about computers, I used my testing power supply and other option to reset machine from keyboard but nothing works, no replacement options from Amazon other than return so I did return, I am not able to reorder the product due to 01 per customer."
2191,"The thunderbolt port on this does not support displays, there is no way for me to extend the range of monitors outside of the single HDMI output. It should be clarified in their description."
2192,Would not turn on. I plugged in and no charging lights either. Tried multiple plugs on house and push power button many times as well my daughter was so disappointed was her Christmas gift.
2193,"I've just received this one. But the charging indicator didn't light up even I plugged in. Also, the laptop would not turn on. Very disappointed.. I will reorder one more time and see what happened to the next one."
2194,"I thought wow what a steal for the price, a 1TB SSD, a 17 inch screen? Received the Laptop in 2 days, unboxed it and admired the look, plugged it in and nothing. Plugged it in again and….. nothing. Called Amazon and was told I would need to call the manufacturer. I had to state to the person that I was not going to do that and that I wanted to return it. The representative then said I would receive a gift card and again I had to say no and that I wanted a full refund."
2195,This laptop says it's for gaming but you can't even run dual monitors. It has one. ONE! HDMI out port and the USB-C port isn't lighting so you can't run a monitor on it. Even after buying a USB 3.0 doc for it with an additional HDMI port on it you still can't run a second monitor.
2196,"WOW Never expected this from Amazon in a brand new item unbeliable it didnt even blink the screen,  I read the menus thinking that it was me the problem, but not this computer did anything. I need this to be fix, I read the comments from other customers and it has happed before, need a refund or and funtional item I can use."
2197,"Bought 2 units, first did not work out of the box, Charging  / AC light was not lit, was unable to get power to the unit. Unit 2 worked for 3 hours, however when we tried to reconnect to the power cable to charge the laptop there was no power indicator."
2198,"For this exact computer I'd pay very nearly double in my country, so the value is very good, obviously it's not the beefiest computer out there, but I don't really need it to be."
2199,"Ever since my son got this for his birthday, he has yet to emerge from his room.  I walked into his room the other day, not knowing he was there, opened the shades and got hissed at by what I can only assume was my son.  I did not recognize him through all the soda cans and candy wrappers."
2200,"The description for this laptop is incorrect. In the list of available ports it is state that there is one ""USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C (DisplayPort)"" which would mean that the USB-C port supports video out through an adapter or hub, but that is not the case. The USB-C on this laptop is only a standard USB 3.2 Gen 2 port that DOES NOT support the displayport alt function."
2201,"I am a 66yr old man with Red/Green colour blindness. The keyboard was so hard to read (even on full brightness) that I sent it back on that alone. If you are a young dude or someone with good eyesight it won't be a problem to you. I also learned that some Nitro's have a menu where you can change the keyboard colour, not my one. I learnt: 'Turn the lights off and see what colour the keys are, if White you have RGB if Red, they stay Red."
2202,"The laptop wouldn’t power on.  Another detail of warning, all the emails indicated that a signature would be required  for delivery, but it was just left on the floor in the common area of the apartment building, indicating that I was shipped without the signature request."
2203,"I just opened the box and wanted to set it up but guess what! Doesn't turn on, doesn't charge, doesn't do anything. I tried numerous outlets thinking that was the problem but nope. Just a very expensive brick. Terrible quality control."
2204,"Muy buena pc, se puede actualizar fácilmente para más potencia. No se calienta demasiado, las bocinas están bien (aunque uso audífonos casi siempre) y fácilmente puede reemplazar una pc de escritorio por su precio."
2205,"I was so disappointed, lab top would not power on.  Tried several know good plugs, charging light would not come on. This is a total waste of time. Do not waste your money. Do not fall for the reviews or the hype. Not worth it."
2206,My first ACER lasted a little over a year before it died.  I saved up and purchased this ACER and it is pretty much DOA.  The manufacturer wanted me to ship for up to 10 business days. Don't have time for that so returned through Amazon.  Done with this brand.
2207,"Please don't be like me, looking at all the bad reviews and thinking that is a problem with that specific laptop or a problem on their end. It's not. It stutters about every 15 seconds going from around 250 frames in a game to 7. This doesn't just freeze your game it also stutters your audio as well. Im going to resend this and replace it if that one has the same problem I will update with this review to state so if it is fixed I will also update this review."
2208,"Just purchased this for my daughter. She's been waiting a week. Unfortunately, it doesn't work right out of the box. The unit won't receive power at all. It's been on charge for over an hour. The battery indictor light doesn't come on. My oldest has a similar laptop so I swapped the chargers and they both work fine. Laptop was a total dud. Complete waste. I'll be updating this if they make it a pain to return. Taking my money elsewhere."
2209,"Espectacular maquina, muy facil el aumentar la ram y añadir el disco duro, viene con un M.2, por lo que solo queda una ranura M.2 y la de disco duro libre, extremadamente facil de instalar ambas opciones, los juegos corren genial, la gran mayoria van de los 70 hacia arriba, unico problemilla que es obvio, la letra Ñ es complicada de encontrar jajaj, pero todo lo demas, increible."
2210,I ordered this as a birthday gift  and was pleased that it arrived in a timely  manner. Unfortunately my happiness soon turned to disappointment after noticing the void tape had been cut. After plugging it in and giving it fifteen hours of charge time then attempting to turn it on nothing no power it was defective someone  had clearly tampered with it.
2211,"I saved up for this laptop for a long time, and I received it broken, it will not charge no matter what I try. I've read other comments like this and I'm extremely disappointed in the similar reviews. I've returned it and I'm waiting for a refund."
2212,"I ordered this gaming laptop so that my son (9) and I could play online games together. This was a Christmas gift. It DOES NOT WORK. It will not turn on, charged or uncharged, while plugged into any of three different outlets, all of which work for other devices. Basically, I was sent a $1000 non-functional device. This is unacceptable at best and my son is DEVASTATED. I cannot begin to express how upset I am with this."
2213,"Entrega muy rápida con los cuidados necesarios para la compra. Llegó en perfecto estado y el equipo a pesar de ser en su estructura de plástico pero elegante, lo mejor es la pantalla y su interior porque el desempeño en juegos una maravilla!!!."
2214,"I anticipate your questions - was the AC adapter plugged in correctly, was the outlet working? I checked both several times, all fine, just no response from the battery charge light, no lights whatsoever, no charge, no start."
2215,Bought this piece of crap on april 20th and it wouldn't turn on. Sent it back on the 25th and 25 business days later still haven't received my laptop back.
2216,"The unit arrived dead.  Plugged in the AC adapter firmly, checked cords, (we had a second AC adapter of the same specs).  Power lights never lit up and the unit would not turn on."
2217,"We received this laptop yesterday. Plugged it in for almost 8 hours to charge. No lights came on showing it was charging. Pushed the power button. Nothing. No pull tabs, or on off switch. This is a $700+ paperweight.  Now just waiting for UPS to pick it up so we can get a refund. I do not recommend buying this."
2218,I have very light computer use. Most people I know told me not to bother buying a gaming computer because I don't play a lot.  Still this computer is toast not even 8 months after purchase. Save your money.
2219,"My daughter order this gaming laptop on Thanks giving, I was happy but my happiness goes in drain, after plugin no lights laptop never work DOA (dead on arrival). I have told I cant reorder it because deal is 01 per customer nor I will get replacement, no other options except return."
2220,"This laptop initially worked well, but after a week the video began crashing. Even during the BIOS splash I'd see video glitches and artifacts; something in the hardware was clearly broken. I returned this unit and did not order another.  I guess I'm lucky because it failed early, and failed in such a way that I didn't have to bother troubling shooting OS and driver issues."
2221,"I'm an architecture student and I bought this laptop as I needed an affordable but powerful laptop to run some of the architectural software (Revit, Inventor, etc) while on the go. The dedicated 3050 comes in handy when rendering finished models and the CPU is beefy enough to handle all the processing requirements these programs take."
2222,"Bought this computer and was sent one that was dead on arrival. Filed a complaint and requested a new one, same thing dead on arrival. Terrible quality control, would love to write an actual review for the product but it's been over a month and I still have yet to get sent a laptop that turns on."
2223,I love everything about this computer except the backlit keyboard does not stay lit very long at all and I have not found a way to change how long it stays on. I don't know why it can't just stay on all the time.
2224,"Imagine my 10-year old son’s disappointment when he saved up $1200 to buy a gaming laptop and it finally arrived- excitement high- only to find the piece of $hiY didn’t even turn on. Very very disappointing and just sad for my son. Thanks, Acer. Buy elsewhere if you’re a consumer reading this."
2225,"Seemed like a solid laptop, but had to return because any zooming on the track pad caused like an open windows waterfall effect, duping each window a dozen times. Tried to get product support, no luck. wanted to exchange because I got it on an amazing sale, no luck."
2226,Only bought this for the portability that supposedly comes with owning a laptop. However the battery life is awful and it consistently drops connection on Wi-Fi every 10-15 minutes. If I wanted to be plugged into a router and a wall I would just use a desktop.
2227,Just received this and I’ve followed the steps of start up and either the cord or the power bar is faulty or the laptop is but I have not been able to even turn the thing on!!
2228,"It came with a completely dead battery, return is currently pending. I was really excited for my laptop upgrade. I probably could have swapped the battery myself but I didn't want to void warranty and discover any other issues so I sent it in."
2229,DoA ! 1 Star for now . Purchased as a Christmas gift for my child and when she opened it and we got it plugged in . It will not power on or charge . It shows no indication of charging (the light is on not when plugged in. Tried troubleshooting but none of the suggested methods I found work .  I Would not recommend this product
2230,"I did not like anything about it since what happened. But I'm not going to lie, my son did like it cause of course he was playing games on it. What kid wouldn't like that."
2231,"I received the laptop, plugged in the power supply, but nothing would light up or power on. After troubleshooting with Acer tech support, they wanted me to send the laptop in for repair. I decided that a brand new laptop shouldn't need repaired and opted to  return for a full refund instead."
2232,"I got this because Acer told me this was compatible with Oculus 2.  When I received it, it was not compatible. When I contacted Acer support.  Support told me I needed to purchase a model with 32MB memory.  Sales tells you one thing, support tells you another.  I got the better model at $1400.  That one did not work either."
2233,I bought this item last september. It was not working upon arrival. I then contacted amazon customer service and they sent me a few suggestions which did not work. I was then sent some contact information for acer warranty service and i have been unable to get into contact with them. Now for the past 6 months I have been stuck with a laptop that is broken.
2234,Several keys on the keyboard have fallen off and even after trying to reconnect them they come loose.  Got tired of them not staying put and started using a wireless keyboard.
2235,"Screen flickers when playing mildly graphics-intensive games. These games (Total War Warhammer II and others) worked just fine on my 2016 laptop and the screen did not flicker. The screen then continues to flicker in other screens outside of the game. It is nauseating, and would be dangerous for people who are susceptible to seizures. The fans are very loud as well."
2236,Immediately spent 4 hours trying to figure out why this laptop would NOT recognize the Nvidia 3050ti installed in it. Called Acer tech support which was completely clueless. At that point packed that expensive piece of crap up and sent it back. Will not buy another Acer product.
2237,Bought two of these one right after the other because the first one would not come on. Same thing with the second one. Beginning to believe these are pirated versions
2238,"I got the laptop, plugged it and allowed it to charge for 20 minutes or more, pressed power button and it was dead. No lights or anything coming from it, I read reviews and majority of the negative ones were for the same issue, a dead computer. I still gave it a chance and I also received a dead computer. Went to best buy in person and got me a different one and was able to use it the same day."
2239,The battery life on this thing is terrible you always have to plug it even when you shut the laptop off and not alot of games will work on this laptop best to get a desktop this laptop need charging even when shutdown
2240,"Do not waste your money. I mean IF you can get the computer to stay on or hold a charge, it is beautiful, and great for gaming. But right now it has the purpose of being nothing more than a $900 paper weight for me."
2241,"Purchased mid 2021, computer worked amazing well for 8ish months  but now all the sudden the computer can't utilize the GPU (3050) and the motherboard will not launch BIOS... if anyone has any idea what is causing this it would he greatly appreciated."
2242,"Plugged in power supply to a known functioning AC outlet.  No indicator lights on the laptop.  Nothing happened when the power button was pushed.  Can't recommend based upon this one experience.  Hopefully, we can get another one that actually works."
2243,"Main issue is screen display all the way turned down while playing a card game, I’m lucky if the battery even lasts two hours! Disappointed about battery life mainly! Sucks having it plugged in all the time!"
2244,I was given a defective laptop. Wouldn’t even cut on. I wanted to get a replacement but they wouldn’t let me. So I decided to do a return and by an HP instead. Need better quality control.
2245,"I have always wanted this laptop but unfortunately it didn’t turn on once I plug in the charger. I thought maybe I let it charge for a while, so I let it charge overnight. Turns out it still didn’t turn on so I returned it the next day."
2246,I definitely recommend if you are looking for something portable and small. The screen was smaller than I thought but if that’s not a dealbreaker to you I highly recommend!!!
2247,This laptop arrived dead. Multiple reviews have stated their laptop arrived dead as well. Don’t waste your time with this. I tried charging through 3 different outlets and still nothing. Returning and refunding. Tech support was very helpful in making my return and refund. Again- do not waste your time with this Acer Nitro 5 laptop. It should be taken off the Amazon site as a whole.
2248,So the product wouldn’t even turn on. Definitely read other people’s reviews as it is in fact just showing up broken and unable to work. Got it fresh out of the package tried to plug it in and it just didn’t work. Wouldn’t even light up.
2249,I purchased this as a gift for my nephew and we did not open it until Christmas. The screen ended up being cracked and there customer care was well below satisfactory. They would not even work with me on an exchange or refund of any kind even after I sent pictures. I now have a 900 dollar laptop that does not work and a child without his Christmas present. Would never purchase from this company again. I recommend you Work on your customer satisfaction and service.
2250,"As many others have stated, this product arrived dead. I will not deal with Acer and risk more terrible quality control. You can see it’s plugged into to laptop and wall and doesn’t receive power. Who’s to say if it’s the cord, or the laptop itself. It’s a problem that’s been reported enough to not still be sold to consumers."
2251,"Ordered 2 of these for my boys for Christmas just to open them up and find that both were dead and no matter what I did, they would not charge. Save your money."
2252,"Did not manage to use it really. Mainly have it stored on the shelf and use about 10 times. Last week start to look for ssd to increase storage, and screen died, completely. Honestly it's very disappointing. So far it's my worst purchase."
2253,"Everything was ready to roll out of the box, very easy setup and zero issues; minimal packaging and fluff.  The kid was playing Minecraft with RTX shaders on it within 30 minutes of unboxing."
2254,"It's fast, amazing screen quality, just great for AutoCAD, which is what we wanted it for. For gaming, it's superb. One downside....the volume is loooooowww, very very low, an external speaker is a must."
2255,"Just like the sticker states ""VOID."" Thats exactly what I did, and I'm returning it. The low rating is because I was expecting a brand new item, and I received this. Total waste of time seriously what are the workers thinking when shipping out open items ! So frustrating!!!"
2256,"Will not turn on, dude from acer said I need to send it in for repairs... I told him to pound sand and I'm not repairing a ""new product"" I'm getting my money back and going with a different company"
2257,"The computer wouldn't charge straight out of the box. I plugged it into every available outlet, all of which work. I made sure every connection point was snug, and that the charger was fully into the laptop, and still no charge."
2258,I expect a laptop at this price would be ready to use when I received it. But no it's the begining of a nightmare. First I got a laptop with a broken keyboard. After some trouble shooting I have no choice but to ship it back.
2259,"Had this laptop for less then 6 months trated it with the upmost care, used essentially as a desktop. It was only moved 3 times from its initial setup, and now it is a brick. It will not charge and will not turn on regardless of being plugged in."
2260,Jack of all trades laptop that does everything pretty well. Ill go over some of the important categories in detail. I did end up returning this laptop for reasons Ill mention but it is a good device overall.
2261,"I bought this laptop with the intention of using it for school and for some light gaming. I wanted something thin, small, light, with good battery life.  I didn't expect to pay such a low price for an item matching my requirements. This is a great laptop but it's got things that one should know about before buying."
2262,I was searching for a new laptop for weeks. When I saw the acer swift x and all the details I understood it is gonna be my laptop right a way.
2263,"I got this laptop for Christmas as a gift from my parents since I will be going off to college soon for engineering. I needed a mid-range laptop that had good battery life, solid and light build quality since I will be on the go, a strong CPU and GPU since I will be doing CAD and maybe even some light gaming, and of course a good price. This is a tall order for any laptop but I am impressed with this thin and light."
2264,"This Acer Swift X has the specs -- AMD Ryzen 7 5800U, NVIDIA RTX 3050Ti graphics card, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Wi-Fi 6, and it's thin, lightweight and pretty sleek looking. It can play games or crush productivity work, has a really crisp full HD display (though it only gets up to 300 nits brightness), and has a decent port selection - two USB-A, USB-C, HDMI, headphone, & power."
2265,"Acer Swift X SFX14-41G-R1S6 Creator Laptop | 14"" Full HD 100% sRGB | AMD Ryzen 7 5800U | NVIDIA RTX 3050Ti Laptop GPU | 16GB LPDDR4X | 512GB NVMe SSD | Wi-Fi 6 | Backlit Keyboard | Windows 10 Home (ASIN: B093TK1PXF)"
2266,This laptop seemed fine for a while but then the left-side USB port stopped working. I spent many frustrating hours trying to install an Entrust data card until realizing it was the port. I found Acer's support website difficult to navigate. Finally got through and returned the unit. I clearly explained to the chat agent the issue. And I clearly wrote down the issue on slip of paper and included with the unit. Unit comes back from some facility in Texas - NOT fixed! Same exact problem.
2267,"I've learned to trust Acer brand. My Acer PC is still working great and the Acer laptop that I've replaced with the Acer Swift, still works fine. It's just way out of date."
2268,I had gotten this laptop for college and a bit of side gaming. It works like a charm! I knew the specs were pretty good and I didn't really expect it to be this good. Overall good laptop
2269,"I did not receive a unit with Win10 on it, despite it stating Win10 in the specs. Ignoring that, it has a solid build and solid performance. I do hate the nuisances of Win11, it's like a reskinned Win10, but with extra steps. I'm keeping it for now as I need the laptop, but will remain slightly disappointed. I was hoping to skip this OS until the next one (Win12?), but I'll give it a shot a little longer."
2270,"Aside from a ton of bloatware and missing drivers which I fixed with AVG, the laptop felt great. Very light, as they claim. Battery life is pretty average, maybe above than average."
2271,"This is by far one of the best Windows laptops I have ever owned. It came with minimal bloatware (much of which I cleaned up upon receiving the laptop) and the memory and processor performance of my personal laptop keep up with high loads: multiple virtual machines running, WSL running Linux, Firefox, VSCode, Spotify, Teams and Outlook run almost constantly on my laptop with no gaps in work or delays from loading."
2272,I went for this laptop because I didn't want to have to move to Windows 11.  The listing needs to be updated as this machine does not have Windows 10 Home as advertised.
2273,"An absolute beast of a laptop in a little package. My only gripe is that it's advertised to come with Windows 10, but it instead came with Windows 11. That should be updated!"
2274,"Bought this as an early birthday present for my wife. Runs as good if not better than her gaming tower but she can take it in the living room. Runs great after i did a fresh windows install. Almost tempted to buy one for myself. Battery life when gaming isn’t amazing, but what laptop is? Its great for its size."
2275,I'm on my third laptop and each time the wifi card disappears after 2-3 months. This time I'm outside the return period so I'm unable to exchange with Amazon and will have to deal directly with Acer. Don't buy this.
2276,There are essentially two laptops available that serve the niche the Acer Swift X exists in; the other is the ASUS ROG Flow X13. That notebook is $300 more expensive...on sale.
2277,"Battery life was a major feature I was excited about, disappointing. And when charging, literally half the computer gets too hot to touch. Battery life is about an hour n a half when playing a game. Windows 11 is buggy and mediocre at best"
2278,Laptop is really looking elegant and its lightweight.  Its perfect for both office type of work to high demanding apps like adobe. I also played on it several modern games and they worked like charm! However this laptop has been purchased only for work stuff so its really doing the job great!
2279,All is good w/exception of being advertised at Windows 10 operating system.... it's Windows 11.  Not happy yet will live w/it mainly because I had techs transfer files and they told me it was Windows 11.  Sure it could b returned but it would b my cost to offload files.  It's quick.  Lightweight.
2280,"Por el precio que pagué es  una maquina espectacular para creadores. El diseño es limpio y bonito, la pantalla se ve preciosa, es liviana y le dura bastante la bateria 10/10. Mi trabajo de como creadora de contenidos para redes sociales"
2281,I got this for personal and light work use. I do some freelance work and this performs well and manages many tabs open and can process through downloads without slowing. Haven’t had any issues with graphics. Keyboard lights up and feels smooth under the finger tips. I like the color BUT I do have some
2282,"Overall, it has good performance and a good battery life. I am happy with the screen. The only drawback I can think of is that the fans can be occasionally noisy but I think the pros (price/performance) outweigh a little bit of noise. It does everything that I need it to and the keyboard/trackpad are pretty good."
2283,"Muy buena compra, no pesa mucho, es minimalista, muy rapida, elegante la batería dura mucho. Lo único que no me parece es que solo tiene 2 puertos USB, y no tiene puerto Ethernet."
2284,"Considering the internal specs of this model, it's a good deal, especially if you get it on sale. The 3050Ti GPU in this unit has a TGP of just 40W, which is on the low end, but given the compact chassis, it's hardly surprising. Nonetheless, this machine is more than capable of doing some gaming, but you won't be running Cyberpunk 2077 on Ultra settings with raytracing, obviously. Haha."
2285,The combination between the fast Ryzen 7 CPU and the RTX 3050Ti GPU make the computer's performance amazing. Additionally the 16 GB RAM and 512 GB SSD makes it a perfect combination. The reason I'm giving this 4 stars is because I had some minor problems with the WiFi card and some problems with Windows 11. It has amazing battery life and it provides a great gaming experience for what it's worth.
2286,Laptop arrived with issues. Frequently reboots itself and goes into recovery mode. A clean reinstall of Windows did not fix the problem. Memory tests fine as does the SSD. There is an error when I try to return it for replacement which I assume is stock related. I will be returning this for a refund and getting something else.
2287,The laptop has a ryzen 7 processor and a 3050 Ti for the price you honestly couldn't get a product that offers more than the acer swift x. I cannot recommend this product because the moment I turned it on the fan just started kicking in and would never stop. I tried pressing Fn+F to put the laptop on quiet mode and the fan will slow down for 2 seconds before sounding loud again. I honestly can't use the laptop to study because the fan noise is too distracting especially when you connected it to an external monitor.
2288,"I used the computer for two months and the battery life was great. I can take it for class at noon and keep using it for programming and taking notes till 6pm with still around 30% power left. It can only work for two hours when playing pc games, but I play them at home and can charge whenever I like. And it’s light. I can hardly feel it when I take it in my backpack."
2289,"Has some good specs and good performance, but as others have mentioned the fan is way too loud. Like this is a serious faulty issue. The noise sounds like they're grinding metal inside the laptop. Returning immediately and likely getting a Dell XPS."
2290,"This is a review of Acer Swift X SFX14-41G-R1S6 Creator Laptop | 14"" Full HD 100% sRGB | AMD Ryzen 7 5800U | NVIDIA RTX 3050Ti Laptop GPU | 16GB LPDDR4X | 512GB NVMe SSD | Wi-Fi 6 | Backlit Keyboard | Windows 10 Home."
2291,"Very excellent for what I have it for. I like to be able to play AAA games on moderate settings, and the 3050ti delivers. But I also write and read a lot, and some programming, so the long battery life is very useful."
2292,"I bought this computer by the advices of some friends and I don't regret it, is really fast, the battery might be kind of weird sometimes, but overall it does the job, would recommend."
2293,"The laptop works great with an awesome battery life. My budget was around $1,300 and this laptop with an RTX 3050ti and a 8 core processor. I’m a student and I needed a lightweight laptop and I knew that this was my choice. The laptop have a responsive keyboard and a sturdy chasis. The camera is not that great but it works so I don't mind."
2294,"The laptop comes with all the hardware I needed at a reasonable price point. It's not too heavy and has a solid build quality. The keyboard is responsive, however the PgUp and PgDn keys are close to the left and right arrow keys."
2295,"The laptop arrived non-functional. I couldn't figure out the issues for the life of me, but it had an earlier release of Win 11, so I wiped that for Win 10 and once it was all updated it was smooth sailing on Sea of Thieves and nice shots on Rocket League. I've got Davinci and Reaper installed and they all work excellently too, and the extra NVMe slot was perfect to add some storage for audio/video/games."
2296,This laptop has worked great for me for school work. I have run into no problems or bottlenecks even when I try and do some gaming on it. Overall I would recommend this to anyone that wants a great quality thin and light that has some serious horsepower under the hood for all of your gaming or creation needs.
2297,"This laptop is fast, lightweight, and has great battery life. The only problem was that the charger components did not fit together. However, acer can replace it. Overall a great purchase."
2298,This laptop is perfect for students. It's only 3lbs very light weight but contain 3050ti which is great. Ryzen 7 and what not. It has sRGB which produces accurate colours. It's perfect for editing also. Battery backup is pretty good. It looks dope in goldan colour. Do buy it.
2299,"This laptop is perfect at nothing, but great at everything. It can run intensive games well, it can be used for typing well, and pretty much anything else a laptop should do, this is good at doing. Overall, it's one of the best laptops for students, especially if you want a super subtly secret gaming laptop that looks like a typical laptop."
2300,"the laptop feels solid, it's thin & light + so powerful, it has great CPU with 8 cores and 16 threads + decent GPU 3050 ti . it means that i can edit my 4k videos with no problem. the keyboard is good, the screen is not glossy which is nice, sound quality is average. overall I'm very happy with this laptop."
2301,"I was looking for an upgrade to my old laptop and I didn't want to pay an exorbitant price for an ultrabook. After a thorough internet (and Youtube) search, I found the Acer Swift X. I just think this laptop is amazing. You get a pretty light, compact, well built and with great specs laptop, for a reasonable price."
2302,I was looking for a 14 inch laptop for my programming classes that wouldn’t break the budget. I found this laptop and decided to buy it. It’s good for multitasking and programming. You can also play games in 1080p. I did decide to add a WD Black SSD to store my games. I think this laptop is a great deal without spending a lot of money.
2303,I love this laptop.  3.06 lbs and it can run triple-a games (with lower settings).  You don't even need to carry around the charger.  It supports USB-C power delivery up to 100w (i tested it with a watt meter) so you can have one charger for all of your devices saving even more weight.
2304,"Although the computer satisfies my needs, it is certainly without its flaws. The speakers are terrible - downward-facing, with no depth. I had a audio popping issue due to power distribution which I eventually fixed by adjusting the power plan. The charging cable is also a bit flimsy and stresses me out quite a bit."
2305,"I got this for one purpose and one purpose alone: gaming. I use my Mac for mostly everything else (web surfing, light coding, work stuff, etc.), but obviously the Mac can't fill the gaming itch that PC's have enjoyed for decades. Admittedly, I don't game too much on PC because I usually play on my Switch and PS5, but there have been a ton of Steam gems I've wanted to try out over the years that I never got the chance to."
2306,My new Acer Swift X SFX14-41G-R1S6 Creator Laptop did not work. The screen was black and did not work. I returned the computer to amazon and got a refund. I chose to buy a different laptop as a replacement.
2307,"My only complaints are the lack of an SD card slot, and non upgradable ram. Build quality is a lot better than others are making it out to be. Speakers are OK, a little bit on the quiet side but still usable. Battery life is awesome, averaging 8-9 hours of light to moderate use. Get this if you want something independent from a wall outlet but still very capable. Sure, there are more powerful laptops out there for the price at the sacrifice of weight and battery life. Then again, this is an Ultrabook, not a gaming laptop."
2308,"The Acer Swift X is well priced laptop with plenty of power that could be dialed down to last a whole day. The laptop might looks simple and bland, with the silver aluminum chassis, but the Ryzen 7 5800U APU and NVIDIA RTX 3050Ti packs a punch."
2309,Better than I thought it would be. It is super light which is what I wanted. The quality is fine for me. I would buy it again if I needed to
2310,"I liked the size and weight of the laptop plus the specs are very capable. Most games will play just fine and the battery life is pretty good if you plan to use it away from home. My main con is the screen, I thought it could have been better.  It seemed like the contrast was low and the black levels were higher than I'd like. The brightness and colors were decent enough. I would've also liked to see an SD card slot."
2311,"The RAM is soldered in with now expansion sockets! Really Acer? So buy as much RAM as you can get because you're not adding any! It does have two M.2 SSD slots, so that's nice."
2312,"Just got this laptop, and it works like a charm. I love the matte screen, which means there is little light reflection off the screen, and I can afford to lower the screen brightness and save battery. Really helps me as I'm a college student. Not only is it able to process all of my school work, but I am also able to play some games that I couldn't with my old laptop!"
2313,I am a computer science student + work with adobe programs and this laptop really does not struggle with anything. I can carry it around college and not feel like a brick in my back and has a beautiful design!
2314,"This is the best laptop you can buy for the price point especially if you aren’t into bulky gaming laptops but still want to game amongst other things. It has great battery life, good for gaming but the camera and microphone is lacking. I also had a wifi driver issue but that resolved itself and I never saw that issue again. Other than those things extremely happy with my purchase, this will last me years."
2315,"It's 2022 but somehow finding a quality laptop with an excellent backlit keyboard is still difficult. This feature was one of the reasons I purchased this laptop, but if I could do it over again I'd look elsewhere."
2316,Only owned for a short while but the laptop runs very well. The build quality is nice and screen looks great as well. Definitely a good bang for your buck with the specs
2317,Been using this for a week now and it's been doing me wonders. Great for low-end gaming and great for school and normal life activities. The only problem is that the charger is a bit finicky and the fan is a bit loud when gaming but other than that its a 10 outta 10 from me!
2318,"Built quality was better than I expected. Screen is great. Performance has been really good. Very portable. Extra SSD slot is a big plus and is easy to access. Overall great product for the price, I have been more than pleased and I highly recommend."
2319,"The using experience is terrible. The network card is very bad. Just after three months, the device cannot to the WiFi.I call on Acer to get a support, every time they let me to reset the internet. But It cannot work. Just waste my time. And after do that a coup times, the device shows a blue screen and cannot to open. For the repairing, I need to ship it to Acer. A very terrible experience."
2320,"Bit of a nerd alert here - I'm fairly techy and so this review might get a bit in the weeds, but read on if you're interested in a true breakdown of what this thing can do."
2321,"I called Acer support immediately after noticing it would not turn on. They guided me through a few steps, but none that fixed my problem. The support told me that they had received a similar report for this item the 24th of September. For the exact same unit. The same product had been returned and sold again without fixing the problem."
2322,"I've been looking forward to getting an upgraded computer. We found this one after looking for awhile. This product seems to meet all my needs. Gaming, Great Graphics, Portable/ Light weight and reliable battery life."
2323,Worked fine for like a month. Now it blue screens daily and I have to reinstall windows every day. I need this laptop to tour with and theres no way I’ll be using it now. Horrible experience. Looked online and many people have the same issue. Going to try and get the money back because I don't want to have this happen in the middle of a live show on stage.
2324,"I really like how long the battery last, it last me all day if I don’t charge it while I work and it’s also great for the times I want to just chill and game"
2325,"La recibí hace una semana es una bestia, el rendimiento es impresionante un poco más pequeña de lo que esperaba, el teclado no es el más comodo las teclas son un poco pequeñas pero es algo de costumbre."
2326,"It’s too expensive for what you get, a small laptop tgat is kind of slow if you run more than a couple programs. It shouldn’t cost $1200, it should be more on $800 price range. Disappointed."
2327,"I do a lot of video editing and though I love everything Apple creates, I’m not a huge fan of their laptops or desktops.  I grew up using windows and adobe products and I know that macs are supposed to be great for editing videos, but the cost and learning of a new software keep me from making the switch.  This laptop has handled every 4K video I’ve thrown at it and it is super portable which is great as I mostly shoot drone footage.  All around a great laptop."
2328,"Love the speed and sleekness of the machine. After 4 months, the wireless adapter went caput. Completely unrecognizable in the laptop and thus no WiFi. Apparently, it's a more than common issue."
2329,"The performance on this laptop is excellent with it's RTX 3050ti GPU. I am not a heavy gamer, so it is more than enogh to handle my games such as LOL and AOE4. Not to mention this laptop is only about 3lbs with incredible long lasting battery."
2330,I own an acer swift 1 and needed a laptop with more ram and disk space and acer X gave me that plus all the bells and whistles.  Its really loaded easy to setup.  Color is off the charts good and very fast.  I highly recommend.  I received the laptop in 3 days well packaged.
2331,It’s a great laptop with plenty of power to run most popular applications. Battery life is good especially when plugged on to the monitor - I get about 7-8 hours. The only bad aspect is that laptop doesn’t go to sleep.
2332,This laptop has internals of a laptop 300 euros more expensive than it and performs admirably in both office and gaming tasks. It is stylish and feels premium. It has a great keyboard and a decent trackpad. It can easily get 60 faps or more on most games if playing on 1080p High.
2333,"I originally bought a MSI 15M 3060 MAX-Q w/ 11th gen Intel. I’m an casual gamer and that laptop ran VERY HOT, I couldn’t even use it as a “Laptop” without 3rd degree burns. Now this laptop, wow, it runs very cool under load. If you’re looking for something besides a space ship with huge fan vents, this is it."
2334,"I was looking for a laptop good for gaming and work, and this laptop accomplishes a lot of my needs. For all the  great specs that this laptops gives, its truly a jack of all trades laptop. Great battery life, and fast charging. Really light weight laptop, and quite portable. The keyboard and trackpad are not the best, but very reliable and solid. Not much to complain about this laptop."
2335,"This is a fantastic little powerhouse. For an (oh-so-close to 3lb) ultra portable, this little machine packs a punch. It's not a gaming laptop, but can keep up in a pinch, and way outperforms similarly prices rival models. It's exactly what I need in a mix of portability and power."
2336,"We were looking for a great laptop at this pricepoint (around $1k) that would fit our needs in photo and video editing as well as have some room for other things. Needless to say, this laptop has fulfilled these needs and exceeded all expectations!"
2337,"I Just got the laptop a few days ago, and I already really like it. I really like the fingerprint sensor and I like how fast and responsive it is. I am using it for college and it is going to be perfect. I have already recommended this laptop to my friends."
2338,"Decent for the price. It is a very light laptop but has enough power to do some gaming. The screen is good, bright enough for most applications. Would have been nice if it came with Windows 10 Pro."
2339,"I have only used this laptop for 4 weeks and the trashy WiFi card already fails on a regular basis. It has been an issue off and on since I got the laptop. Sometimes I have to reset Windows, sometimes I have to manually reset it by going to hardware devices, disabling it and re-enabling it. Sometimes none of these solutions work so I have to hard reset the laptop by holding down the power button for 30s (""shutdown"" through the Windows tab doesn't cut it)."
2340,"I wouldn't game on it. I would do ok for things that are not gpu intensive. They underclocked the GPU so you don't get the full power out of it but I caught it on sale and it was the cheapest laptop that fit my specs. Works great, great battery life and fantastic to work from home. Only downside are the small compress chiclet keys, but its a laptop."
2341,"Let me say this has great performance. It handled everything i threw at it, playing mid to high gaming with rtx and dsll enabled was cool - while even doing some media consumption and work on the side."
2342,"It's a great laptop for its price. There were issues with the stock Mediatek WiFi adapter. I replaced it with an Intel AX200 adapter and the issues are gone. Build quality is acceptable for its price and specs. It's a great laptop overall. Delivery is really fast, I got it to my hands within a week even if I live outside us. Also, I didn't have to deal with customs. My order was shipped by Amazon via UPS."
2343,"It's what you'd expect. Solid performance from the new, updated CPU/GPUs. I was looking for a more minimal looking laptop with these specs at this price point, and this sort of fit. The chassis is a little outdated in terms of it's design and the trackpad feels a little clunky, but overall a solid laptop."
2344,"What's a laptop with a dead WiFi card ? An expensive paper weight. And it doesn't help when the manufacturer's website cannot identify their own product with the S/N or SNID. Acer is now on my business no-buy list. Decent NVIDIA/AMD power horse for architectural software, but when it fails and can't repair WiFi connectivity, it's just a kid's gaming trinket."
2345,"I bought this Swift X just over one month ago.I immediately upgraded the O/S nvme to 2tb,& added an additional 2tb nvme. I installed steam, Amd Tuning utility, & a custom version of windows 10. Total ram on idle was 1.2g."
2346,"The WiFi module died within the day of delivery. When it was still detected, it wouldn't reliably connect to the internet in both Windows and from a Linux live USB. The overall build quality is quite poor for a $1000+ laptop. The charging plug is laughably fragile and will only connect at certain angles and with a constant push inwards."
2347,"A great replacement for my previous laptop. Longer battery life, better graphics, better performance, quieter (even when playing high fps games), and overall just what I was looking for for its Black Friday cost. Highly recommend for just about everything except if you want to play games at the highest graphics and/or games known to require a lot out of your computer."
2348,"Great price (especially recently discount). It’s quick and easy to set up, lightweight, only 3.06 lbs. Fingerprint scanner is fast. This laptop only has two USB ports, may need to get a USB dock for additional USB ports. Overall I would highly recommend this laptop."
2349,"I bought this computer to use in college, I use some kinda heavy software like sketchup, autocad, photoshop and illustrator. And for these, the computer seems to be doing very well. I really like de design, cause products with similar specs are usually aimed for gamers and the style is usually very agressive an rough. I like that this one is extremely elegant. The sound has some issues, as I have read across other reviews, but I do not need this aspect to be perfect anyway."
2350,This review is primarily for people who prefer GNU/Linux computer operating systems and are familiar with the process of installing such a system on a computer which comes with Microsoft Windows pre-installed.
2351,"I have been looking at several laptops before buying this model. Many pages recommend it, also If you look over the reviews for this model and the 512GB there are many reviews that have been done as a free product. This is ok -marketing' but let's go to my experience."
2352,"I bought a pc because I needed to run windows for my engineering classes. I'm not knowledgeable about windows at all, but this computer has amazing performance all packed in for a great price. I wish that the display was 4k, and that the body was a little more premium, but for the price you cannot beat the top-of the line specs!"
2353,"Product:Acer Swift X SFX14-41G-R1S6 Creator Laptop | 14"" Full HD 100% sRGB | AMD Ryzen 7 5800U | NVIDIA RTX 3050Ti Laptop GPU | 16GB LPDDR4X | 512GB NVMe SSD | Wi-Fi 6 | Backlit Keyboard | Windows 10 Home"
2354,"This is a very light laptop, with many high-end features. Thanks to the AMD Ryzen CPU, the battery life is awesome even with 8cores and 16threads. It is also very fast owing to the SSD, 16GB RAM, and the Ryzen CPU. There is even an NVidia graphics accelerator for playing games or video editing.. if you can part with some of the battery life."
2355,"I found this computer and comparing prices this have a really good hardware, no after I received y ran the PS2 emulator an run very well, I downloaded other videogames and run excelent, all the cover is of metal, and can virtualice the operating systems very quick and easy wit VBox or other virtual hypervisor, it is really fast when executing software, the  RAM can't be expanded but the hard drive yes, so I expanded the other slot to a 1 TB with a gaming SSD NVME, that's how I have now a complete laptop"
2356,"This computer has a lot of potential but the build quality isn't there. It it feels like it should be a $300 laptop in build quality alone. The trackpad on my unit wasn't even level in the computer. I don't have much confidence in Acer's build quality anymore. I think the specs of the computer are pretty good value, but I did hear the fan run quite a bit. The battery life seemed to be okay. I ended up returning this thing going with an Asus ROG Flow X13 which worked much better for me!"
2357,"You really can't beat the price for the quality and power of this laptop. If you do a lot of heavy gaming, the graphics card is OK but not great. But really for anything else this is the one to buy."
2358,The build quality of this Acer Swift is excellent and on pair with every other high-end laptop I have owned. The screen is clear and crisp with no dead pixels.
2359,I got this for work since I'm constantly having to move around. This works great. The only thing that I should have gotten was one with a touch screen. But I don't really need that. I haven't tried to game on it so I don't know what games it will play. But it is fast when moving between programs and having multiple windows open.
2360,"The laptop arrived protected. Upon inspection I didn't liked the choice of colors too much, but its performance is unbearable at this price. The screen could go dimmer when turning the brightness down, but I'm none of those people that tend to use the least amount of backlight on my laptops, so take it with a pinch of salt."
2361,A year after I bought this product it stopped working due to water damage that was there before I bought it and because I bought it renewed the apple store couldn’t do anything to fix it unless I pay like $900. Don’t waste your money
2362,"I was so excited to get this air because I previously owned the MacBook Air 2015 model. I received this product today and noticed a broken key, the ""1"" is jammed and only works when a lot of pressure is applied. disappointing because everything else works great and runs much faster than my old 2015."
2363,"This was an open-box purchase. The end of the micro-usb cable broke off in the first week. Then the power plug itself failed after three weeks. Have had to purchase replacements. Otherwise, the laptop seems to be working fine (fingers-crossed)."
2364,I am currently using it and love it!  I am so glad I bought it as it does just what I need it to do!  I would buy another one just to have an extra - though I don't really need one :-)
2365,"When I received my computer is was absolutely stunning. Perfect everything- but then I discovered the tab key did not operate properly. Then one day it just wouldn’t turn on. It finally did, but I did not think that I should have to deal with that even with a refurbished item. Had to return, to big of a purchase for it not to work properly"
2366,I am a big review person  let me tell you this thing is amazing and it like practically brand new for refurbished not one scratch on it I was very impressed  And it came the day it said I will definitely buy from that seller again
2367,"A little disappointed in the packaging. Came in original MacBook Air box but the box was quite weathered. Made for an anticlimactic presentation and honestly made me concerned that the product would also be subpar. However, the computer seemed to be unblemished and function normally. Did have to reset it recently for acting up. The mouse was not appearing no matter how much you moved on the trackpad. But resetting it resolved the issue."
2368,"I bought two of them, in Gold (sold by BREED), and in Grey (sold by KANGA). The gold/Breed one presented as completely new and was probably renewed by Apple (5 STARS!). The Grey/Kanga was... far from great. Packed poorly, not really properly cleaned, and came with an aftermarket charger - not the Apple one (2 STARS). For some reason I could not write two reviews. The Air itself is a great machine with a gorgeous screen - go for the i5 - the i3 is too weak."
2369,"this is NOT the latest model and does not have the M1 chip which is newest and this is a 2018 model. Why is the ""latest model"" in the desc? That is very misleading + it is a 2018 w 2020 price."
2370,"I'm beyond happy with my purchase!! My MacBook basically looks brand new and everything works very well. no issues at all. Item was delivered within 3 days of my purchase, very fast and safe delivery."
2371,"I bought this thing for my daughter. I tried to convince her to let me buy a similarly priced Lenovo that was 4 times as powerful but she would have none of it. Her friends all use Macs and this one in particular is gold and matches her iPhone. You couldn't have given it to me. FYI, the daughter in question just graduated from medical school. SMH."
2372,"Super malo,estaba en muy mal estado, por fuera como por dentro,y encima me toco pagar para devolverlo, su cargador no era el del PC,eso es una falta de respeto para uno como consumidor. 😡"
2373,I’m not gonna lie. Initially there was an issue with the shipment of my MacBook Air. I frustratingly reached out to customer service thinking it would take days to receive a response (or no response at all). Surprisingly they replied in under 24 hours and handled my concerns with such care & professionalism! Not to mention my MacBook Air came in AMAZING condition. I have no issues and will definitely make another purchase with them soon after the holidays!
2374,I got this MacBook and it has so many issues with it. I cannot use it at all. Even after being on Apple technical support for hours. $1000 down the drain. Husband gave it to me as an anniversary gift a month after getting it. Now can’t return it.
2375,"bought a few days ago.  delivery was yesterday.  I turned it on, installed all the programs, did a little work.  And this morning it does not turn on anymore.  what to do?"
2376,"I am very much in love with my computer, I was really scared to order the computer online but I am so pleased to say that it is real and I am in love."
2377,"Got mine, tried to charge it, never charged or turned on.  It came with a SHARKK charger and it was not working, I went to Bestbuy and bought an apple charger for MacBooks.  Let it charge for over an hour and still would not turn on.  I am not satisfied and I will be returning the laptop and purchasing a new one from Apple.  I should have known better."
2378,The product came dirty and it was damage after one day of use it would freeze constantly and from time to time glitch. The color was nice but the product was not in well conditions. And not all money was refund it was a company's fault not my fault
2379,"The laptop is beautiful!! This is the first Mac I’ve ever had and I am in LOVE!! The display is amazing, crystal clear and there is no blemishes or anything wrong with the laptop. It looks brand new and works perfectly. Thank you!!"
2380,"Absolutely love the sleek look of this MacBook! It was super easy to type on and lightweight, so that I could take my work on the go/ fit it in a small carry on! Recommend, recommend, recommend!!!!"
2381,you can get it with windows11 for 30% less just look around on the net free shipping to i payed more for 10 and got stuck with 11 not happy at all O and it in S mode !
2382,"It is a good laptop for light tasks: office, web surfing, watching videos. Not for more. No coollers = no noise. CPU is weak and after first loading you need few hours to update the system. After this it works good. Laptop has NVMe M2 port inside for adding additional ssd disk. You can not upgrade anything else."
2383,I needed a Windows 10 computer for work.  I thought this would be perfect.  It arrived with Windows 11 running in S mode.  The listing mentioned it would weighed 1 pound which I knew wasn't correct.  Had to return due to the OS issue.
2384,"This laptop is not bad, but it is not very efficient for anything other than checking emails and online schooling. You cannot download games to it as it does not have enough ram, but if you are just doing basic things online then you should be fine. The laptop started having issues after we downloaded Chrome, now it's very slow. If you're just going to use the Explorer Web browser, you should be fine."
2385,"nice inexpensive computer, great except there is a built in calculator in the mouse pad that keeps turning on that makes it impossible to use the touch pad for scrolling etc. I delete the driver and windows reloads it as soon as I shut the computer."
2386,"I’m sorry but it didn’t turn or charge no matter what I did, it was honestly a waste of my time and money. (I don’t mean to sound rude though.)"
2387,"This has got to be the best computer deal I have purchased!!!!  The 14inch screen is great and the size and weight of the computer is amazing. Super fast response, graphics are great and is easily storable!!!  Great buy for the money. I will be buying two more for my kids!!"
2388,For the money this is a great buy. Don't expect too much. I made the mistake of upgrading to Win11 and lost about 5GB of built-in hard disk space (so now I'm down to 25GB). That's not a prob for me since I never keep anything critical on my built-in HD anyway - nor should you :) BTW I always use an external keyboard + mouse (consider a USB hub that will cost you all of $10  I DO appreciate the 2 built-in USB ports.
2389,I didn't even receive the right laptop with the right specs. After setting up the laptop it immediately started beeping really loud and then blew into recovery mode due to not having a hard drive>??? I'm not that tech inclined but I know enough to know what specs a computer does an doesn't have and
2390,"I can't rate the computer because you did not include a power source or tell me I needed one, so-o-o-o-o now I wait a few more days to see if it actually works."
2391,"Don't buy it! Dell won't fix it!  Used at home and less than 60 days the hinge came lose and the screen came apart.  I have to leave it open or it will get worse. After hours on the phone, Dell said the warranty does not cover this issue.  I can see other reviews with the same breakdown. Dell and Amazon are big companies and should try to make it right for consumers. It appears to be a manufacturing fault and should be recalled.  I will never buy another Dell product."
2392,"I could barely set the thing up. It timed out on every screen, every internet search, even with full-strength wifi - and with me sitting right next to the router! I had such high hopes, and I'm entirely disappointed. I got a new computer BECAUSE my old one was slowing down, not to get an even slower one."
2393,This laptop is slower then my old laptop I was replacing that’s 5 years old so I expected much more…  I expected it would be able to play a game on fb.. it’s not like I am playing COD it’s FarmVille for gosh sakes!!
2394,"I'm very happy with this machine it works great, I wished it had touch screen but for the money I can live without it. The clarity is wonderful and so easy to setup.  Life is good for a senior😊😊"
2395,"the internal battery lasted 2-4 days and wont recharge. its not dell, its the battery. i will never buy a laptop unless i can order a replacement  battery. in of story  . p s  i bought a IBM a year ago, the touch screen is junk,  dots that wont stop."
2396,"It's a good solid laptop! I needed an extra for work and then my primary broke so now this one is the one. In fact it is the one I am typing this review on, lol. The 10-key is great also. The picture quality is good for the price."
2397,Buyer beware - I bought this laptop specifically because it is advertised as running Windows 10 as that is what I needed to run a specific software program. It comes preinstalled with Windows 11.
2398,"I needed a new laptop for a class, after owning my old laptop FOR YEARS. Dell Inspiron has a Beautiful 15+"" display & was exactly what I needed: Spill proof keyboard, fast processor, great basic storage & functionality (I'm not an IT pro). Definitely recommend it."
2399,"I've always LOVED Dell Desktop computers. I've had several throughout many years. But I'd never heard anything about Dell laptops. Knowing that Dell makes the best desktops (in my opinion!), I decided to try the laptop. I couldn't believe how fast I fell in love with this laptop. I've had it for over a month now, using it for several hours each day & I have only found 2 problems with it:"
2400,I do not like the laptop. It is the worse I have ever had. It shuts down and will not come back on unless you are typing. Then you have to keep rebooting. Warning- I would not buy again. Don't waste your money.
2401,"This is the perfect computer for someone needing a home computer or work and school computer.  It's lightweight, fast, and can do multiple tasks.  What I like best is how fast it starts up.  Zero loading time when you turn it on and I like how easy it transitions between apps.  I don't do gaming but I do stream and it is smooth and loads fast. I've had several other brands and so many were disappointing.  This one is a keeper."
2402,"& wanted two good search engines, but Was frustrated by all the roadblocks thrown in by the hype telling me how good MICROSOFT EDGE was. i just could not load GOOGLE. I finally returned the Laptop."
2403,"As expected. It is fantastic! Light weight and well made. It performs smooth and quietly. We just needed a laptop for day to day office work and we had a small budget. The price was unbelievable and the performance has my two tombs up. The delivery was made way ahead of time, the package was well wrapped and padded. Wow! Thank you."
2404,ing. This one is perfect for that. It's not touch screen which I didn't want any ports. I found set up to be really easy and  don't mind any of those
2405,"I'm about to finish law school and I've had this laptop throughout my tenure. Being in law school and addicted to old 90's video games at the same time, I've spent more hours than I can count on this thing. I also stream movies/shows to my TV through the HDMI, and rock dual screens with a portable second screen. I usually have at least 10 tabs open for research, a few word documents open, run a really expensive adobe program, and play music at the same time and this thing can handle it."
2406,I bought the 2012 iteration of this models series and stopped using it on 2018. I stopped using it because it started getting heavy and slow. If I actually made an effort I would have probably been able to tweak it so it would go faster. The touchscreen feature is really nifty (especially in 2012/13) but this makes the screen heavier and dirtier. I believe for what its worth you get a lot for your money. Even being a budget friendly laptop I was able to game on it and use it as my daily driver.
2407,"The computer didn’t work when it arrived, after much hassle with Dell we returned it for a new hard drive - the ‘fixed’ one doesn’t work at all, not even the keyboard!! Worst product ever."
2408,"Returned as soon as I finally got to open the computer and look at the specs.  Processor was slower (1.1 GHz vs 1.4 GHz\1.6GHz) than advertised and the hard drive was smaller (128 GB vs 500 GB) than advertised.  There is conflicting specifications when this computer is compared with similar ones.  I'm going to stick with purchasing directly from the manufacturer.  I would have been hugely disappointed if I had paid the original purchase price of $1,000."
2409,Dell won't give a service warrantee but charges a higher price because of the length time since the vendor bought this..  The vendor did not mention this.  I recommend buying Dell computers directly from Dell.
2410,If you are just going to use it for emails and social media this is perfect for that.  If you are looking for speed for gaming etc. this is probably not the one for you.
2411,"I use this for personal and business computing at home - currently independent contractor.  Screen size is good - can use stand-alone (when I travel) but add larger screen at home for second screen.  Keyboard is also fine for travel, which again I supplement at home with separate key board.  Could have used more ports but extension ports seem work fine.  I am not a Google fan so the Microsoft suite (Excel, Word, Outlook, etc.) work fine for me - although Edge I am not crazy about.  Google and other aps work fine."
2412,"I haven’t bought a Dell in well over a decade because I’ve never had a good experience with them. Thought I’d give them a second chance 2022. It’s an impossibly slow laptop, to the point that I was almost nostalgic for dial-up internet. Not happy about having to pay to return this junk but it would have been an expensive paperweight if I kept it. Lesson learned - no more Dells."
2413,"Do not buy dell laptops , the hinges come loose and then the hinge catches the frame around the screen and screen, then dell won’t pay for repair, say it’s not covered, only had laptop 2 months"
2414,"Nothing wrong w/the laptop except for the way it was advertised.  I specifically ignored laptops that had Windows 10S.  This one was advertised as Windows ""Home"" - which it is, but running in S mode.  S mode is a real pain and getting out of S mode once it's on there isn't straightforward either."
2415,"we were looking for a lap top, to take with us when we travel, this computer is great!, light weight, large screen, and simple to use.  I always loved Dell, and, this fits all of our needs!"
2416,"I did not discover until I got through setup that this machine has Windows 11 Home installed, not Windows 10 as advertised. That matters because Windows 11 may not work with some of my legacy apps on a hardware platform as limited as this. There was NO indication on the box or the machine itself as to which version was installed. It even arrived without ANY paperwork inside the box, not even a rudimentary setup guide."
2417,I needed a new laptop for work since l am working from home..l like a lot it’s fast and light weight the set up was very easy..and the price was not bad either..
2418,Never loads when i actually need it to. It is so glitchy I have constantly missed zoom calls. The price is alright it worked for the first couple of months but after that it did not. Not worth my money or my time
2419,"Ordered this as a gift for my mother for Christmas and upon powered up it said hard drive not installed. It took me a month, several phone calls, several emails, plenty of fights between Amazon and Dell neither wanted to help fix this!!!"
2420,I did not realize that there was no CD-ROM drive nor that the keyboard did not light up for easy to see keys. I don't see too well and that would have helped me out alot. And I guess I assumed that all laptops would have some sort of CD drive. Pay closer attention to things that you might take for granted.
2421,"20 days after we received this laptop, the hinges holding the screen onto the body of the computer broke. We were not using the laptop on a daily basis and we were not abusing the laptop in any way; so this is obviously a defect with the manufacturer. The seller, GamerLand Express, has a high rating based on the website, so hopefully they are not at fault for the problem."
2422,I was so glad that I purchased this new laptop from Amazon. The price was affordable and works great. The anti-virus was a feature that was at a very great price. It is still working great after about almost a year!
2423,"I am very happy with the laptop. Since all of the wireless mouse, that I have gotten, were not a success, it was great to find that, all I need use is a finger. Plus, it does have USB 2.0 (socket) that allows me to my corded mouse, and my printer."
2424,I’m always hesitant with purchasing electronics on any marketplace (I.e Amazon ) but everything is perfect and exactly what I’ve been looking for. It’s worth the money you’ll spend on it for sure! If you’re anything like me I know you have to scroll through a few more reviews to be convinced but trust me when I tell you if ANYTHING and I mean ANYTHING was wrong from the time I purchased to the time I received my laptop I would say it. It also came super quick.
2425,I bought this computer for my dad.  He uses it mostly for paying bills and searching the internet.  It's perfect for that.  It also has a camera.  I think I'm going to get myself one too.
2426,It is unbelievably slow. The computer itself looks nice but the reaction is way too slow. My son would rather use his old broken Accer laptop instead. I don’t know what I can do. It is totally idle and waste. Is it possible to sell it back to the seller with a discount?
2427,"No touch screen, that’s ok, you will have warning come up after starting due to the power charger pack. It needs a larger power pack charger. The one I have is to weak."
2428,"Within less than 6 months the computer wouldn't charge unless the charger was wiggled in just the right way. I contacted Dell and they told me it wasn't covered because it fell under ""normal wear and tear"". There is nothing normal about a device not charging properly after less than 6 months of light use."
2429,"Still can not plug in earphones and get them to work. Very slow. Purchased for my wife, she is not happy with it. Not happy with them trying to force Mcafee down our throat. Also tried to use recommended Edge as a browser. Tried it and it kept popping up porn advertisements and trying to force Mcafee on us again, even after I had deleted it. Switched to Firefox. This may be one of the worst purchases I have ever made."
2430,Dell Inspiron 3583 15” Laptop Intel Celeron – 128GB SSD – 4GB DDR4 – 1.6GHz - Intel UHD Graphics 610 - Windows 10 Home in S Mode - Inspiron 15 3000 Series -
2431,"I had issued with the microphone at first but was able to run some diagnostic tests and it has been restored to whole. Overall, a good product for the price."
2432,When I received the laptop it powered up got it all set up and it was running fine. Today two or three weeks later it would not power up. I had a Tech look at it and he determined that the laptop was dead and useless. Unfortunately my return window has passed so I'm out a little over $300 for a laptop that doesn't work
2433,"I ordered this laptop in June for a new job I started. I was to be working hybrid, home on Tues/Thurs and in the Office MWF. My old laptop was a janky Lenovo from college that just needed to go, so I did some digging and found this laptop. The reviews were solid, and the price wasn't steep at all so I went for the purchase."
2434,"Got this just for my zoom meetings. The screen is cheap and blurry, but this stays put at my webcam table so I dont hv to move my better computer."
2435,Going over the specs I came to realize it wasn’t going to have that much more storage than I already had in my older laptop. So I returned this item.
2436,"I bought the laptop for my job, and I waste my money, is really slow and the most significant is the space that I show in the picture, when I push 2 times for open any document doesn't work, I think 2star is a good review for this product"
2437,I ordered this laptop to replace an older HP that has a failing hinge where the screen connects to the base.  I specifically wanted a computer with Windows 10 Home without the WIndows 10-S version because I prefer certain third party applications.  Well the description says Windows 10 Home but it is the -S version.  Not a big deal but misleading and I had to connect to the Microsoft store to get the version I wanted.
2438,"Experienced a a Microsoft Scam one day after delivery.  Related to ""When I purchased the computer it was to have Security Hardware on it.  Did not per the scammer.  Needed to send $99.95 to get the refund from Microsoft.  Hah!""  Not sure why this would happen immediately after delivered.  I was not on new computer.  So scammer did not know"
2439,"I ordered 2 laptops for my sons. Within a month, one had a hinge failure, the second machine now has a hinge failure after 4 months. The first machine was repaired, but took about 6 weeks to receive back. It's inexcusable, considering this is a basic part that should be perfected by this point in Dell's manufacturing."
2440,"Just got the laptop a month ago. I really love it. Very convenient to use. We even installed Wi-Fi and A Virtual Private Network with it. Now, I don't have to worry about using too much data on my smartphone or waiting to use my desktop PC when I get back home to New York."
2441,Used it for two weeks ran great now everytime I attempt to use it it says “hard drive not found” in the middle of me attempting to get something done. Waste of money.
2442,"First off, I got an HP laptop which I was I was fine with but wasn’t expecting. Opened the box and it had a thank you card from Walmart-interesting. Was using it once while doing school work, it went into sleep mode and never turned back on. Very very frustrated and disappointed."
2443,I have just had the computer for  2 weeks and it will not turn on !! When i called dell they said i need to call amazon . I am very frustrated! This seems ti be a problem with this type of computer if you google it
2444,"The ""Watchdog violation"" has been seen on Window's stop code extraction. Did just a Windows update (Win11) procedure. The only third-party software installed to the moment is the Googe Drive. Yet don't know the root of problem. The hard fault happened on Wi-Fi connection changing from established 5G to 2.5G within same router area."
2445,this is the worse computer I've ever had...I the middle of setting up it froze and it been 5 hours and I can't shut it down...and cant get up hpI've callHP and he was it still can;yt get it started...terrible product
2446,Bought/Set this up for a family member who just needed a very basic laptop. Laptop works fine but was disappointed that it doesn't actually come with Windows 11 already loaded. It boots and gets you connected to the Internet and THEN it downloads and installs Windows 11.
2447,"I bought this for my Nephew. He likes it a lot, but he is a writer and he had to install and pay for a word program. I don't know why laptops don't offer something simple for writing purposes. Other than that, he is pleased with the laptop."
2448,"This computer has me waiting 30 minutes just to search up something, the color is very trashy gray and dull, it is also false advertisement of 256 gbs of storage. This is the worst laptop I have ever owned."
2449,"This computer seems to work fine. I thought from the photos it had an SD card reader, but it just has a slot for one so I have to use a separate card reader."
2450,"HP has a home run with the average, non gaming user. Just wanted a quick boot up and won’t  burn my legs laptop at a reasonable price.  Rips through all my programs with ease. I am very satisfied."
2451,"For what it is, it's pretty good, a ryzen 5 with an SSD and a fhd screen for 400 is honestly impressive. I hate the fact that windows 11 was installed by default, so I moved to Fedora Linux as soon as I was to. I haven't tried any gaming, but I can confidently say it won't run much. Definitely a better choice than a chromebook."
2452,"La panatalle trajo un detalle. Un punto claro que se nota cuando el fondo es oscuro. La bateria no dura mas de cuatro horas y tiene un problema que, creo es de configuracion, que no me deja colocar el acento. Le hago los ajuses en idioma, la reinicio y todo bien. Al pasar dos minutos, vuelve con el mismo problema. Me siento decepcionada. No se como hacer para solicitar un cambio, pues la compre desde Venezuela."
2453,"The only problem I have is that the processing is not as good with windows 11, the rest of the PC is fine it's light it's ryzen 5. I do realize that I needed a graphic card though"
2454,"After seeing so many rough reviews I was a bit skeptical myself, but no worries this laptop is lovely! I'm months in and currently typing up this review on it. The keyboard is fantastic and satisfying. The mousepad is super responsive and has even a left and right side that have different features. Although the screen is not my favorite it still works well. This computer performs magically, but I do recommend installing extra ram onto this to rock its full potential. Overall beastly computer, take my word for it!"
2455,"The AMD Ryzen 5 chip gives this laptop great performance and battery life. Both the CPU and especially the built-in GPU perform very well. Also, it really doesn't get hot nor draw much battery during operation. A very good performing inexpensive laptop overall."
2456,"I did not get a 8gb. It was 4gb, blue, and extremely slow. The entire laptop felt like a child's toy. The screen was impossible to see. The quality overall was horrendous. I love HP, but was beyond disappointed with this product."
2457,"As you can see in the image, the screen presents this problem and it is more visible when the background is white or light, I have not used a lot this laptop and it started to present this problem for some reason."
2458,"Best priced laptop. AMAZING battery life and quick charge. You get everything you want in a simple but powerful computer without having to pay for the ""premium"" of a top brand name, or the ""premium"" of an Intel Chip. Thing works just fine -- one glitch is I have to often restart my laptop (takes like 30 seconds max) to initially connect to my WiFi ... maybe an easy fix?"
2459,"This is a great computer for the value and I am happy with the purchase but, when the computer arrived, it was missing the 3 prong connector jack for the plug to outlet. Please take note as I had to wait another two days and purchase this part."
2460,"This laptop did surprise me. The Ryzen 5 mobile CPU is rather good and the 8GB of RAM that it comes with is more than sufficient if you only plan on doing simple tasks - office work, watching videos on video websites, etc."
2461,"I never really take my laptop anywhere so I never really rely on it for on the go, I’ve bought this so I can run emulators on my laptop and the limit of this pc seems to be The ps3 emulator, so everything before it should run fine. That’s for people that care about that but overall a solid Investment for me"
2462,"It's a basic laptop that you can use for work. Comes with Windows 11 and you then buy Office. It's really lightweight - almost exactly as light as the MacBook Air. So if you don't want to spend a lot on a laptop and you only use it for basic stuff like Office, YouTube and web surfing and you are not too finicky about specs then it's a great choice. The AMD Ryzen is pretty fast - kinda faster than Intel IMO."
2463,"I do shirt design and am a college student so I definitely use my computer a lot, this computer functions well and is pretty fast. The battery last me maybe 6 hours and is very lightweight."
2464,Bought this one for our son thats attending ASU for engineering. Added another 8G memory stick and this thing is a very capable workhorse. I need one for work travel and look forward to using it daily. Don't hesitate on hitting the button. You will not be disappointed.
2465,"I loved everything about this laptop.  It was great until I went to turn it on the other day and though the light indicating it was starting up went on, it quickly went off and it has not worked since.  Since it is a laptop, I was advised it would be cheaper to buy a new one rather than fix this one.  Very disappointed!"
2466,I ended up returning it because it doesn’t have an ethernet port.  I didn’t know that not all computers have one.  It seemed like it would be a great computer for a casual user.
2467,"Excelente equipo! Prácticamente todo lo que ofrecen sin embargo no tiene el teclado Retro-iluminado como dice en las características para su venta. (Deberían cuidar ese detalle) , de resto, es muy rápida, la pantalla me encanta, excelente calidad y la batería tiene una gran duracion"
2468,Good specs for this mid-level laptop.  Perfect for my kid heading off to college.  It has all that is needed except maybe an additional upgrade in RAM needed in the next year or two.
2469,"Really good specs for a laptop. I did purchase another stick of 8 gb ram, not too bad to install, just be patient when removing bottom panel. Cinebench score of 5299, which for a mobile processor is not bad. Plan on using with an external monitor, external keyboard, external mouse for CPA/business/tax work. Cheaper than buying a small form factor desktop."
2470,"I like how lightweight it is, the ram is upgradeable & so is the SSD drive! I have always been partial to HP; my last 4 computers have been HP's. I find them to be reliable and I am hoping this one is too. It drains the battery faster than I would like, but it could be my settings, I will keep you all posted. Thank you, Amazon!!!"
2471,"I got this simply to acquaint myself with Windows 11 as my desktop could not be upgraded.  So far for the budget price it was a good choice, so I'm not surprised the keyboard has a flimsy feel.  It does what I need it to do as a backup device and to get familiar with Windows 11.  My opinion on Win 11 is still out."
2472,"As for as a laptop, that is all it is. The headphone jack stopped working after 3 months. The battery is meh, it drains pretty quickly if the laptop is off or in sleep. It takes forever to turn on, I legitimately thought it was broken when I first received it because of that. It also takes forever to come out of sleep. The review mentioned a touch screen, I don't think it has one. If it does, mine does not work."
2473,"Ok so overall this laptop is a decent, practical, all-around laptop. Not great, but good enough. If you’re a deal hunter and are good at what you do, I guarantee you can find better."
2474,"Tenia duda del procesador AMD, acoostumbrado a Intel por mucho tiempo pero es super rapida, la bateria dura bastantes horas. No es tactil pero los colores de la pantalla son geniales. Viene con Windows 11"
2475,This laptop is really good and fast. I just upgraded the ram 8gb to 16gb crucial ram and also 1tb sss crucial. Now this thing is butter. Good to buy
2476,I’m glad I tried this laptop. It gave me an appreciation for my 5-year-old model that has more speed and memory. I returned it knowing that I should buy at least an equivalent replacement. I’m not a gamer and
2477,"We needed a computer that was light and portable for school. This ticked all the boxes for what we were looking for, and we bought it and a additional stick of ram. It works well, performance is plenty."
2478,"Speedy and powerful, I can finally play Genshin Impact. Great battery life and fast to update with a lot of storage. The internet reception isn't very good on it though."
2479,Add another compatible 8GB 3200 RAM (about $40) and upgrade to a fast 1TB-2TB NVMe SSD ($60-$200). I play Fallout4 with a mix of med to mostly high settings with no lag.
2480,"The laptop is fine  but I'm deducting a star because the keyboard is not backlit.  I own three very similar HP latptops purchased through Costco over the past two years.  The Costco laptops were Intel powered i3 and i5 machines with the same 250 nits 14"" FHD screens, SSDs and backlit keyboards.  This unit is very similar however it is AMD powered and the keyboard is not backlit.  I tried my best to ensure that it was however I could not confirm on the web.  So let me be the first to confirm it is not."
2481,"Everything came fine, box was sealed and undamaged but when it was opened I notice this huge scratches at the back. Somewhat displeased because I know this is a new system but now it feels like a used device"
2482,"I like the size and weight and was really surprised how easy it was to set up and transfer from my other computer. My biggest disappointment is no touchscreen. I'd be lying if I said I don't miss my touchscreen because I do but that was my mistake, I thought it was a touchscreen, it is not. It's a little bit slow on the startup but functions well so far in everything I use it for. So far so good."
2483,I'm a Gmail guy I have a Gmail account I don't want to change.....good luck getting past all the Microsoft monopoly malware to install chrome as a browser...super slow also
2484,"I got this for school as an online college student and I love it!... So far. I've only had it a few days but it works great! It runs fast, I love that the keys are big and don't on them. It's lightweight and the screen is a good size. All and all I'm very pleased."
2485,"When the computer isn't plugged in, the laptop won't turn on. If you fully charge it, then put it to sleep..When you open it the next day the battery will be dead and it won't turn on. What good is a laptop if it always has to be plugged in? Useless. Trying to figure out how to contact HP about the one year warranty. It's ridiculous how hard they make it."
2486,Flimsy and breaks from falling less than 2 ft on a carpeted floor :-(  HP will not honor any repair on accidental damage.  My laptop was less than a month old when it happened. I sent it to them and HP quoted $619 to repair my $500 laptop.  I will never buy HP again.
2487,Produst was as expected but I ordered 2 laptops and only one came with shipment. Had to find out why and apparently warehouse only had one but there was no communication so 1 daughter happy and other disappointed as we had to order a different one from another seller.
2488,I needed a smaller computer. My desktop took up too much space on my desk while working from home. This laptop has been great. I can put it away when not being used and put it in my bag and take it with me when traveling for work. I would buy it again.
2489,"Bought this for simple audio recording and it is amazing for that. It is very snappy out of the box, but I did upgrade it with another 8 gig stick of ram for future proofing. I would wholly suggest it for any type of workstation duties."
2490,Its good for basic gaming but anything like vr or final fantasy will not be playable unless you take out the entire motherboard and get a new one so you might as well get a better more expensive laptop because thats gonna cost about the same
2491,I wanted to give this Laptop 5 starts but the battery life is no good. In just 20 mins I lose 10% battery power even when it runs on balanced. Overall a great and powerful little computer. Lightweight and excellent screen quality. Do I recommend buying? Yes.
2492,"So far I have had no problems. The speed is good. I have a second memory card that I haven't installed yet, but will soon. As fast as it is now, I can only imagine how much better it will be. Will give another update later."
2493,"Got this for my daughter after all of the chromebooks in the house died. It's the perfect size/weight, and has enough spec to run all of her games and schoolwork. She loves it!"
2494,"I like this laptop, but it is hard to see the letters on the keys. You can barely see them standing straight overtop the keyboard.  I wish I had returned it, but I've already downloaded personal stuff on it."
2495,This is feedback from my Daughter who I had it sent to as a gift. HP is typically good equipment. The components and spec in the AD appear to be a solid unit for it's intended purpose. I'll send an update upon hearing further information.
2496,So far no issues and it functions as it should. Bought this for my daughter for online school and she loves it. Wish it had a backlight for the keyboard but otherwise I have no issue with it. Great speed and easy to navigate.
2497,"The product page for the HP 15-dy5024nr is unremarkable, in that it does not really let you know what product line this HP laptop is part of.  It's also tough to know exactly what the specs of this laptop are, without getting one."
2498,I will give it some more time I guess but am really considering sending this back.  I can't believe how crappy the screen quality is.  My 5+ year old fire tablet has better video quality than this thing.  The last laptop I bought was in 2010... is it a requirement now that you need to spend $1000+ for anything decent?
2499,So much faster than any laptop I have had! I had to get one with lots of RAM and SSD. This would have been a bargain at twice the price!
2500,"Awkward to use. crosshair attaches to anything it gets close to. I don't want a computer deciding what I am doing. Highlights text at most inopportune times, not at my direction. Frustrating to use. Ikons too small."
2501,"Got this for my college Freshman daughter, she absolutely loves it!! So light to carry around campus, fast connections, and the battery lasts all (class) day. Not to mention all the non class things she does( Facebook, reading, streaming, ETC)"
2502,"Not good. The keys were loose and the plastic holding the keys in place was warped and very flimsy.  The overall feel of the computer is very cheap for the price tag.  I couldn't say much about the battery or specs because to be honest, I opened it up and noticed straight out the box it was such low quality. I Just sent it back for a refund."
2503,Who ever thought of silver keys with light gray numbers and letters should lose their job. Barely visible even if your are directly looking at them. Almost makes me feel like returning it just for that reason. Other than that it's a decent computer.
2504,A big thanks to Techno Panda on YouTube for the review and recommendation. I added another 8 GB RAM as soon as I got this new PC and it works really well. Restarts quickly. Chrome browser opens quickly. Can handle demanding tasks like Adobe Photoshop and Premiere Pro CC with little or no delay.
2505,The computer touchpad is terrible. very sensitive and it goes all over the place. The audio jack already stopped working. Always have issuing with WI-FI connections. None of my other computers have that concern. The quality is not worth it.
2506,"I purchased this laptop on Jun 13th and it was delivered on Jun 15th, which is the day warranty should start. HP sent a mail asking for feedback mail, in which it recognizes the purchase date to be around Jun 15th. However, when we check the warranty date, it starts on Nov 25th, 2021 (and ends warranty support Dec 29th, 2022)"
2507,Purchased this laptop in November 2021.  It is still under warranty but the HP website lists repair sites of UbreakIfit it. None of these sites would repair connectivity issues under the warranty.  Spent three hours online with HP support tech and still unable to access the internet.  We've always been satisfied with HP devices - no longer! The Amazon support CS did NOT offer to help provide a three way call to HP to fix the issue just gave us the HP 800 number. Sorry we purchased this laptop thru Amazon.
2508,"I never write reviews. Ever. But I am so disappointed after having this laptop for 4 months, the wifi stopped working. Nothing even shows up for connections. The touchpad/mouse is also not great to use, it is very touchy and ends up doing really strange things."
2509,"I only used it a couple of days when I got up one morning and it wouldn't pick up any wifi networks.  I tried to find out why, but there was nothing showing as to why it wouldn't find any networks.  So I had to once again break out my old, outdated laptop."
2510,I am waiting to see if Amazon / HP will honor the warranty.  My laptop developed vertical lines less than 3 months after i bought it.  Based on a test it was determinized that it was a hardware issue.  The laptop was not subject to abuse.  I am a 62 year old granny that keeps my laptop in my home.  I do not carry my laptop around.
2511,"I thought we were getting a nice, basic, laptop for my senior mother. It was nice for a few weeks then started having issues and eventually the option for wifi completely disappeared. After 10+ hours troubleshooting with windows and it’s still not fixed and conveniently out of the return period. I don’t recommend this device. It is flimsy- which is a little expected considering price. Also not a touch screen. Overall I would not recommend this laptop."
2512,"Just about 7 weeks after its April 29th delivery, this computer booted up to a different interface and we could not get the system back to its normal function despite the many options shown on the screen including selecting the option to do a fresh install of windows, system restore, etc. I am now left with a fancy shell of an inoperable device."
2513,Thought this to be an ok mid- priced unit. Liked it at first. Then it kept dropping off line. The dreaded blue screen shot of rebooting. This happened about every 5-10 minutes.  Two other computers in my house do not do that. Internet is fine. Sent it back as defective. They deducted $91.47 as a restocking fee. FOUND THAT TO BE EXCESSIVE. Do not buy this unit. Purchased a new one at Best Buy and it works perfectly.
2514,I’ve had this laptop for less than 24 hours and there is no Wi-Fi capacity only VPN or Ethernet! In 2022 that is totally unacceptable! Don’t waste your time or your money. I spent over an hour on the phone with HP only to have the representative hang up on me when she wasn’t able to identify the issue. Thankfully Amazon will refund my money but in the meantime I will have to go buy a working PC that actually has Wi-Fi capability.
2515,"This laptop is probably just fine for someone else, but I returned it for a full refund due to the lack of facial recognition software and a keyboard without backlighting.  Facial recognition is a great way to unlock a laptop, and can also be used in place of a password for many websites.  My condo is usually dimly lit and a keyboard that lights up makes a huge difference.  It was a mistake to order this laptop."
2516,If you hold it by the base near the touch pad the space bar will press without clicking it which can be annoying especially watching videos. Other than that it's pretty good
2517,"The computer was good looking and pretty responsive.  The screen had a sharp image. But that's as far as I got.  I had the computer running a total of about 1 1/2 hours when it put up a blue screen and froze! Will I get another HP? I'd like to think this is ""one-in-a-million"" but I do get dubious."
2518,"I'm a casual home user.  This unit is awful.  I don't know the verbiage, but I've had nothing but problems since my purchase 2+ months ago.  I still have my old HP PC which still works, it's at least 10 yrs old.  I'm done w HP."
2519,Purchased brand new. Inexplicably turns off by itself while on a full charge and plugged in. There's also a fun bug in Windows 11 that turns off the wifi by itself and won't let you turn it back unless you do a full power-down (I've run all Windows updates). Restarting the computer doesn't fix the issue. Pretty bummed out that I've only had this a few months and it's a complete lemon. Not sure I've had such a frustrating experience with a piece of technology before.
2520,"Wifi function routinely disappears. The fix is spending hours on the phone with hp while they completely wipe the laptop and reinstall everything.  Really handy.  👌  AND since there's no ethernet port, it's basically the most worthless laptop available."
2521,"Barely two weeks after having received the laptop, the wifi drivers are barely working. The laptop consistently acts as though wifi does not exist and I am constantly forced to restart the laptop just to get it to recognize local wifi connections."
2522,"I bought this laptop a week ago was excited to try it out. Set it up and then one day later it wouldn't identify the WiFi. I tried network reset , reset adapter but nothing worked.  Had to send it back. Don't buy this one. There is some problem with the WiFi adapter."
2523,"This product met my expectations. I use it to run software for my Laser Engraver.  i bought an external Docking device that allows me to have more USB ports, and an Ethernet port as well as a few more."
2524,This was a great computer until it started losing internet every time I booted it up. I have to call HP support every day and have them troubleshoot things to get it working. I’ve begged for them to replace it but they always think they can fix it. I’m so annoyed and just want to throw this thing out the window
2525,The computer does not recognize Wi-Fi so you can’t go online at all. Hp had me reset some things that were supposed to fix the problem but ever time I try to get online this happens again. Obviously the computer is defective. Trying to reach someone at HP but no luck. Don’t waste your money!  This is a scam and I will be reporting this!!!
2526,"Do not buy!  Within a month of purchasing, the wireless adapter just suddenly stopped working and disappeared.  Upon further reading of the reviews of this computer, apparently this is a common problem. So save yourself the frustration and avoid buying this. I'm giving Amazon high marks for giving me the option to return it for a full refund without hassle."
2527,"Item is listed as new and shipped from Amazon. The unit I received came with the standard laptop box packed in a much larger box with NO additional packing to protect it. It had a ""second life"" used/refurbished sticker affixed to it. I looked up the serial number on HP's website and sure enough a warranty had already been registered for it 3 months ago."
2528,"Ever since I received this, it has been ridden with bugs. At least twice per week I have to reinstall the BIOS because it has lost connection with its network adaptor and has no ability to connect to the internet without an ethernet cable (for which it has no port). If I were not in Kenya, I would return this machine. Very frustrating to have to start my workday with a 20-minute BIOS reinstall."
2529,"This laptop is very responsive, very fast. i have read other ratings saying that it is flimsy, I find it sturdy. The only problem with it is the keyboard, without full light over it you can barely read it and it is not backlit, the letters are etched over silver keys, very hard to read them. I had to buy a desk top lamp to use the laptop. Other wise, a very good laptop."
2530,"This laptop worked for just under a month, and then the wireless card gave out. All of my devices, including my 4 year old HP Envy laptop are connecting just fine to my network. I've restarted, run diagnostics, and still nothing. It continues to say there are no networks available, which means that the wireless card isn't working, at all. It's not even finding other local networks let alone mine. Since this thing doesn't have an Ethernet cable port, it's useless now since I can't connect to the internet with it. Returned."
2531,WiFi adapter is dead. Return window went out just over a month ago. Literally had this stupid thing for 5 months and now it’s useless. Only used for writing papers in word and uploading for school assignments. Avoid HP like the plague.
2532,"Never had so many issues with a laptop before. Contacted HP numerous times and instead of acknowledging the laptop has an issue, they kept trying to restart it, reflash the OS, etc. with weeks of back and forth as it would work for a few days before disappearing again. worst part is after all of this time and no lasting solution, the return option on Amazon is gone, and HP is saying thats how we have to get it replaced. I would have expected better from HP... Do not recommend at all."
2533,I got this as one of the Treasure Truck deals and was excited to use it. I've had it for 7 days and didn't even use it every day. I opened it tonight and there was no internet connection! Upon investigation there was no wifi device detected. I'm so upset. I opened reviews here and saw a long review that covered this same problem in detail. I immediately initiated the return and requested a refund. It worked fine until I did the Windows update and then the wifi disappeared like it never existed. >:-(
2534,"I thought it was a good deal for the amount of horse power this computer has, so I bought two of them. within the first few weeks both laptops’ network cards failed, and they're unable to connect to wifi. So we've had to use usb wifi dongles. Would not recommend this product."
2535,"WIFI adapter stopped working just over 3 months of having this laptop. HP said since this is software issue, (and software warranty is just 3 months and hardware warranty is 1 year), I can pay ~$50 for them to help me fix this issue (for the first month)."
2536,I have bought this laptop for my business associate. As he was traveling he didn't have a chance to set it up. we were trying to do now but neither wifi nor bluetooth are responding. Amazon told me 30 days passed and dismissed me. Truly bad experience.
2537,"Bought in January for a work from home job that I needed a decent laptop for.  Works well with Teams, video quality is ok, but I'm not using it for gaming.  Only 1 HMDI port- which is kind of annoying when you'd like to connect it to multiple monitors. Another annoyance is that it will sometimes disconnect from home WiFi- which is inconvenient (to put it mildly) when you need to be online for work. Other than that it's an inexpensive machine that for the most part does what it's supposed to."
2538,"After initial setup, the machine stopped being able to connect to the internet. Wifi wasn’t even an option anywhere to be found in settings or anywhere. I got a replacement and the same thing happened to the replacement. Nothing was clicked, the awful driver was no where to be found. I do not recommend."
2539,"I bought this for my wife, who teaches English at a small university in Zimbabwe. She LOVES it!! She doesn't game with it, so doesn't need a super-fast computer. She loves the solid feel and the quick reactions. So far it does everything she needs to do with it."
2540,"Technically the laptop itself meets my needs, but the resident programming sucks. I do not like nor use McAfee, and having their annoying popups every few seconds makes me hate it."
2541,"Have to reboot because the shift key doesn’t work, have to reset your modem every time you turn it on to get wifi. Eventually it stopped connecting to wifi all together 1 one passed the return date. Piece of junk"
2542,"Slowest computer I have ever had. Only purchased to use adobe and editing software as I have a chromebook that does everything else but does not support adobe software. I have had HP in the past and hoped for a better experience since the last time I purchased an HP was in 2011 for college, however…. All other features are fine. Just, very slow loading 😵‍💫"
2543,"i love the SSD and the I5.  not too crazy about windows 11.  Their passion for one drive and how they removed functionality from standard utilities like photos.exe.  But, I love the computer, especially the boot time (<10 seconds)"
2544,"I bought this computer at the end of April and have used it maybe 10 times and I ALWAYS have an issue with being able to log in, keeps kicking me out, now the battery won't charge and won't work unless it's plugged in. To make matters worse I tried to install the updates to see if that would help the battery and now it won't let me sign in at all. Keeps looping back to the sign on screen. Don't waste your money!"
2545,The laptop has been doing this the second week I got it. It loses the capability to connect to Wi-Fi and then tells you to connect to Ethernet. Which I can’t because it doesn’t have an Ethernet port. So every time we have to reset the laptop to factory settings in order for it to work
2546,"The laptop is a standard laptop, no extras which is what I needed. Two weeks into owning the laptop, the WiFi completely disappeared off it and all the computer was detecting was a LAN. I factory reset the computer and all was fine for two more weeks, when I woke up and did it again. Had to send back the computer for a full refund, luckily I was still in the window for returning it."
2547,My only complaint with this 15.6 inch HP laptop is that the letters and numbers on the keyboard are very difficult to read. I had to buy a keyboard cover with black letters and numbers so I could read the keys.
2548,"This laptop has everything I need without paying a high price.  Nice to look at, super thin and light weight, and was easy to set up, and it came with Windows 11!"
2549,"Worked fine for few months and then started loosing internet connection requiring to connect repeatedly.. but now, it won’t connect to internet at all. Tried to get support on chat but wasn’t helpful .. tried resetting etc including factory reset and nothing works."
2550,"Not too happy with the device.  Overall performs weaker than my last computer at the same price point (also HP) with less features (touch screen, can turn into a tablet by folding).  I would personally return this if I didnt get it online and had to deal with shipping back and forth."
2551,"The laptop has to be shut off and restarted.  NO USING the RESTART function either.  I have to shut it down, wait a bit, then start it for the WIFI to reappear.  All work is lost!  And, you can not add anything to the task bar!  All the sites I frequently use, can not be dragged & added.  WTH?  I have had this laptop less then 24 hours and I absolutely HATE IT!"
2552,"The shift key for @ sign for email comes out as "".  The shift "" comes out as @. Update.  Apparently I set the language as English UK instead of English USA.  Working fine now."
2553,So my first one broke. HP replaced it. Second one broke. My insurance replaced it. Third one is now broken. Do not buy this laptop. Same problem every time. The touch screen and volume stop working then the screen just goes black. THREE TIMES IN A ROW!!
2554,"I like HP products and this computer is not an exception.  My earlier, older, slower, and heavier laptop died between Zoom meetings.  So it was research time and get an order placed, was I ever surprised when two days later I had a new laptop and was set up and handling everything like before.  Working great with Chrome where many of my files were stored."
2555,"After 2, 3 days trading with amazon.com, it's symbol showed up on the 1st app web page.  I realized that this is built with an advanced AI system.  Amazon has been collecting data concerning my buying habit for many years, and it suggesting this and that beforehand.  But it will never be like human, because human mind is many hued animal."
2556,"Would have given 5 stars but it keeps disconnecting and losing the wireless adapter.  The first time it completely disappeared from the system and I had to reload it from the HP site.  It was a pain to get it reloaded and connected!  The second time, it disconnected from the wireless adapter but it was still on the system.  I restarted and it reconnected. It's a significant inconvenience to not have wireless capabilities on a laptop!"
2557,"The screen is bright and easy to view, however, the keypad is difficult to view unless you have light right on top of the computer.  The keys are labeled in silver with the overall keyboard also in silver.  I had to call in a professional I.T. person to set-up the computer.  Windows 11 created major problems for him and took him hours of research to solve the problems (especially with the HP printer) and he has been working with computers for over 20 years!"
2558,"This is my first laptop and my first PC in at least a decade so there's a learning process. I'm using it to start working at home. My only issue is I wish the keyboard had a backlight and I wish the letters, etc were darker or thicker etched on the keys."
2559,"I needed a cheap laptop to install Kali on. This fits the bill but I had to fight with it to turn off bitlocker, disable the TPM and jettison Windows 11."
2560,"Would have given 5 stars but it keeps disconnecting and losing the wireless adapter.  The first time it completely disappeared from the system and I had to reload it from the HP site.  It was a pain to get it reloaded and connected!  The second time, it disconnected from the wireless adapter but it was still on the system.  I restarted and it reconnected. It's a significant inconvenience to not have wireless capabilities on a laptop!"
2561,I did not like to be followed up with warnings that the drivers were dying so Microsoft had to update the computer which really ended up being scammers trying to wipe out our account.  The computer works perfectly.
2562,"I want to start by saying that I love the big screen and Microsoft office runs well on the computer, but for the life of me I cannot figure out why it is so fickle when it comes to wifi connectivity. Sometimes it connects to wifi with no problems, but other times it won't even register that there is wifi available let alone connect to it. It is incredibly frustrating and you probably need a computer that connects to the internet so I would not recommend this computer."
2563,"I got this laptop from the treasure truck. I have been wanting a new laptop so it was perfect timing. This laptop was really easy to get set up. I haven't had a bigger laptop in a long time but as a college student it's much better to have large screen and keyboard to do work. It's not a touch screen, which I really like. I might use it for video games at some point but that's not my main priority with this laptop."
2564,"I bought this laptop for university school and let me tell you...it could take jamming! Battery life is long lasting i must add and the graphics quality is exceptional. I have absolutely no issues with this laptop. In fact, i will be buying one for my son for his birthday! Definitely recommend."
2565,Bought it as a surprise for my grandaughter and she loves it.. She has always liked mine and has wanted one like it.. One of the best laptops I have ever owned..
2566,"I like the laptop it's fast it boots quickly, but as you can see from the photo it's almost impossible to read the keys which makes it almost unusable for me."
2567,"I thought I got a great deal as I purchased this through treasure truck. But like many of the other reviews stated, there is constantly issues with the WiFi. Every time I close the lid and the computer goes to sleep, the next time I boot it up, WiFi cannot be located. Long story short…..I returned the damn thing."
2568,I only use this laptop for school work. I bought a laptop last year that failed me after only a year of working. Will update if this computer does the same
2569,"I am still experimenting with this little girl, but I am very pleased. I do not game, so didn't enter a comment. Very smooth operation, speedy - I've not used this version of Windows, so taking my time to test drive newer applications. BUT, very pleased. Would recommend."
2570,Nice lightweight laptop with good speed and easy to use BUT big issue here is I Lost my WiFi connectivity after using it for only 2 months and had to purchase a TP a link to plug in to the USB port In order to get WiFi connectivity back - occasionally the connectivity will come back only to disappear again randomly so I have to keep the TP link plugged in all the time…. This is a huge problem for me as I needed this to work remotely when travelled and have to use WiFi- this needs to be addressed
2571,Wife uses this for work and has done well so far waited a little bit before review to see how it would be and has been great! Battery has been solid screen great and easy to use easy set up light weight and durable to an extent feels a little flimsy but it’s a slim laptop shipping was fast great product so far !!!
2572,I love the size. It has everything I wanted except a touch screen which isn't important now that my granddaughter is older. The speed is great and it has a 10 key which I hadn't noticed until I received it.
2573,"It's very good, the laptop works well, and it kept well, the only problem was the time taken to arrive, more than a month,  the problem not from the seller but the company that you send the order in my country. thanks amazon!"
2574,All around its a good laptop. Its fast and reliable. However... there is nearly zero gaming potential. This thing only has 0.13 go of vram so anything other than minecraft and games of similar simplicity are a no go. Though it can do Xbox gamepass no problem.  With all that said everything else is great.👍
2575,This is my 3rd HP laptop and my first windows 11 pc. I bought it to replace a 5 year old Windows 10 HP Stream that I have kept up to date. I will be using this mostly for web browsing and streaming video  and can truly say I'm amazed by just how much faster this is. Video and sound quality is excellent and web pages load instantly. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a new laptop for personal use.
2576,"I bought this for school to make digital art and animation. It works well for those purposes, but I've honestly spent most of my time with the laptop playing video games. Pretty much everything from like PS3/360 era and before can run at high settings fairly stably. I don't think it can even launch most newer triple A games, so I haven't even tried."
2577,Can't speak to battery life - haven't tried using it for long period on battery.  Great for casual internet and streaming use.  Bought mainly as it came pre--loaded with Windows 11.
2578,Bought this over a year ago and love it. Just bought a second one for my father and he’s happy too. Great price great machine and it’s lightning fast. I use it mostly for work so Microsoft a office products. Some tv streaming.
2579,"My laptop arrived quickly and in great condition!  I mostly use it for work, but have used it for some older games and it works well.  I do not think it is powerful enough for true gamers."
2580,"Excellent performance.  My only gripe is that the keys are hard to read for old folks like me.  That said, I bought it for my children to use, so might not be a problem."
2581,"I don't do a lot of gaming, but it's great for Microsoft 365, email and shopping.  The only issue I have is how light the words on the keyboard are.  Until I learned where the 'end' key was, for instance, I struggled to see it.  Still it's a great lightweight unit and I am very happy with it."
2582,"I was honestly scared to buy this pc just because of so many bad reviews. But I’m glad that I did because my pc arrived early, and in good quality, I’m in love. And yes it’s for gaming also because I played on it, and it performed well. If you’re thinking about getting this DO IT!!!!! Don’t listen to these people (most of them are trolls trying to make you not buy it)"
2583,"This is a great improvement over my ancient Dell D800. Because it runs Microsoft Windows as the operating system, the laptop requires about three minutes to start all of the basic services and processes before one can reasonably use it."
2584,"For what I need, this is perfect. I have Zoom meetings on it and the screen quality is great. Watching a video the resolution is 1080hd.  The camera quality is 720hd. Far and beyond better than my old laptop that died after many years of use.  Since it does not have a built-in CD/DVD player, it is very light weight. I just purchased an external drive which is quite inexpensive.  Glad I bought this."
2585,I've been with PCs since IBM first unveiled it in Chicago at the SHARE conference.  This is the fastest one I've ever owned.  I bought it to replace an old Toshiba used for music and audio books.  This notebook is too great to use for just that.  Can't say enough good things about it.
2586,"I stopped buying HP in 2008 after purchasing one of their top-of-the-line laptops and having nothing but trouble with it from day one.  With that I had to struggle with support several times over the course of the next three months before they agreed to take it back and replace it -- when the replacement arrived, I sold it on ebay and decided not to buy HP anymore."
2587,This isn't compatible with the pricey HP Thunderbolt G2 dock.  Not sure why a chromebook is but HP to HP won't.  Also I bought this Amazon used and the warranty was activated and only had 4 months left.  Product itself seems nice though.
2588,"This laptop was purchased to replace one purchased in 2013.  I was not unhappy with my 8+ year old machine, but disk access had slowed down with fragmentation, and the battery needed replacement.  The attraction of SSD and price made a device change the only rational choice."
2589,"it came with a user and a password and when i connected it to wifi it was locked by the user. After some struggle now the laptop is usable, support from amazon was great compared to hp where there was no support."
2590,Only 2 weeks into using it and all is good so far. I’ve had HP laptops in the past and have had good experiences. I think this will also be a good purchase.
2591,I'm still learning how to use the features.  As far as I know it does not have a touch screen.  It has issues connecting to the internet/wi-fi after updating.  It does not have a place to connect an ethernet cable which I should have checked before buying. It allows me to do what I need to do so far.
2592,"I've only had this laptop a couple of days, but I really like it. I replaced an Acer and the construction of this unit if far superior. The Acer had only two small hinges for the screen about an inch wide. This HP has a continues hinge almost the entire length of the case. The hinge mounts broke off the Acer causing me to buy a completely new laptop. Just keep this in mind when purchasing a laptop."
2593,"I want to say is this is not a touch screen, which is so disappointing i absolutely cannot get used the touch pad. I have tried to no avail. I didn't realize it was touch pad or i would kept looking  its terrible .missed my return window Although everything else is good ,just really not able to use it"
2594,"everything worked just great. was delivered to my us imaginary address, then forwarded by our logistics company outside the us, arrived safe and sound. works so far so good-knock knock."
2595,"Only reason I ordered this one above other similar ones was because of the 1080p screen. I had no idea 1080p quality could be so lacking. IF you can handle a blurry/fuzzy display, this one is for you."
2596,We purchased this for my dad for Christmas. It is his first ever laptop. It's great for browsing the internet and playing solitaire on. He absolutely loves it! I would highly recommend this laptop for a first timer that just wants to browse the internet or read online books. it's not built for gaming at all.
2597,Look at the photo. The lettering on the silver keyboard is so faint that you can't see the keys from many angles and in less than direct light! Who thought up this disaster?
2598,Constant reboots itself which is probably a couple fan or overheated cpu. Contacted extra warranty I purchased and told to go to place I purchased. Did that and was told to contact HP. Guess shame on me for buying from Amazon to begin with.
2599,"The review says to rate the touch screen, but there is not a touch screen.  I purchased 2 adapters - one for the Ethernet connection and one for the mouse.  Would have liked another USB port.  The keyboard has a good feel, but the shiny silver with the thin letters, is annoying for me.  Installation was fine once I got past all the questions that were asked.  Speed is very good.  Have installed several HP computers in the past.  Don't place this at the top."
2600,"All our programs are cloud hosted so we didn't need anything super powerful. This laptop is actually overkill for accessing our web based program and Microsoft 365 but we bought these for longevity over any i3. The i3 models just don't last as long and tend to get slow much sooner than this i5 model. Dozens purchased, no issues so far."
2601,"I was expecting something more mettalic heavy, but feels like a Asus talking about the body. Otherwise performance is good. Feels smooth and responsive. I've got the issue with the WiFi driver and Windows 11 but fixed looking and searching on the web. HP support didn't help me at all."
2602,"I had a heck of a time when using this because of the wifi dropping out or not initializing.  I believe that the ""bloatware"" was interfering with it.  I say this because I updated windows  several times to no avail.  It does work fine now. The swiching of the wifi driver to disable letting windows decide when to optimize battery usage DID NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM.  The battery does charge quickly but it does not last super long (may explain in part the quick charging).  I am now completely satisfied."
2603,"The computer looks and feels sleek. It’s a powerful unit. But it doesn’t matter at all when windows 11 has a fault that will endlessly disconnect the wireless network adapter inside the laptop itself. If you can afford something newer, or ever run windows 10 for the time being, I recommend that highly. I’m so pissed at this laptop, I’ve probably reset the network settings and restarted it 10,000 times in 3 months."
2604,"I have an HP at work - like everything about it. When it was time to replace my old computer I chose an HP for home use. Very happy with it so far.  I'm not a gamer. I use it for e-mail, internet , and tax preparation."
2605,"Nice laptop, works as expected. It forgets the internet easily, if you leave your location and come back- so keep your eye out for that. Other than that there is not much to complain about."
2606,"Sometimes when I write on social media, E-mails ect, if I use certain keys the curser jumps back causing me to have to reset it. Could be my fault. Otherwise I like it. My previous computer was very slow so I am impressed with the speed. I am happy with my purchase and I feel it was worth the money."
2607,"Was not happy with the quality of screen, viewing was not crisp and clear. I thought I could live without a back-lit keyboard, but it is impossible to see the keys clearly because the characters, letters, numbers are very thin and almost the same color as the keys....especially if you don't have 20/20 vision. I found this computer, for the money, only average compared to what I have owned before."
2608,"I thought I was purchasing a new gaming laptop.  I'm pretty sure it was refurbished and it is definitely NOT for gaming! It has many glitches, sometimes drops internet and now the camera refuses to work even though it is downloaded.  It is now more like  a beautiful paperweight than a working computer."
2609,"I actually swapped the laptop from Costco for this one. The screen is huge! The processing apeed is okay too. It's just that i'm not used to the positions of the keys on thr keyboard. The letters shift to the left because of the additional numbers on the right side. Other than that, it is very good quality laptop and I'm satisfied qith it."
2610,"Got this for my 17 year old son for school.  It works great, fast, picture is SUPER clear, speakers were awesome.  It was an excellent price for everything that comes in this laptop."
2611,"La marca hace muy buenos productos, funciona excelente, pero por la cantidad que termine pagando hubiera preferido comprar una de 15.6 Pugadas, ya que se me cobro dos veces la importación. una la cobra AMAZON al momento de la compra y tambien le pagas lo de la importación al servicio de paquetería FEDEX México al momento de la entrega."
2612,Bought this HP laptop as NEW not a refurbished or used one. Was very excited to use it considering it has 4.5 stars. Very disappointed. I have an 6 year old laptop that will run faster than this thing. It can’t even find any Wi-Fi networks and to finally get connected to one it takes a very long time to do so. The discovery mode for searching for any devices is absolutely terrible. This thing sucks
2613,"I bought this for my private practice and it works great. Does not have a bunch of bell and whistles but it meets my needs since this is what I leave at the office. Analogue:  Better than a flip phone or Google phone but it's not a new  iPhone. I am very happy with it. It runs faster than I expected, which was my biggest concern."
2614,"I am more than pleased with how easy it was transferring my files/photos, etc from my old laptop to this one. Being a senior, I am limited at times dealing with ""technology"" and since I keep all my records in a ""vault""  recovery of those files was critical for retaining my medical, financial, photo's, etc it was important not to lose them. My old laptop had zero memory available, but I was able to ""link"" the use of both laptops and transfer my files with little effort at all.  Very happy with this purchase"
2615,"crappy tin keypad, locks up alot. It's 1 of those laptops that you took the battery out to restart, only now you push every key with your palm to get it responding, has to be much better one for half the money out their"
2616,Overall a decent laptop for work mainly using web browser to complete my task. The battery never really held a charger longer than an hour and after three months it didn't hold a charge longer than 10 minutes. After five months the laptop won't work unless plugged in.
2617,"Laptop quality is pretty good. The IPS panel pairs well with windows 11. I would recommend going for the 16gb version as with all laptops. 8gb of memory is not enough for most takes in 2022. As I have pointed that out. This computer comes from HP with an insane amount of bloatware built in. The system will consume about 4gbs of memory just being turned on, and with the bios locked down. The average user will not be able to wipe the drive and freshly install windows."
2618,"Very fast and powerful machine but onboard wifi failed after only two weeks of operation. Very disappointing. Getting mentally prepared for the warranty repair hassles.  Update: decided buying a wifi dongle was a better option then wiping data, being without it for two weeks and having to set it up again."
2619,This HP laptop is a great choice for everyday use. The build quality is great with no issues. The screen is crisp and sharp with no dead spots. The keyboard feels good to use even after long sessions.
2620,"its light weight, and the keys are large and easy to press, comes with windows installed and its a fast booter and runs smooth, perfect and will do the job"
2621,The wifi settings disappeared and i thought i was crazy until i had my coworker look and she notice the wifi setting wasnt there either. This laptop was defective. I returned it the very next day.
2622,"Laptop did a system update that deleted the wifi drive. Tried many options, but cannot restore wifi. Tried to restore to factory settings, but now windows won’t even open. Did a google search an learned this is a popular problem many had with their laptops as well."
2623,Product failed. Hardware not working. Needed it to be ready to start grad school for my daughter this week. Would not recommend. Very disappointed. Now I have to return and buy another laptop for her first week of school.
2624,Computer has disconnected from the internet twice and says there is no connections available. The only way I have found to remedy this is to factory reset the laptop and start over.
2625,"The product didn't work right from the beginning.  It would kick off in the middle of an application and it would shut down wifi. Also, it was difficult to turn and off."
2626,This HP 15-inch Laptop is very bad product. It has wifi adapter compatibility problems. The wifi asapter is incompatible with windows 11 operating system & does not connect to the internet.
2627,"Quality was weak, flexible in areas it shouldn’t be. Mine had sound issues where if the laptop was tipped sound would go out and sound bad. Also if you pushed in the middle of the keyboard or by the speakers it would go out as well. Returned for refund."
2628,"Picked this up for my 85 year old dad.  Very fast machine, nice and light.  Trackpad clicking isnt as smooth as more expensive machines and keyboard feel is just ok.  Would totally get again if on sale."
2629,"If you read the negative reviews, you will see that this computer has problems. The Wi-Fi keeps dropping and you have to dig deep into the computer to restore it to only have it occur a day later. Also, the screen size is small and if you are older, it will be hard to read unless you bump the document size up. You should also know that if you do have the Wi-Fi problem with the computer and return it within the timeframe that Amazon sets, the seller will charge you a 20% restocking fee."
2630,This laptop repeatedly went offline and would ask to be connected to a ethernet cord. It did not have an ethernet outlet. I called HP several times and was told to expect this with Windows 11? I had to return the laptop because it was affecting my ability to work
2631,Bought in late Nov.  Set up for wifi to download updates.  Left it alone.  Picked it up the other day to do some additional work and it doesn’t even recognize that it has a Wifi card.
2632,"As soon as I plugged in this ""new"" laptop it popped up with the name Andres Garcia and asked for a PIN. There were also a bunch of old saved wifi addresses. This was definitely not a new, or even a professionally refurbished laptop. This was almost certainly stolen and resold. DO NOT BUY"
2633,"I purchased this as a gift for my wife. The description stated it was a touch screen, it's NOT. Beware before purchasing. That was a major selling point for me,  & I was disappointed with that. Cross reference info, model #'s, etc with other places before buying here."
2634,So far I love the laptop. It's bigger than I thought so I will definitely need a larger table for it. It's easy to use and connect. One of my favorite purchases.
2635,"HP never disappoints! This is a nice large laptop, good for home and school use, would like if it had a backlit keyboard but for the price, I can live with it."
2636,"Okay, so normally not a big believer in brand new, basic laptops. Like cars, I would prefer to buy a higher spec laptop that is a few years old for the same amount of money. However, when this came up on Prime Day as a flash sale for Prime members, I threw caution to the wind and recklessly spent my hard earned money on something that inflation had not yet seem to hit!"
2637,Disgusting that this computer sold on prime day was sold as new and had another person as administrator from the UK with all his info . Had to hire someone to work to get him off😡😡😡
2638,"Poor contrast with keyboard keys. Poor design by HP, I would say! Lots of people do not have excellent vision! White on black would have been much better, as shown on my hand held calculator. Getting accustomed to Windows 11 is another story, for a later time! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~"
2639,"For $299 a great buy. Even has Solid State drive. I rarely ever use my computer anymore. I forgot to update to win11 so instead of buying it, just buy new. My old Lenovo (2016) was very slow. I swear they program it to slow down after 5 years."
2640,Works fine but the casing is defective and already falling apart. Now the laptop cannot be closed. HP technical support offered to have it shipped back for repairs and said they would return it within 7 to 9 business days. Who can be without their laptop for 2 weeks?  My son can’t because he’s taking online colleges classes.  Beware of Amazon Lightning deals. You get what you pay for.
2641,"First, it's an HP.  I have come to trust HP for reliability and price.  It's a little slow for me because it only has 4GB of RAM, which I knew when I bought it so I'm not faulting them.  It has a SSD, which is only what I buy now.  Boot time is faster and things run faster for me with a SSD.  Screen is excellent in size and display."
2642,Its bulky and slow.  I am not a fan of windows 11.  There seems to be a lot of clicking with very little action.  This is a throw back.  I just need a machine to fill in.  I guess it will do that.
2643,I mainly use this computer for working at home and some internet browsing.  It is much faster than the laptop with an i5 processor and twice the ram than it replaced.  For general tasks that aren't too demanding it is a good affordable option.
2644,"Seems to work fine.  I like the big screen and the ample SSD storage.  Wish the keyboard was lit, otherwise, it's perfect. Thank you for a quality product and fast shipping."
2645,I like the size and the picture but windows 11 is hard to use big learning curve wish it was more like xp just basic is all i need just trying to put a app on the desk top screen is hard no drag and place
2646,"The laptop itself is fine. I bought it because I couldn't update my old laptop from Windows 7 to Windows 11. If I had known then what I know now I would've taken my chances on keeping Windows 7. Windows 11 is such an intrusive, cluttered, jump through the hoops mess that I hardly use the new laptop."
2647,I got this for using with my sewing machine. I’ve always used a mac but my sewing machine is only PC compatible. Im in a learning curve now. The PC. Is what I need
2648,Impossible to see the keyboard symbols. Dark grey on a light grey background.  Hard to open. Need to pry open with two hands. But overall a good value and machine.
2649,It was time for me to replace my old laptop that I had for years. It’s easy to overuse them and wear them out. I found that it’s also cheaper to just replace it. I always prefer Dell and HP products. This is my 3rd HP and I love it!
2650,"I have a Surface Pro as my workhorse, it's hard to beat for speed and screen resolution. I didn't need that for a second machine. This is the machine I use for browsing, social media, crafting (knitting/crochet patterns), writing, and watching videos. The larger screen works well for these tasks, and I can even have 2 items on the screen. It is rather large, so it is not easily transportable. I plan to primarily use it on a small desk in my home."
2651,The first thing I noticed when it was delivered is that the laptop is HUGE! I was disappointed because I thought it was a touch screen and I thought it would have lighted keys but it didn't have either! It has a great looking screen display but the speakers are weak and the battery doesn't last long at all. I wouldn't recommend this computer.
2652,"I was so excited when this laptop arrived today - it was delivered undamaged, it was updated already with Windows 11 & it was so easy to set up!  Thank you!!!"
2653,I’m going to need help with using the laptop. The new generation is good at figuring it out. I’m old school and don’t even know where to start. I’m going to need help I’m 68 and the new technology is not working out for me.
2654,"I did notike the fact that right in the middle of reading the news, a porn sight popped up and my computer was locked down so I am returning it asap!"
2655,I loved my previous Chromebook!  This thing always signs me out and then tells me my passwords are not valid.  Then it continues anyway and DELETES all of my files!!  It locks you out and even though you are putting in the correct password it tells you it isn't. You Go through all the hoops to reset password and it doesn't do that.  It either locks you out or deletes your stuff with no way in.  I am ready to throw this piece of crap out in the driveway and run it over!!
2656,"This product stays charged, but at random times, the screen will go blank and shuts down and will not turn back on.  This has been a problem to use because just when you need it, it might be inoperable.  I would be hesitant to order this Chromebook"
2657,"I got this Chromebook in Amazon Day @ a great price, in fact I am writing this review with it! i am IN LOVE wit this thing!!! the one I was looking for!!!! forget about Ipads or Tablets, this thing is AMAZING if you are in the market for a great laptop get this you will LOVE IT! 5  Big Stars from me!"
2658,Like a previous comment it would not cut on once plugged in there was nothing wrong with the charger cord because it charged my other HP just right. The laptop itself would not cut on or accept  the charger
2659,It’s painfully slow at loading things and it’s pretty much still at factory - nothing is on the computer yet. I have xfinity and really good internet strength so I know it’s not my internet as my other devices work great.
2660,"The edge of this laptop is sharp, and leaves either my palm or wrist with painful deep grooves. I can find no after market accessories to fix this. I can find lots of other complaints about the sharp edge on line though. My Acer Chromebook has just a slightly rounded edge and does not cause this problem."
2661,"It works, for the most part.  I had the problem of it going black if I didn't use it for 20+ minutes.  I would have to wait for it to decide to work again.  When it is working, it is great."
2662,Listen to the reviews… computer does not work. Tried purchasing a new charger just in case it was the charger but still does not work. Returning for refund. Save your time and money..
2663,I have purchased other laptops that cost more but for my needs they were not better just had more features I didn't need.This laptop for the price fits my needs at an excellent price.  Very satisfied.
2664,I always thought a Chromebook was just a different platform based on Android but for laptops. No. It is worse. There's no way to open a PDF except in a tiny window with an app designed for phones. Half of the apps I use on my phone won't work in Chromebook but there's no comparable app available. It is horrible.
2665,Awesome to finally get my own laptop. HP is a a great addition to any office for work or home. All my office machines are HP. Great product for a great price.
2666,"This computer is a great value. It is good for whatever your application. Whether you're a gamer, streaming enthusiast, movie junkie, designer, or accountant, this is the affordable option for you."
2667,"I was looking for a new laptop for my husband and a Chromebook was recommend by one of our daughters and a grandson.  My husband absolutely loves it!  Great quality and price, fast and easy operating with easy set up.  Very pleased with this purchase."
2668,"Not even a month and it died on me in the middle of working on an application.  It was fully charged. Still have time to return it but all of my documents are saved. Id, birth,etc... and once they open it they will have access to my email and everything.  Next time I will get a real laptop from a store with warranty.  I will have to just miss out on that 150.00"
2669,Many nice features and the battery last 14 hours. It doesn't have a touchscreen nor enough memory for big games like World of Warcraft but suits my purpose for school and business.
2670,Hmm comeing from being a MacOS & Windows User the chromOS side of things are blan…still does what a laptop does just this one hits different…i still recommend this laptop for any type of user😌
2671,Nice for what it cost. I particularly like the keyboard. The screen was the weak point. I felt like I was looking at 20 year old laptop. Unacceptable by todays standards. Charge $50 more and equip it better! I gave to a friend in need. For free it was awesome to him.
2672,Product looked like a refurbished version and the charging port was broken. Returned the item but haven't got my money back and the item was received over a week ago. Do not purchase this product.
2673,Worst thing I ever did.  Nothing now works on my regular desk windows 10 computer. It's all screwed up. I can't even get 9nto my email on my regular computer anymore . Chromebook has destroyed everything. I hate this laptop.
2674,"Screen quality is good and also the touch works well. So far, so good. I've been using it every day for work. All I need now, is the HP pen."
2675,"I like the screen and the weight. They keyboard is fragile, the space bar sticks. But by far the worst feature is the left mouse click which takes 3-5 tries to get a single click."
2676,"I'm so pleasantly surprised. This pavilion doesn't even remotely seem used. It looks and performs as if its brand new. I am SO happy with my purchase and glad I went for it. I have an HP from 2015, i3 processor, and it's starting to show it's age. I love HP and this doesn't disappoint. The swivel touch screen is sleek, thin, and easy to use. It's extremely fast. 10 out of 10 would buy from this seller again. :)"
2677,"I ordered the white but got the blue one instead. Looks like a kids toy, cheap. Make sure you have the time and resources to return the order if it s not what you asked for."
2678,"When laptop is asleep, majority of the time it will not awaken by key press, lid opening, nor power button. You must force a shutdown which you will lose data you are working on."
2679,"This was perfect for my 90 year old mother-in-law to use to review her emails and look up various web sites.  Easy for her to use.  Light weight and easy  to carry, if needed."
2680,"This laptop seems so outdated and tiny! When I say tiny, my toddler thought it was a toy laptop for her smh lol! How can you sell this for over 200$. I wish these sellers would lose their accounts for selling crap to people spending their hard earned money! Better off going to Best Buy or directly from the HP website! I’m so disappointed as this was a gift for my parents! Do not waste your money! Trust me!"
2681,"THIS DOES NOT COME WITH 64 GIGABYTES IT COMES WITH 57.4 AND IT FILLS UP YOUR STORAGE WITH APPS THEY GIVE YOU I DOWNLOADED 3 THINGS, THE SIMS CHROME AND ROBLOX AND MY STORAGE WAS FULL I ALSO DELETED MOST OF THE APPS THEY GAVE ME AND IT DIDNT HELP THE STORAGE AT ALL, NOT TO MENTION ITS SLOW AS HELL"
2682,"The laptop is Thin and looks like it would be a good processor. We are trying to recover our bookkeeping software online. And the older HP is full. I thought it would have been a quick solution. I was wrong. So I will return. We have moved up to all Apple products. However, we needed the disk drive to transfer the original laptop info to the new laptop to get it online for our clients."
2683,"do not buy, i had to return the first one bc the CTRL key was totally broken, then the replacement they sent the screen was darker on one side.  after 2 tries im done.  The computer is not worth $249.  Maybe if it was cheaper i would have tried a third time, but even then it only has 4GB and the screen is pretty small.  there are much better HP computers out there for the same price.  Dont buy it. keep looking."
2684,"I've had several technology fails this year, including my gaming laptop and my Linux laptop breaking down. My budget is not what it was when I bought the gaming laptop, and the other one was a hand-me-down from a relative. So, I needed a cheap laptop to do basic typing and web browsing on until I can afford something to game on. Finding a non-Chromebook under $300 is tough these days, so I took a chance on this model."
2685,"It is very nice looking, light and small. I bought this for my wife to use in college and she really likes it. It is a bit slower than I would have liked, but for the price and use, it's good."
2686,Garbage I missed my return window by A-day I want to return this so bad.  Every time I turn it on it takes forever and freezes half the time. I used it like 2x.  Not worth it
2687,"Bought this for me wife. I don't know if she's logged in on it yet. I use it on the couch, at church in the choir and for taking notes at meetings. Didn't review bang for the buck as I bought it with points"
2688,"There’s nothing fancy about this thing. I bought it to supplement my Mac products for work compatibility when needed. I don’t really use it to run apps or thirsty programming. It does Microsoft office, saves files, talks to the cloud, and connects to the web with wifi. It does everything I need and nothing I don’t. For the price, I’m happy, and if it’s stolen or breaks, I won’t lose sleep."
2689,"First off, don't buy this. I bought this for a job search. It's full of nonsense Microsoft sign ins and bloatware. You have to sign in and deal with extra stuff to use it. Completely user unfriendly and ridiculous and a pain to use.  Totally and completely not worth it. I regret buying this. Do not buy this. Learn from my mistakes and read the other negative reviews."
2690,This is the worst computer I have ever used. It gets stuck all the time and the screen hardly works sometimes. Normally I don’t leave a review but this computer was a disappointment.
2691,Small and compact. Perfect for when I need to work from home. Just what I was looking for and needed. Great price for a laptop. Arrived on the day I ordered.
2692,"It works great but the scree. Is so small it makes it hard to work on. You'll probably need a docking station or additional screen for it. However, it does tell you the size when you're purchasing"
2693,"Buy something, any something else because this laptop is crap!!! It didn't give me the option to give it a ZERO otherwise i definitely would  have!!! You get what you pay for and this was a waste of money 100%!!!!!!"
2694,"What I like about it is because it’s got iTunes, Disney+ and other cool features on it. What I dislike about it is because my mom named my C Drive incorrectly by spelling my name in a short way and with a lowercase letter at the start of it instead of doing it properly the correct way. It was another one of my birthday presents that I’ve bought for myself!"
2695,I liked this laptop because I was looking for something small but powerful to travel with. It is perfect and I like Windows11. The plus for me is it had an hdmi slot sling with a usb slot. Prefect for me. You have easily get it out of S mode to install the other programs you use.
2696,"I love how this laptop works, great running, adequate storage even for gaming and runs quick and easy with great battery life. The only problem I see is the screen is made out of a cheaper material and gets dirty easily even as a touchscreen. At some angles the screen looks darkened and seems to be higher gamma rate I believe"
2697,I love this little laptop so much! Bought it last minute when I found out my chromebook wouldn't work with my new school's online software. Wonderful decision I'm so glad I bought it! Holds a charge very well and is the perfect size
2698,"Super lightweight. The matte screen is ideal for viewing in bright light. In spite of the haters, this device is quick enough for complex PowerPoint with embedded video. The microSD slot is a real plus. I've added 128 Gbytes and can store everything I need. Full size HDMI port works great for presentations; too many tiny computers require an adapter. It's true I've only had it for a day but this is a dandy solution for travel and I'm a Mac guy. I already had a bluetooth mouse and I recommend such for efficiency; I don't like touchpads."
2699,"This is a terrific little laptop. I have owned several HPs over the past decade or so. This is lean, it has terrific visual capabilities (screen), and I can use all my Microsoft programs on it. Easy access to HP support (easier to use than ever), is greatly appreciated."
2700,"I am actually satisfied. I got it within 8 hours of purchasing and opened it the morning it arrived. It's my first laptop and I'm impressed with the buttons, the screen and the overall price for the item."
2701,When it works it is great but it sometimes doesn’t want to power up or when it goes dead it does not want to come back up until fully charged which takes hours. It is hit or miss on when it decides to work
2702,Its ok to use for simple things like browsing the internet but if you to play any games its not great. Its have barely and storage and when i tried deleting anything i could it didnt change much. Its runs fast for a small and cheap laptop though ill give that but its only good for internet usage briefly
2703,"Laptop is ok but I cannot get it to work with my Tripp Lite U442-DOCK7D-B docking station.  Ethernet, mouse, and keyboard work fine through the docking station but the laptop will not recognize my HDMI or DataPort connected monitors.  The docking station works fine for multiple displays with my HP Elite Book.  Very disappointing for a newer technology laptop."
2704,The screen quality is fair. Battery does not hold a charge for a long period of time. Very slow to boot up .’just not happy with the product. Returned to Amazon
2705,"I got this for personal use as I have a more expensive laptop for work. It does well for basic streaming, shopping, and word documents. It doesnt have the best webcam quality for zoom meetings but it works good enough"
2706,"The laptop was a bit smaller than I expected but I wasn't too worried about having a small laptop, it looked cute. The only problem is it can't load games very well. My little sister wanted to play Roblox on it but nothing would load into the game. I'd say the laptop is only good if you plan to do web browsing."
2707,"Good little netbook, kind of slow. Screen is good. Heavier than expected but still very compact and lightweight. Decent battery life. I am satisfied BUT that's probably because I got mine in the Amazon Warehouse for under $80 it was a super deal, if I had paid the retail asking price I'd have probably returned it. Good for checking email and lightweight tasks on the go, would not recommend as a primary laptop for anyone."
2708,Bought this strictly for my cameo 4 and thought it was bigger due to the pictures that were shown. It’s a nice little computer and does the job but it’s hard to see exactly what I’m doing unless I’m right at the screen and with my glasses on. The volume on it sucks too. Turn it all the way up and can still barely hear it. Haven’t tried n e gaming on it so only gave that a 1 star since I had to give something.
2709,"I was overall impressed by the quality of this laptop. The gaming performance was admirable for the specs, and it felt like a good build. However there are several obvious and some not so obvious tradeoffs."
2710,"This laptop is elevated by its rubber feet 2 cm off the ground.  This really allows more airflow to leave the laptop, which being an AMD system, gets hotter and uses active cooling more aggressively with performance.  While this is a laptop that should not be used for long periods of time without an A/C connection, one can actually game at full performance for 4 hours consistently with both fans going at maximum.  Thermal throttling takes quite a while (I could only get the 3050 Ti card to throttle after 1.5 hours of Doom Eternal at maximum settings)."
2711,"One of the best laptops at this price. 16 GB memory, a powerful CPU, and an okayish GPU with CUDA support. The only downside for me now is that the touchpad is not very good. I need a mouse to use this one."
2712,I spent several days migrating my apps and data from a dying Dell laptop (SSD failing) using a USB mouse (because it is easier to deal with for complex screen picks than a touchpad).  It was only then that I found that the touchpad was non-functional. Even when booted into BIOS the  touchpad diagnostics would not function. Thanks HP (NOT) for selling me a lemon. Works well otherwise.
2713,"This button-down dark gray HP laptop will spend the majority of its time doing algorithm driven stock index futures trading. For that task, it really has the Right Stuff; wired gigabit ethernet port, world beater office task performance, a bright, crisp 1K display, and the ability to drive a 4K external monitor to its full potential. Sometimes I'll bring this machine with me and the fact that its appearance has about a zero ""Star Wars coefficient"" is totally a plus. I like the keyboard, its nice white backlighting, and overall style and build of this machine."
2714,"Bought this for work to replace my MacBook and I love it. I have a custom built PC, so I don’t use it for gaming. But the Ryzen handles my workload and 10 hour work days like a beast. The only downside is the battery life isn’t the best as compared to competitors. The track pads feels cheap (just use a mouse) and the screen does wobble when hit. Still would recommend over most MacBooks."
2715,Perfect for gaming and the battery life has been great so far. This boots up and runs super fast. No lag for me when playing Xbox games. Definitely recommend this a PC if you love gaming.
2716,"A lot of gaming laptops are very flashy, with RGB lights or other gimmicks. This looks like a chunky but non-nonsense laptop but is also a decent entry-to-mid-level gaming machine."
2717,"Shifting from a gaming Asus ROG laptop to this has been surprisingly wonderful/all around positive experience.  Only upgrades I did were the installation of a 2TB nvme Samsung 970, and doubled the ram.  However I did these upgrades well after already performing the tasks below.  However the ram and storage has made editing 4k recordings with no delays.  I also was able to get those components on a very good sale which justified the impulse as it was a nice to have not a need to have upgrade."
2718,"I switched over to this HP Victus gaming laptop around two months ago. Based on the build quality (it's sleek and feels great to type on even though no mechanical keyboard), its performance when gaming (mostly MMOs or FPS games), and how it handles multitasking (I run a BlueIris VMS server on it most of the day with about 7 PoE cameras recording through it), I can comfortably recommend it."
2719,"The size was right for my lap. I was disappointed while gaming I couldn't press ""Start"" button to Google a question but needed to sign out of the game, then look up my question. The cords were constantly getting loose."
2720,"I'm not going to waste any time going through things like performance benchmarks here. I figure if you're looking for a gaming laptop, you've probably already researched that stuff. If you haven't, go ahead and do that now, I'll wait. Seriously, you should do that. It's important stuff. I'll be here when you get back. *Whistles a jaunty tune*"
2721,"The Victus line of laptops from HP is supposed to be for budget-conscience gamers who want a laptop that has decently powerful internals but forego some of the unnecessary things like RGB lighting and an elaborately designed case. I think that it mostly delivers on that idea, but this is still an $1100 machine and other brands like Lenovo are capable of delivering the same specs with a good screen and a little RGB (at least on the keyboard)."
2722,It is nice gaming laptop with nice configuration . Ryzen 7 5800H + 16GB RAM dual channel and NVIDIA 3050Ti is enough to play really good games . Value for this configuration I would say is exceptional.
2723,"Upon receiving the laptop I booted it up and within 2 minutes it froze. Thinking it was a fluke I rebooted the machine and it froze up again. I've managed to reinstall windows, update drivers and nothing. This thing freezes within 2 to 5 minutes of startup if you're lucky. sometimes i can't even get past the login screen. HP has offered little to no help for a machine that is essentially bricked out of the box."
2724,"This laptop is very sleek and elegant looking, as opposed to a lot of other gaming laptops which are too flashy to be used for work.  I appreciate that a lot."
2725,I just received it today and for someone who is hardcore “build your own” when it comes to computers I was extremely surprised with how powerful this laptop is right out of the box! The bloatware is nonexistent and as soon as you boot it up you’re met with a silky smooth windows 11. For anyone looking to play intense games like rust you will be amazed at how well it renders and plays!! Definitely on par with big desktop computers but with portability!! 10/10
2726,This laptop works but cannot handle photoshop and multiple monitors and the biggest issue PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU READ THIS: the 16GB of RAM cannot be upgraded. You are stuck with limited capacity because the motherboard cannot be upgraded past 16GB ram according to the HP documentation. It works and runs fine but if you want to do multitasking or streaming or real gaming this IS NOT THE LAPTOP for any of that. It should not be called a gaming laptop.
2727,"The Victus lineup consists of HP’s entry level gaming laptops.  There are currently two Victus models: the Victus 16 (released May 2021) and the Victus 15 (released June 2022).  The 15 and 16 in the model’s name is the screen size, in inches (rounded)."
2728,"It was so fast it made my head spin, great with gaming.I just love it 😊 The only thing I wish it had was the fingerprint sign in but overall very happy."
2729,Like the laptop but the trackpad came out to be defective and Amazon is not ready to replace this item for the lower price which I had bought during the Prime Deal. Hence giving it a 2 star for the worst customer service until now from Amazon
2730,I thought I would have to get an additional 8 GB of RAM but since I've received my Laptop and used it for the past week I realize I don't really need it.  I'm not a gamer or big on using apps that need a lot of RAM so I'm very happy with the performance so far.
2731,"I've had many Lenovo products over the year and have always been happy. Actually my current laptop is a Lenovo convertible and I love it, has no issues what so ever. This unit is very nice, well made with a great fit and finish. It is also quite thing and light weight. Comes with a charging box and plug. So far it seems to charge quite fast. It was dead when I took it out, but after a short time it said it was at 84%, surprisingly fast."
2732,"This IdeaPad 3i is very well made and runs far better than I expected. The screen is clear and sharp with no bad spots of dead pixels. As expected, there is some bleed out with solid blacks but that is a common thing with all screens like this one."
2733,"The IdeaPad 3i fits neatly in a category of computer I call the ""homework laptop."" It's an inexpensive, reliable machine that's well-suited for kids to use to get their homework done and watch YouTube, but it's not designed for people doing heavy multimedia work of gaming."
2734,"Really well built, great screen too.  Not exactly a powerhouse but pretty good for general use.  Pretty decent for a little portable workstation to take between the house, the kitchen, the garage, chilling in the yard, etc."
2735,Even when running the most basic of tasks Windows processes plus Lenovo apps are going to be consuming a lot of CPU and memory. The machine is powerful but the software installed is wasteful.
2736,"Excellent value for money laptop. It is an excellent device for productivity and entertainment of streaming services. If you are looking for a gaming laptop, you should look at other options."
2737,"Got this for my daughter who is a junior in college this fall. She had been using an iPad to do school work, but that does have some limitations. She is transferring to an out-of-state college and will have more demands from her class work than the iPad can hold up to."
2738,"This machine does exactly what I need it to do  - web browsing, simple word processing and email and video - both video chats on zoom and Teams and watching videos online and downloaded videos."
2739,"I wanted a backup Chromebook for convenience. This Lenovo Flex 5i caught my eye. Very good reviews and  good value,  now that the price has come down some. I am happy with this purchase and the Seller, for the shipping and receiving was also quicker than expected . Thank you"
2740,"This is the perfect Chromebook for a college student. It is lightweight, with a lighted keyboard to use during the dark. I got this to replace the other Chromebook I have used for five years and it is magnificent. It is not as light weight as described but the heaviness does add to its durability. So far, 10/10. I would reccomend it."
2741,"UPDATE: I took the panel off the bottom to have a look, and the 64gb storage is indeed a normal 42mm long m.2 ssd.  So it is removable and replaceable."
2742,"Size of screen is good for young students. Memory and storage also good for elementary grades. As this is the same brand that the student’s school is using, that makes it familiar  when doing homework ."
2743,"Quick and responsive Chromebook, replaced a $150 Acer 11"" Chromebook that was about 6 years old and now out of updates, OMG what a night and day difference, glad i made the purchase."
2744,"I have not purchased a computer for myself in many many years, as I was always provided one from work. When I retired, I needed my own.  I could not be any happier with my new chromebook!"
2745,"Make sure you sign in with a gmail account to use all of the devices features like the google play store. Only gripe I have is a low battery life. Other than that this is the perfect tool since all of my school courses use google as their main communication and office/suite programs. Also the perfect device to use leisurely watching Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, you name it. Plan to upgrade to an even better version one day!"
2746,"The first time I ordered this was from a different buyer.  What I received was a version with a celeron processer and 4 g of ram- not what I ordered.  I returned it and bought this one which is as I ordered it and now after some effort works as specified.  Now the problem:  Initially it wouldn't boot up.  With the given accurate directions, I downloaded the appropriate ChromeOS image, flashed it to a usb drive and installed it over the defective one.  Now it works fine!  Hopeful for the future!"
2747,"The laptop itself is perfect. I just didn’t think it was ever going to get delivered after being delayed for 2 weeks. Moving forward, I bought this for my son on prime day. It’s was super affordable and I still can’t believe the price was only $300. I will say I did see that the prices increased by a $110 that same day. They must have sold pretty damn good during the sale. Overall, my son loves it and he was so damn excited to finally get it in his hands. Again great buy."
2748,"Great laptop, has more than enough power to do everything web related and can play streaming services with out issues. So nice I just think can fold like a tablet or can go intent mode which makes viewing streaming services easy"
2749,"This thing is sweet. For my job as a traveling salesman this thing is perfect with battery, functionality, and weight.  Super dependable compared to my laptop ssd which would die in an hr.  This thing goes Iike 10 hrs and is never an issue.  Super reliable"
2750,Do not purchase the combination package with the pen... The pen is not compatible with this laptop. You will need a Lenovo USI pen. (Not sure why they are selling it together.) The computer itself is exactly what I wanted though.
2751,He loves the new computer the touch screen works great and computer is super light and convenient. Don’t bother buying touchscreen pen that goes with it. Ours never worked upon arrival and looks like most people have mentioned that. But the computer itself for the lost cost is awesome!
2752,"I got this Chromebook on a Lightning Deal and it is an incredibly good device for the price.  Good processor, 8Gig RAM.  Works great!  Plus, will get updated through 2029.  Easy and reliable."
2753,"It’s a chromebook not a laptop or tablet. They have no memory, but this has more. It’s best for classrooms or houses with wi-fi. My kid’s school requires them, but their “deal” on older models was about the same as this one which is twice as good."
2754,"This computer has changed my life, I was trying to write on my phone using the swipe keyboard and it was obnoxious.  Now I can much more easily express my thoughts and ideas, without all the typos, sore fingers and frustration."
2755,"Got this for my wife.  We are both very happy with it so far.  Nice screen,  metal chassis with ventilation slots.  Nice speakers,  spritely performance. Light up keyboard is nice.  Only complaint is that the cursor arrow is difficult to spot.  (Need to try some different background images.)  Highly and happily recommended."
2756,"Got the Chromebook and it was surprisingly fast and just works. Easy set up and great video streaming, better camera than my work laptop and easy to use and maintain."
2757,"Man, I really like this Chromebook. I've had this model for a couple years, gave one as a gift and the recipient loves it. It looks like Lenovo might be moving on from this model, that's too bad. It's a great buy if you get it on sale. A decent one at full price, especially if you get 8gb/128gb. Remember it's just a Chromebook, so there are a few limitations. Think of it as a bigger phone or tablet that's easier to type on. I also enjoy the transition on Andriod from Chromebook to phone."
2758,"I just received this chromebook, so I haven't had a chance to run through its paces, but I wanted to add some  information to clarify some of the questions I had about this purchase based on some of the contradictions in the description:"
2759,"I had always stayed away from chromebooks they seemed underpowered, 4 GB ram, slow what would be the point?  Well I saw this on sale and gave it a try first of all it's 8 GB ram and has an Intel chip touchscreen and light up keyboard. To quote goofy ""garsh""!  It isn't slowed down with all that windows baggage and works great.  I am pleased."
2760,"We love this Chromebook! It has 8 gb versus 4 like most Chromebooks. Top notch processing for my wife’s job as a remote speech pathologist. Great video/audio quality, easy keyboard and convenient touch screen. Lot’s of value here!"
2761,My daughter needed laptop for college this says its a laptop and tablet in one...not exactly true it is more like a tablet/chromebook in one but it works for what she needed it for...just no game playing since it wont download the game she wanted...seems like a nice device so far
2762,"Just got this Lenovo Flex 5i. It is a great deal (under three hundred since late July). My unit seems flawless so far. My only disappointment is the weak camera (640x480 snapshots), I expect better webcams these days."
2763,"My first foray into the netbook world, this Chromebook is fast and powerful enough for me to use for work and for general life.  (It's probably not good for gaming, but that's not why I bought it)."
2764,The i3 processor makes it fly with the 8 gigs of ram. The screen is sharp. wifi is good on this. I have a wifi 6 router. Battery life and standby time is solid. No problems with touchpad.
2765,"I've run investor-backed software companies for 30 years. This is the tease machine. When you use it for the 1st 3-6 months, it seems too good to be true. It is Not!!!"
2766,Speed on this latest i3 is a marked improvement over last gen... Speaker sound is much improved also... I have had two older models of this Lenovo Chromebook this is a big step up!
2767,"Purchased on July 22 , 2022, does not come with the hardware advertised. I received a grey color(not the abyss blue as the description states) and also received a model with the 5205u processor and 4 gb of RAM. Literally none of the specs the specs are correct."
2768,"Chrome OS very easy to use and intuitive. I use this for business and personal... It is perfect for both. I can access email, work on company websites, watch Netflix or Youtube and download almost any APP I could use on my phone! Highly recommend for anyone who just wants a useful computer to go anywhere with them."
2769,"Other reviews had the same experience but I foolishly hoped that the problem had been ironed out. Suspiciously, the Diagnostics app is missing from the Chromebook so it's very hard to tell what the hardware profile is."
2770,"Google Chrome OS and you will see that when, not if, the OS fails, you will have to spend an afternoon trying to recover it, only to end up with a big grey paperweight.  10/10 would scream at passing strangers not to buy one if I thought it would help."
2771,"We've become increasingly frustrated by the poor quality of the apps that we install in our smart TV, and so for most kinds of content we've taken to viewing it on a Chromebook and casting it to the TV if necessary. For the last couple of years, we've used a Google PixelBook, and it's been very satisfactory. But can we do better?"
2772,"This Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5i has an Intel Core i3 processor, very fast for a Chromebook, 8gb RAM, and a 13.3-inch touch screen. The set up was easy since I already have a Chrome account, took about 5 minutes. I made the mistake of accepting ""help"" from GoogleVox, an annoying voice that will drive you crazy. I disabled it ASAP. I recommend you skip the service when prompted."
2773,"You'll get an IdeaPad Flex 5 with 4 GB of RAM and only 64GB of internal storage. Which is a computer that should be $150 less. The product was labeled such to misrepresent it, didn't appear to be an accident."
2774,"Screen could be a little brighter for use in direct sunlight, but everything else about the Flex 5i Chromebook from Lenovo is killer for what you're paying.  Fast, responsive, awesome backlit keyboard, speakers are solid, 8GB of RAM, and the convertible form factor is very convenient.  It looks nice, too."
2775,I got this for my son who’s starting college. So far he loves it. He didn’t know it was a touch screen so that was a nice surprise for him. It’s perfect for his classes. It folds easily to make it more like a tablet. I did get the Lenovo pencil for it so he can write or draw on it as needed.
2776,"Two weeks after owning this chromebook the damn thing stopped working. Since it is under warranty, had to send it in for repairs. Still haven't gotten it back. They are estimating 4 to 5 weeks before they return it. I'm w/o a computer now. Have to do everything through my phone. Very unhappy with the quality of Lenovo..."
2777,Got this on treasure truck. 30 days later i was using it and screen went black. The 30 day return window expired and i was given contact number to Lenovo and they want me to either lay $80 for technician to come fix or $50 to mail it wait 15 business days. This is absurd! CHEAP DON'T BUY!
2778,This is NOT a laptop computer. It is a chrome book. Googles version of an iPad. Can’t be used with outlook or Microsoft work programs. Money down the drain. Misleading advertising!
2779,I used my chrome book 1 day and the screen went black and never came back on. Return was very easy and my account was credited very timely. I appreciate that. I think it might have been refurbished.
2780,"This was delivered yesterday. I unboxed it and plugged it in to find that the battery will not charge above 38% and it immediately powers off when unplugged. No biggy, this stuff happens.  I called lenovo customer service to trouble shoot and was told id get a call back in 24-48 hours between 8am and 8pm. An entire weekend gone waiting at home for a call to maybe come in at some pojnt. I will never buy another lenovo product again. Absolutely the worst CS."
2781,"La verdad aún no la sé usar bien. Ya que siempre he manejado laptop con otros sistemas operativos, aún no la he podido sincronizar con la impresora, pero es que la verdad Nose manejar el sistema Android, es cómoda a la hora de usar"
2782,Ordered this for my husband who needed a user friendly lap top right away. It came the very next day but won't turn on. We've had it plugged in for hours but it won't turn on.
2783,The chromebook I received has different components than advertised. The listing says 8gb of RAM and a core i3 processor. The device I received has 4gb of RAM and an intel celeron processor.
2784,"I shopped around and read tons of reviews, there are cheaper Chromebooks out there but this one seems stable I don't think the hinges will break its light enough to play games for a long time. Chrome is super fast I am so pleased with this"
2785,Though delivery took a long time and bad delivery experience the product is good. Works well as advertised but sometimes the sound gets muted after using for a long time. Hope its fixed in the next software update. Overall a nice laptop.
2786,"This little computer packs a lot of power, does more than I thought it could. I have always used a windows computer, but the Chromebook does all I need it to."
2787,"I bought this at half price on Prime Day so I could leave my pricey Apple MacBook Air M1 at home when I travel. After using a couple of weeks, this Lenovo 5i Chromebook does everything I need to manage my web site for one-fifth the price of my MacBook. Amazing. Very happy. Goodbye Mac!"
2788,Amazon says this is the 2022 model. It's not its the 2021. Has 11th gen CPU and no finger print reader. I'm returning it as it's not what I wanted.
2789,"Speakers sound good, clear display,you can replace 2242 nvme ssd yourself if 64GB emmc not enough which did little help some system response time but not a big difference.Bought at$429 and now price drop to $399 right now….."
2790,this was a warehouse item.  screen was a bit dingy in appearance.  colors and resolution lefy a bit to be desired.  decided to buy a different chromebook with a better display.  glad i returned this returned item.
2791,"I have seen some very nice premium Chromebooks. They always felt like they were too expensive for what you got. This Chromebook surprised me. It is not just well made--it actually offers powerful features all around, and it costs much less than the so-called ""premium"" Chromebooks."
2792,"I LOVE my new Lenovo Chromebook! It was easy to set up and start using. The touch screen works great. I haven't actually timed the battery, but it lasts several hours and recharges quickly. As for the camera, I haven't used it at all."
2793,"The chromebook arrived safely and initially operated fine.  Within a few hours the touchpad / cursor stopped working.  After a lot of research / power washing several times, the situation would be resolved and then re-occur.  Calling Lenovo stated that they would call back within several days.  I choose to cut my losses and return the chromebook."
2794,Update: scratch anything good I said about this laptop. im so sad within 3 months of use it’s completely broke unusable it won’t turn on it has a red light sometimes when it’s pretending to charge but it show no other signs of any power like it just died. Rip. Still no contact from the company. I do not recommend this company or laptop. I have no laptop and no money to get a new one.
2795,I love my laptop. It's small and compact and easy to carry. The screen is bright and clear.  I like the lighting under the keys and the AUE lasts until June 2029!!
2796,I was not sure I would like this inexpensive computer. I had bought tablet and hate it. Screen too small. The screen on this computer is adequate.  Faster than My old laptop.
2797,"I got a replacement and it's exactly what I wanted! Lightweight and the learning curve isn't so bad if you've never used a chromebook before, it only took me a few days to get used to it. It's very different from a normal computer and only good for light browsing and writing, I also got a large micro sd card for storage since it's barely got any, but I love it!"
2798,"This is my first Chromebook, and I've been using it for two days.  The battery life is amazing so far; it does appear to be 10 hours. Reading the reviews, it seems like a wide range of experiences, and I feel fortunate that mine works well so far."
2799,It is small and easy for my husband to manage. He just uses it to look on internet a few times a week and watch  and view movies and pictures
2800,"I bought this on prime day for a bargain! Needed to replace my 6 year old Chrome book that just doesn't stay charged anymore.  I didn't realize this was NOT a touchscreen and that sucks because I don't see well anymore, but for 100 bucks, why get anything else?"
2801,"I am one who will buy a product based on reviews and all of the reviews here were giving this chrome book such high praise, I figured it’d be worth a shot."
2802,I only got this for my son for school. He uses a program that signs in by QR code. Unfortunately I cannot get the camera to work what so ever. Everything else works but it kind of defeated the entire reason for my purchase
2803,"This Chromebook is dirt cheap and would be great for a student on a budget or someone who just needs to use a few apps and browse the internet.  I use it as a writing laptop, as I don't want to take my expensive, bulky gaming laptop all over the place."
2804,The package I g was ice. Laptop was beautiful but chrome books still aren’t compatible with a lot of software out there. I got mine for silhouette studios and basically had to turn around and send it back. That process was easy though so I can’t give it an accurate review but i can heed you to check compatibility if you need this product for a specific task.
2805,Bought as a back to school gift and can't even set it up. System needs recovery and is repairing itself on initial start up. Too late to return. Now what to do.
2806,"The chrome OS makes opening word files offline impossible. There is very little you can do on it without internet.  Making the laptop useless on planes, trains, or while taking notes. Thinking of putting documents on a USB to use offline? Forget it, can't open without internet. Want Microsoft office or excel? Nope. What's the point of buying it? There isn't one."
2807,"This device is useless after just under 3 months. It worked just fine through the return window of 1 month. After a little more than 2 months my son said it wasn’t charging. He used it sporadically until then, and now cannot use it at all. We’ve tried multiple outlets where other devices charge just fine. What a waste of money!! Maybe we received a dud, but I wouldn’t recommend buying this unless you want to take the risk of getting an expensive useless device as well."
2808,"Keep in mind: Budget-friendly option. We bought it over a Prime Day sale and we weren't expecting too much... Having that in consideration, it has been performing flawlessly so far! We use it primarily as the computer our children should use for school homework and research. Awesome battery life! The keyboard is also way above the average, especially with its price tag. The screen, though, is barely according to the price you are paying..."
2809,I guess it’s called a notebook. It works perfectly. I love how fast it is. I have the older model. It’s not the touch screen. It does not even matter. It’s just my new love. So glad I choose this one . It also fit my budget.
2810,This is a cheaply made product. After less than 1 month of use the letter keys started falling off. Thank GOD I still had my Samsung. Paying for security on that one because it ran out. Now I have to use my insurance to get my money back.  AND I lost money paying for insurance. But glad I did or I would be out of all money. Seriously? What happened to 1 year warrenty?
2811,"First, this is what it is. It's not a Mac, not a PC, but it is an 11.6 inch chromebook. As a chromebook. it's a terrific small chromebook. It's fast. in part due to very generous mammery. Small and light,with good battery life, it is truly portable. No touchscreen, but the price is really good for a unit this capable. A terrific value."
2812,When the school my daughter attends ran out of chrome books we were thrilled to see such a cost efficient and well running machine. It’s just what she needs as an eight year old for the classroom.
2813,"Day one, and the Ideapad 3 started right up. I'm going to let it charge for a while before I complete the setup. One star deducted for no English setup instructions in the box."
2814,"A very competent lightweight laptop. You can't beat it for the price. Does exactly what it says it will do and more. No touch screen, but a very responsive touch pad."
2815,"Purchased two of these on a prime day sale for $100 each and have been very happy with them. They're probably also worth their original $200 price tag, but at $100, it was an easy decision. Excellent battery life with around 10 hours when browsing, and it charges with an included usb-c charger, which is also nice as these chargers are becoming more and more commonplace."
2816,We bought this laptop for our five year old who plays roblox all the time. This laptop will not play roblox. You can not download or gain the play store. Returning.
2817,I bought two of these in July and it’s now October and one just completely Dirac and won’t turn back on. I JUST fully charged it and JUST had a zoom meeting on it five minutes prior to it crashing. Now the screen won’t come back on no matter what I do. What a waste of money!! I will never buy one of these again!
2818,"Anteriormente yo había tenido varias laptop con sistemas operativos Windows. Y una de mis mayores preocupaciones al comprar una nueva, era unir mi dispositivo móvil. Ya que me he estado manejando en la nube, y la Chromebook es mi solución. Fácil de usar y el sistema operativo es muy liviano. Yo le doy un 110%."
2819,Great little Chromebook.  I had an HP before. This one had some of plug-in features I like.  A good battery rating is important to me.  I use these for quick videos so I was disappointed at the quality of the internal mic- it’s very ‘metallic’ sounding.  I guess I’ll have to get an external mic.  So far this is my only disappointment- but it’s a big one for me.
2820,"The keyboard keys stick ! We have had the laptop for less than 45 days. They will not stand behind their product. Their comment, sorry you missed the 30 day return policy."
2821,"I wasn’t sure if it would work for me but I’m very happy. It’s like an iPad with a USB hub, a keyboard, and you don’t worry at all if the dog or the kiddo knock it. Very pleased!"
2822,"This was to be used for college, needed something quick, easy and inexpensive while laptop was being fixed. Found not use for college courses as the programs did not work with the courses software.  Had to send back and purchase a regular pc."
2823,"If a Chromebook and Chrome OS is for you, this version of it was flawless and feather light. It operates smooth, runs multiple apps fast, and has modern ports and connection capabilities for productivity and adaptability. Highly recommend for general computing."
2824,"This is exactly what I needed to take back and forth to classes!  It is super small but large enough to get my work done.  I can take notes in class with it and work on assignments and upload to my cloud!  It's quick, doesn't get real hot, the battery life is amazing and it is very easy to use.  I wish it had a touch screen but that's all it really lacks - so I am very happy to have gotten the offer on the treasure truck!  Great price for a great little chromebook!!!"
2825,Bought chrome book as temporary replacement for my old 2013 laptop and it works beautifully!  I can access most sites that I need to and I am loving my chrome book so far!
2826,"It is a Chromebook.  It is similar to a thousand other Chromebook models.  I suppose that is a good thing.  It does what it should do. If you have ever used a Chromebook, then you knwo what you get with this."
2827,"This is a good option for those looking to get a Chromebook. It is lightweight and compact, making it easy for transport. The screen is smaller (thus the compact size). I like the way it looks, and it has the feel of a quality laptop."
2828,We wanted to try this brand. It has been maybe 2 weeks of use and it died. NO more Lenovo for us. It looked like a plastic toy out of the box and I should have known better. It was always glitching and keep trying to update also for over 3 days. We have excellent internet. Will be Returning.
2829,It’s a good product the only thing is since it’s chromeos it’s a lot of things that you can’t download that you could normally download on a PC. I also wish it was touchscreen. But besides that it’s a really good product.
2830,"The Lenovo A/C charge adapter STOPPED working. I went to charge my Lenovo Chromebook and noticed my Chromebook is no longer charging using the charging adapter that came with the Lenovo Chromebook..  Bought March 4, 2022 and here we are July 4th and it is no longer charging.. Not sure what the issue is however I am not a very happy customer.."
2831,"I mean you get what you pay for. Functionally it's adequate but just barely. Pretty low on RAM, no touch screen, it's tiny, no disk drive, sound quality isn't the greatest either"
2832,I am a first time college student and I wanted something super affordable and I didn’t really care for the size. It is pretty tiny but I don’t mind and it’s light weight. The only thing is I’m a big confused on the touch screen part ? I was trying to use the touch screen but it didn’t work ? So far it’s nice and turned on just fine. I’ll update in a few months to see if it starts being funky but for now I am very happy with it.
2833,this is NOT a touch screen  which is odd since when reading the description it said it was. but i honestly dont care I am loving this. I am learning this new laptop but loving it for what i need it for. I got this from the Treasure Truck
2834,wish I purchased this instead of the Jumper Tech laptop I bought from Amazon. The chromebook was less expensive and actually functions. DO NOT BUY anything from Jumper Tech it is a horrible product. Amazon should not sell such garbage.
2835,"After Megan SNAPPED HER LAPTOP IN HALF, I needed to replace it. The only option to her watching videos on YouTube was me having to talk to her. I’m avoiding that for as long as possible. Teenagers are difficult to be around. They annoy me and talk about things I don’t care about. So, I bought her a cheap chrome book. Now, she watches videos and eats 4 times a day, and I can watch Law and Order, like God intended."
2836,"Oh, this little Chromebook is so much fun, it loads everything I did on everything, yes, everyone. If you have any sense in your Dome, you might like this little laptop they call Chrome. I highly recommend it. God bless. Thank you for reading my review I hope it is beneficial for you. May the rest of your life be the best in your life.  OZ"
2837,"Chromebooks answer the question, ""What if I had a cheap device that cannot do quite as much as my phone, with a keyboard and a larger, but not nearly as clear, screen?"""
2838,"If you can get past the poor screen quality, this is an decent, budget device that might be an acceptable option for a child or as a second device, or a device that you just want to have around for very light use (checking and responding to emails). It starts up fast and functions well. The keyboard is not great but certainly not bad either."
2839,"My 11 year old LOVES his chromebook!!!! It was exactly as described and I couldn't be happier! Yes, I said ""I"". lol He is busy now on his chromebook and out of my hair. He plays all his favorite games on it AND He is able to do his homework on it as well."
2840,"am i really typing this on a laptop/chromebook that cost $100? No lag, does everything i need, cheaper than a night out and i can email multiple files like a normal person now.  It’s amazing how smooth a computer can run on 4gb of RAM when there is zero junk programs already installed. Awesome buy! NO ANOYING PROGRAMS BUILT IN!"
2841,This was a gift and the recipient loved it! Battery life was much longer than expected. Hopefully will last a few years. Would buy a refurbished again since the price was so good.
2842,I bought this to use with a piece of equipment I use for my business. This works perfectly and I don't have to connect the equipment to each computer in our office when each of us needs to use it. Now we can use it with this laptop and transfer the data over easily with a thumb drive.
2843,I have been impressed with this Chromebook.  I currently own an iMac and a high-end Windows laptop that I use for software development.  I needed something for vacation travel and quickly looking up things on the internet or checking email.  This fits that need perfectly.
2844,The Lenovo Ideapad 3 11 Chromebook is a decent deal when found on sale or when purchased with the expectation of using it for entertainment and/or day to day tasks. It especially excels for a younger student needing mobile access to their homework/schoolwork while still fulfilling entertainment needs through the use of another profile (chromebooks are easily shared which makes this great for a family as well due to Chrome profiles).
2845,"I got these for my kids to homeschool on. For the price I was worried, but they are really nice. My wife had already spent twice as much on some garbage brand called geek plus that I suspect were refurbished dead laptops."
2846,I’m just using it for work to log in when I’m on the go to replace a larger laptop that I have so far it’s perfect to throw in a backpack and just go
2847,Got this laptop for my son's Birthday! This is his first laptop and he LOVES it! Very easy to use for him since it is nearly the same one issued to him during the school year. Would definitely buy again!
2848,"I’ve had this piece of junk for less than 6 months and the battery won’t hold a charge. I charge it to 100% and then turn it off. When I turn it on the next day, the battery is down to less than 50%. I wish I could give this zero stars. I bought this from the Treasure Truck and I paid more for it 5 months ago than it costs now. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of Lenovo and their junk."
2849,"My hard drive on my desktop PC took a dump and I will need to reinstall the OS but have a lot of stuff saved on the drive so I needed something to jump online at home to pay bills and stuff like that.  I didn't want to use my phone to be doing bills/ordering online so figured I would get this just for simple browsing and I'm happy with my purchase.  Battery life is great but then again I'm not on it everyday/all day but when I need it, I just open the lid and it's on and working."
2850,La computadora funciona bastante bien. Me sorprendió el rendimiento que tiene para el procesador y la RAM y mueve bastante bien las aplicaciones de Android aunque las desactivé dado que no las necesito.
2851,The Lenovo little Chromebook is great when working. However it gave three times starting issues. Today it asked me a recovery usb which I do not have it. I am going to dispose it and Amazon is going to refund me.
2852,I expected better… since I received it I have only used it three days… just not as easy to use as my iPad…. If I had to do it all over I would search for a  better laptop
2853,"Best ChromeBook this price range. Keyboard is very comfortable, and overall made materials are very good. As well it's supports latest ChromeOS and can run Android Apps. Thanks to Alice for courteous service. She really helped me to make correct choice."
2854,The laptop is awful - it has to be restarted dozens of times daily because the mouse stops working.  Sometimes it needs to be restated many times within minutes- it is super annoying ....
2855,"This would be a great little laptop, if it wasn't in Google's ecosystem. The whole Chrome system won't allow you to do things like install a Firefox browser so that you can actually be secure. It has very few settings, for example you can't have the computer remain on and close the lid. It's okay for what it is, but I wouldn't buy another one"
2856,I like it overall. The print on the screen is to small. The print in setup guide is way to small. I couldn't figure out how to register. Couldn't find serial number.
2857,Great for sitting in my recliner browsing Amazon. It doesn’t weigh much and it has tremendous battery life. I’m familiar with the Linux operating system. Controls are quick and responsive. Boots up in seconds.
2858,"Bought this on July 5, 2022 for my daughter to use for school. It worked fine for that until it didn't. It is now 8/6/2022 and it won't turn on. The charger works in other devices but this computer is now a paper weight."
2859,"As a emergency dispatcher I live this laptop does everything I  need and more. Powers on in literally seconds when time is not on our side. Perfect for researching info and anything pertinent we may need to find out about a place like call history, background checks, gps on our units and so much more."
2860,"Bought for my nine yr old homeschooler and he loves it, battery life is better than expected. This gives up the freedom to be mobile while learning because it's so light and easy to transport."
2861,"GREAT , small, and lightweight, very quick charge and does not run down quickly.  Had to have serviced within 6 weeks of purchase as kept shutting down on me and finally would not boot. Had to have serviced by repairman and battery needed to be taken out of inside and reinserted.  Luckily he did not charge an arm and a leg to do this for me, however it should not have had issues this soon--Love it as long as it continues to work!  Crossing fingers, has worked great this full week thus far since having serviced (fingers crossed)"
2862,"Second Chromebook I’ve bought in the past two months, they both display the error that Chrome OS is missing or damaged. My old one at least lasted a few weeks, this one only made it a day. Don’t waste your money on these."
2863,My kids do most of their school stuff using Google Classroom and a few other Chrome based apps and needed something I wasn't afraid would get damaged or lost. The price of these was acceptable for a consumable device required for school.
2864,"I really like this chrome book.  Very light weight. Very easy to set up. It automatically synced with my older one and transferred all my bookmarks over, along with most passwords."
2865,"I wanted a small, light, inexpensive Chrome Book for vacation travel for those times I didn't want to squint at my tiny phone screen.  I was very pleased with this Lenovo IdeaPad 3 11 Chromebook met my needs very well.  I was thrilled at the open box new, bargain price of $131 from ChiefComputers.  It was completely as advertised: no scratches or any a sign of use.  I was very pleased with this vendor."
2866,Easy to set up and even has a child setup option which is perfect because this was purchased for my 6 year old to do iready school app. Luv it. Gift somebody one because they are so affordable.
2867,Screen quality is great! Touch pad is very touchy... The slightest touch makes it work. I needed a laptop for basic things so this does the trick! Only had it since Xmas so quite possible I'll review again.
2868,"This item didn't turn on, nor did it charge. We followed the instructions and it never turned on. To top this, we didn't get money credited back to our bank account we only got a ""Amazon"" credit! This was a gift for our son's birthday. We want our money back in our BANK account to buy a computer,  NOT from this company or Amazon."
2869,I replaced a 5 year old Chromebook with this one and was really surprised by how quick this new generation of Chromebook is compared to a 5 year old version.
2870,I bought this for my son who is in the 7th grade for class work and it works like a charm! Screen is clear and bright and the CPU is fast enough for seem less streaking!
2871,"Got this in preparation for going back to campus in the spring--simple to use for taking notes, working on papers between classes, and so on. Battery life is closer to 6.5hrs on a full charge (not 10), which is disappointing considering my Acer Chromebook that got me through 4 years of classes easily lasted 9-10hrs on a charge. This will definitely serve the purpose I need it for though!"
2872,This notebook failed after 3 weeks. I was using it and the unit powered down and would not power on. I tried powering on with the power cable and without the power cable. It wouldn't power on.
2873,"Wouldn’t download and install an app from Google Play. Using this app was one of the primary reasons I bought it. This was a deal-killer for me. I can’t understand why an app listed in Google Play won’t work on a brand new fully updated Chromebook. I’m no expert, but I’m not a novice either, so I tried the work-arounds, for about 2-3 hours, and finally gave up. Sending back."
2874,"This Chromebook is so good! I personally can't stand the mouse pad as it doesn't have left or right clicking and it's a little hard to scroll, but I got a wireless mouse and haven't had any issues!"
2875,"I really need a laptop that is portable and faster than the one I was currently using. This one is more than capable of doing the job. Thank you, Alice helped me."
2876,I still can't use the blasted thing after contacting technical support on multiple occasions to ask them why my auto connection disappeared and I can't access the internet now. Can't access the internet the device is unusable. I will never order electronics from Amazon again as a result of this.
2877,"I was shocked at how snappy and decent this little Chromebook is. For the price you really can't beat it. My Father's Acer R-13 stopped working so I ordered this one for him. It setup immediately and even recognized his USB dock which allowed him to connect wireless mouse, keyboard and speakers. This is a great deal. I'll update if he runs into any issues with it in the future, but so far it's a 5 star winner."
2878,"I am very happy with this product. It is good for OS updates through to 2027, and does everything I can ask fro from a Chromebook.  Great price for a great product"
2879,"I'm actually writing this review on this laptop now to let everyone know that it was a good purchase! I'm normally pretty skeptical about cheaper laptops because some are so wonky and don't work, but this one has worked really well since I got it a couple of months ago. I don't have any complaints so far. Everything loads fast, the battery life is pretty solid and it's super simple to operate. I'd definitely recommend and even buy one again if this ever gave out. Which hopefully won't happen for a long long time."
2880,"Even though Lenovo is a well rated product, I was disappointed with the fact that there were messages- (506 total) dating all the way to 2015! I couldn't sign out of gmail and navigation was not easy. The seller should have stated how old this Chromebook was!  I did like the size, but overall it was not something I was going to keep.  Poorly rated by the seller."
2881,This computer don't look like the pic I thought it was a big regular touch screen computer it's not its a school computer for school kids my child has the same exact school computer and it does not download any type of games at all just paper work only or school work nothing else
2882,"This Chromebook is perfect for a person who wants a small, portable Chromebook. It works great and the price makes it 100% worth it. The screen size is big enough but not bulky and it seems fast and reliable."
2883,"Purchased on Cyber Monday for $149. Light weight and solid build quality.  It is used primarily for online exercise classes. No HDMI but you can purchase a usb c to hdmi adapter for several dollars. Works well for how we use it.  If you never used a chromebook, it is a different OS than windows..can make your life a bit easier by brushing on the commonly used cimmands."
2884,Charged this all night and hit the on button and nothing. This is making plenty of noise like it wants to turn on but display but never gets past that point. Ughhhhhhh
2885,"I ordered this for my daughters homeschooling and google chrome is not updated enough to run her classes. I am not able to update it. She still wants to keep it, but I don’t think it’s worth it"
2886,"I purchased this chromebook for my daughter for school. All of a sudden while she was in class working on a project, the computer shutdown. She assumed that it died so she plugged it up, still nothing. I have researched this chromebook and this is a common issue."
2887,The screen is horrible to see hard to control I need a touch screen didn’t realize it wasn’t. I am sorry I bought  my bad luck. You need to say not touch screen.
2888,"Despite the false advertising about this expensive little hobbit netbook, it has no touchscreen and does not fold... Its 200$, the screen is 11 inches lol, this trackpad is awful and of course its just a chromebook, but still  with 200 bucks your half way to building a brand new desktop pc that can play real games and has a a keyboard not made for 9 year olds."
2889,Its a great little pc that is perfect to check email and surf the internet. It is nice to use on your lap and is very easy to setup. I definitely would recommend for the above mentioned tasks.
2890,This has to be the worst computer ever. It restarts by it self at least once a day. The other times during the day it just freezes and you have to restart the computer manually. This occurs 3 or 4 times a day sometimes more. Just a waste.
2891,I ordered this chromebook under the impression that  I would be able to adjust the screen and that it was touch screen however is it not touchscreen and and the screen does not adjust it only opens and closes. Its more like a netbook which is basically a mini laptop. The best feature about this particular device is the google software which really isnt much when you have other devices. Will update later with pics.
2892,"A very lite version of a laptop, the battery last forever, the speed is incredible and the response is amazing. Of course this is not a laptop so you wont have a lot of programs, but still if you're looking for something simple and fast this is the best option."
2893,I have two teenagers in online school. These laptops were perfect for what we needed! Set them both up in minutes and had both boys doing homework. The only issue they have found is there is no caps lock and you can’t “right click” on stuff. So I would recommend a mouse and learning some shortcuts.
2894,"I have a reasonably powerful Window based desktop. I don't need a fast laptop when I travel; I just need something that I can use to transfer image files and view them if I want to. And I don't want to spend much on something that I use only a few times in a year. Most inexpensive laptops are really low power but still more than I want to pay. I had used them before and my experience was not so good. So, I started looking at Chromebook."
2895,"1. It takes a real effort to pull it open - it feels like a magnet keeps it locked in place plus it is hard to grab the lid in closed position to begin with. Because of that, I have to keep it slightly ajar instead of closing completely when I am done."
2896,Dead after about 1 year of light use. Charging port no longer chargers. Tried several chargers it's not the power supply it's the internals of the chromebook. I've built and fixed my own computers for over a decade but it's not even worth my time to take it apart and trouble shoot it/repair. It was supposed to be a throw away laptop and I guess I got what I paid for... now I get to throw it away.
2897,"I got this cheap Chromebook for the purpose of streaming video to my Chromecast, since the old laptop I was using for that purpose was on its last legs. For that purpose, it works well. Signal is sufficient, connection is easy. Battery life is amazing. But I don't think it'd be much use to me for anything else. The screen, as others have noted, is small and not particularly sharp and the keyboard is too small for my big hands. Can't imagine using it for my main machine, but it works for what I got it for."
2898,It is horrible logging into this thing I have to type my password in 12 times before it recognizes it. I set it up to where I can have a local password and every time it wants me to connect to my Google account and tells me my password is wrong every time.  I have to keep changing my password every time I want to login. This is ridiculous. I wish I could give a better review but I can never log into the thing.
2899,Only positive reviews on My new laptop/computer at such a low cost.  Perfect for seniors like me and those.  with simple projects.  My new computer came securely boxed and. the. Beautiful Wrapping found only in top rated big box stores.  This computer was. Such an  unbelievable surprise. Buy. for yourself and have the surprise also.
2900,"This Chromebook would have been great, but it wouldn't recognize my WiFi nor my time zone. So if you live in Eastern Standard Time, you might want to get another unit."
2901,Great for everyday use for email and internet. Light weight and easy to travel with. One annoying thing is the letter y button does not work and I have to depress it about 3 times before the letter shows up.
2902,This chrome book is wonderful.  Feels so good as I was looking for a smaller computer to use while sitting and watching TV.  But this is more than I expected and for the price I paid was a bargain.  Wht a good buy I got.
2903,"This is a durrible little chromebook and it works well. It has great battery life, the sound quality is good and it gets my kids homework done. I love it."
2904,"This Chromebook is advertised as being Lenovo 82BA0003US, which has an Intel processor and 64 GB of storage.  Instead I got a Lenovo 82H40000US, which has an AMD A6 processor and only 32 GB of storage."
2905,I think the laptop will work fine. BUT.. There was no charger included with this product. I have to clarify this review. There was no charger included in the laptop that was shipped to me.
2906,"I never got a chance to get fully into setting it up for what I needed it for, and it just stopped working!! It will not power on!! And because I didn’t open it for use till literally past a month after getting it, I’m past the return date.. SUPER UPSET!!! 🤦🏽‍♀️"
2907,"It made it seem like it had a touch screen, IT DOES NOT. For the price, it's fine. Fast with the 4G of RAM but the storage is small and there is no touch screen. Wouldn't recommend and wouldn't have got it it wasn't on sale for basically $100"
2908,"If you are used to a small screen or that's what you like, this Chromebook should be fine for you.  I just couldn't get used to how small everything on the screen was, and when you increased the size everything had to be scrolled to the right to view the entire page.  I understand this is normal for smaller laptops, but I returned it and bought something that was near the same size as the laptop I wanted to replace and am much happier with it than I was with this smaller one."
2909,I am so ashamed of myself for purchasing this product. I knew better but I thought I might be getting a good deal. Computer will not load….anything. It doesn’t work and it never did. Amazon is not a good place to buy a computer.
2910,"My 5yr old uses it for online class. works great, there is a camera and we can scan the written work using this device and upload - works for me. All of what she used at her age is web based anyway so I was happy and did not want to buy anything too expensive. weight is good that she can carry on her own. recommend some sort of protective case still."
2911,I am a stay at home mom as well as an online student and I needed a new laptop that wasn't going to break the bank. This is perfect I paid around 170 after taxes and shipping and it is everything that i need to do my school work and then some. The size is perfect where I can put it in my sons diaperbag. Battery life is amazing and last a lot longer than my lenovo flex.
2912,"This was purchased for my wife and she loves it! Much lighter than her old one and runs cooler. She uses an old school mouse so with no touchscreen, we saved big buying this model. Overall, very pleased."
2913,"Here's the thing, I could not comete setup to save my life. I ordered this as well as a separate Lenovo Chromebook, but could not access wifi to setup this device. In Guest mode there was no issue but that defeats the purpose of being able to sign in and start using our accounts. My wifi was restarted, reset, adjusted, tested other networks not even close to home with similar results. So out of the box it could not complete set up."
2914,"I guess it depends on your needs. The screen resolution is pretty bad in my opinion, also, there is no caps lock key on the keyboard, you have to press shift every time you want to cap something. A lot of the apps are not available for download. I will not be returning because I only needed for personal use, but if you're a student or need it for work I would definitely look for something else, especially if you are going to be watching videos or movies!"
2915,"I should have read the description more closely. This laptop has no touch screen. Despite the name, ideapad, it is nothing like a pad. The screen does not detach like an IPad. It is nothing more than a basic laptop."
2916,"The screen stopped working, no damage just stopped working so I had it replaced. They sent me a new one (after 2 weeks without a laptop). Now the replacement screen has broken from me picking it up by the screen. I understand that this is one of the cheaper options but if you need a separate screen for it to work you may as well just get a mini desktop."
2917,"Opening the box which was clearly labelled as Surface Pro 8, not only the Surface Pro 8 keyboard did not fit the laptop nor the dxdiag system was not Surface Pro 8. I belive that the laptop is Surface Pro 7 and was shipped as surface Pro 8"
2918,"The item I received was substantially unlike what is being portrayed on Amazon. The unit was described as 1TB storage, 32GB RAM. I received 500GB storage, 16GB RAM, and the unit was clearly marked as refurbished despite not saying that anywhere on the site."
2919,"Easy to break, impossible to get fixed.  Microsoft made these things extremely hard to repair, even if its something small like one of the small prongs inside the charging port and I cant find anyone to repair it."
2920,"I saw a handful of reviews saying that this was actually a Surface Pro 7 instead of an 8, but thankfully it was indeed a Surface Pro 8; new and as listed."
2921,Bought  From ARF tec 32gig ram 1tb HD. Delivered what I ordered on time. I am verry pleased with the speed and quality of this laptop/tablet. I will update review if any thing changes. Customer service excelent.
2922,"Love having a tablet/laptop that has an OS that I can code on, run docker desktop, etc.....  I have had for a week and everything is awesome about it except for the battery life and the price tag and needing to buy the keyboard and pen separate."
2923,"Beware Microsoft calls this a PRO system BUT that does not mean Windows 11 PRO operating system. Also, this unit requires a new keyboard. I am sure the lawyers went through the dialog and found it legal albeit cleverly deceptive. AVOID"
2924,A surface pro 7 that was labeled to look like a surface pro 8 is what I received. Check the model number on the tablet as soon as you receive it!
2925,I like the fact that the Surface device serves a dual purpose of a tablet and a Laptop. The speed of my Surface device and its interaction with other devices is great.
2926,"I was originally skeptical, as many reviews mention they got a Surface Pro 7 instead of the 8 they ordered. I'm happy to say I received the Surface Pro 8 as advertised, new and in box. Shipping took one day!"
2927,"Too many glitches, very inconvenient.  Had to do system restore 3 times in a two month timeframe to get the system working with basic applications for school.  customer service is not very helpful either.  Best option is to buy directly from Microsoft."
2928,"Some of the reviews concerned me about refurbished models or not Surface Pro 8 devices.  I read the comments after I purchased.  One person noted, not in an original MS box. The Amazon rules, you can return if not opened. If it was in a plain box, or I felt it was not what I ordered then I would have not opened and returned to Amazon."
2929,"My only real gripe is the battery life, about 4-6 hours when using conservatively and 2-3 hours with settings turned all the way up (and I'm not a gamer. This was not a deal breaker for me though, it's otherwise a very powerful machine. A bit heavier than expected too, but this translates as durability/quality of product for me. Awesome tabluter, love it."
2930,My copy was great until it started to overheat then it would freeze & not responds to anything. The screen is beautiful though but look at Dell as an option with more inards values.
2931,"So far I am loving the computer, the only problem I have is, it doesn't have a regular connection to USB, it seems like Microsoft are trying to copy Apple and make you buy specific things for their products which is something I do not like at all. Other than that it’s really lightweight  and a good combination between a tablet and a computer , pretty awesome"
2932,"Honestly my company used Surfaces for a while and I moved us to laptops. The processor in the surface is garbage. The warranty is garbage and these are throw away devices. Repairs costs are insane. These are tablets not laptops, do not let Microsoft fool you. If you need lots of processing power you wont find it here."
2933,"This is my third Surface Pro, the others were fine (although my first no longer holds a charge and must be plugged into the mains to work) but this SP8 is a paperweight. Constantly get blue screen of death and have to reboot."
2934,I am looking for a light weight device but same should have little bit powerful techinal specs. I looked for other brands mostly prefer Asus but I dont thing that there is other device to compare it.
2935,"I finally replaced my OLD Surface with this Surface Pro8 and I am very glad I did.  Smooth running, easy to use, simple to transfer from my previous one.  Why did I wait so long?  Well, maybe I should have waited for Prime Days!  Oh well!"
2936,"I bought this because I was running out of resources on my old Surface Pro 6, so I bought this maxed-out Surface Pro 8. It is better in every way except one: it's missing the micro SSD slot. Not i bought a cheap ""ducking station"" that adds that feature back, so that's mostly not a concern for me. A little pricey, but I was willing to pay the price to get what I need. And this is what I need. Two thumbs up."
2937,Frustrating someone from loss prevention you definitely have a problem at your fulfillment center.  I am seeing that there are other people that ordered the pro 8 got a lesser model with the same bogus sticker.  The fact that reviews are not going through is making me wonder about your integrity.
2938,"Please don't buy this tablet. I bought it last month and it is practically not usable. Constant windows blue screen crashes pretty much every time I turn it on. Even in idle mode, the OS just crashes. I wish I hadn't purchased it."
2939,"Got the Surface as early holiday gift.  Light weight, great screen and very fast with top of line processor and 16 gigs of RAM!  Keyboard and mouse just work right out of the box, wifi setup was a snap and it is so easy to move around.  Just fold up keyboard, put in backpack and it travels as well as I do!  Apple should have done this with the IPad 5 years ago!"
2940,"So I’ve actually worked with surface pros at work before but I’ve never bought myself a laptop/tablet over $300. I’ll be using this to do IT work remotely, homework and business. I was actually using the specs here to compare to the specs on less legitimate websites selling cheap surface pros. Why I didn’t use the Microsoft website idk it was late I was excited to buy a real laptop. My biggest worry was the i7 processor, screen and storage. I got the laptop in 6days. I checked the serial number through Microsoft to verify. Everything checks out so far."
2941,If you’re computer illiterate this is perfect for you. But if you need do use a specific photo editing software and you need to save it to a specific place good luck because it wants you to do it their way the machine itself is great. This version of windows is even worse than the last I may have to just stay with my 10-year-old laptop to get my work done
2942,"Bought this and used very few times over three months, basically just got it set up. After three months would not turn on. Amazon offered no help and/or 80% refund. Microsoft sent a new power cord which did not fix the problem and then offered to send a refurbished (used) replacement. Unacceptable for a brand new device. Neither resolution was acceptable to me. I advise against buying a Microsoft device and/or buying a device through Amazon. There are better options."
2943,"I bought it under 1k during prime day and this core i7 surface is the exact thing I was looking for! Perfect for productivity and also perfect for couch internet browsing. However, I found the original keyboard and pen extremely expensive, specially if you buy your surface on sale. So, I will consider third party options instead (Brydge and Reinasser to be specific)"
2944,The Microsoft premium price you will pay for this laptop is not worth it. Here are the recommendations for what to do when your Hello MS Facial Recognition fails after six weeks:
2945,"Twice the 2 units failed in the same; the battery doesn't last 4 and a half hours out of the box. I did everything to make it last at least 6 hours, but nothing changed the fact that for some weird or not the reason these 2 units suffer from the same. Now, I must let you know that these 2 units were brand new, sealed in the original box, with no fingerprint, and everything was clean and sealed."
2946,It was time to replace my old surface pro 3 which I bought new several years ago since it became very slow (only 8 GB of ram) and hot while the battery slowed to only 1 hour duration. I was torn between purchasing the Dell XPS 13 (which was about $300 cheaper) or the Surface Pro 8. I chose the Surface since I preferred the tablet functionality while retaining the option of a keyboard which is removeable (sold separately). I find it convenient to sit in my recliner with the tablet to read a book online.
2947,"This was an upgrade from a surface pro 4.  The build is way better quality, the screen is beautiful, battery life is great, and performance is (as expected) a new league of awesome.  My only gripe is moving the button placement. I accidentally hit the power and volume in tablet mode often."
2948,"On the third day, the display started to flicker.  Badly.  I performed a Windows 11 Reset and the display continues to flicker.  Hardware defect.  Attempted to return for replacement and Amazon will not replace, had to settle for a refund."
2949,Very bad design on charging port. Have had mine since February 2022 have since purchased 5 chargers. When you can't use it because your new charger hasn't arrived yet it doesn't serve a purpose.
2950,"The Microsoft whiteboard feature has deleted various artworks of mine and they are never coming back, the running speed is crap and takes minutes to load a single page, and stutters whenever I type, I’ve only been using it for a couple weeks now and I realized I messed up when I bought this product. DO NOT RECOMMEND"
2951,"When I ordered this surface pro, I was really worried that I will receive an open or different model as I have seen many reviews complaining about this. Lucky for me, I got a new and original surface pro 8. Setup was easy, screen was great. But battery life is definitely not what Microsoft has claimed being 16 hours. I cannot even get pass 5 hours. The battery life was the key reason I got this. And now I am disappointed."
2952,I got a surface pro but no charger.  It also does not seem new got it in a random box not a microsoft box.  This is definitely a refurbished piece.
2953,"If your looking for a basic laptop for home / personal use, this is a great buy. Don't spend hundreds of dollars. Purchase this chrome book and you'll be very happy. I am!!!"
2954,"I love my chromebook ,I am sad that I did not purchase an extended warranty. I feel that it is needed just in case of issues that may arise. We are enjoying it presently... Thank you!!!"
2955,"Bought 2 to replace 2 15"" Acer Chromebooks, they were 5 years old and Google will not Update OS.  We both use ours with an exterior monitor and keyboard/mouse.  These Samsung are simply perfect.  So simple to setup.  No negatives at all - al positives."
2956,"This is my second Chromebook. The automatic transfer of apps, bookmarks was flawless. I view this product as disposable, since updates have a relatively limited time span. I miss the touchscreen feature on my first Chromebook, but this unit was 1/2 the price. I can deal with a couple of extra keystroke combinations for that much savings. The speaker sound isn't the best, but a bluetooth speaker takes care of that. Battery life seems good so far. Keyboard has a solid feel to it, equivalent to my laptop."
2957,"It's not going to win any benchmarking races, but this little thing is great if you need something that will access the web in a snappy fashion. I was even surprised it had Bluetooth so I paired my speaker and use it as a music streamer. Really strong battery life even while using. Highly Recommend buying the used one; if you told me it was brand new I would have believed you."
2958,"I should have read closer B4 ordering.  I can't use it for doing my taxes, can't play June's Journey.  Couldn't load my McAfee Antivirus/ Internet security suite.  Pretty much good only for browsing.  Hate the keyboard and navigation buttons.  Pretty much a waste of $."
2959,"I bought this to replace my original Samsung chrome book. They are very similar. The transition from my old to new was very effortless. The biggest difference is the battery life. This computer does not hold the same battery life as my old one. I can charge this computer for the whole night and use it 6-8 hours. My old computer could go 12-24 hours. Also, this is not a touch screen. I prefer this style."
2960,"This was a nice little Chromebook with a nice price, however I bought this to use at a university for classes and it would not let me sign into any account that was not strictly @gmail.com domain. It would not let me download anything either, I had to download and save into my google drive specifically and it took me about ten minutes just to figure out how to add a wallpaper background onto it and I was never able to get into the university account."
2961,"The screen is dull, and there is not touchscreen. It's been 3 days since the device was received by them, and still no acknowledgement that they are processing a credit."
2962,I bought 2 Chromebooks 1 for myself and another for my Brother who needed a basic internet tool. This Samsung was recommended to me by a friend with the singular caveat that the screen wasn't the best.
2963,"The Google Chrome system has taken over everything including my non Google Email Accounts. It is the most controlling system ever. My old chrome books license ran out and I should have bought a Lap top with a Microsoft Operating System... this thing is the most intrusive, restrictive, limiting device I ever owned and it is the Google operating system that makes it useless."
2964,For the money $137.00 on sale its great. Its my 2nd Samsung Chromebook i loved my first one so much decided to get another. My old one is 5 yrs old so it cannot get updates. My toshiba computers i was lucky if they lasted a few yrs before the hard drive went. My 5 yr old Samsung chromebook is still going but it was time for a new one! I cannot believe any negative reviews for this chromebook. Esp at 44% off the reg. price
2965,"Was willing to give it a try . Needed a cheap laptop just do some occasional things :type stuff/ games.  Its great for searching the web , and checking email  . Its hot trash for doing anything else.an old dell latitude would be more useful.  Cant do anything unless you have internet.you have to do a lengthy back route install through linux. Cool on paper ""flexible, lightweight, essential "" : you get "" wack , limited,  tethered, a goofy phone"". --- first impression after 4 hours"
2966,"This Samsung beauty arrived quickly and in perfect shape.  Keyboard quite comfortable to work.  Nice size laptop, light weight. Can't beat the price and software updates till June 2027.  Everything transferred over from my previous Chromebook to this one. Can't beat it.  Logged on first time and everything was there.  Printer was even ready to use.  Very impressed.  I think the screen quality is just fine for my needs.  Excellent price."
2967,"The computer itself is good for what I wanted it for, but it isn't compatible with my HP Laserjet printer, which is very frustrating. So if I can't find someone to try and figure out how to sync my computer to my printer, I have to spend money on a new printer :/"
2968,I bought this to replace a Dell that had cost a lot more but was old...no battery life.  I like it a lot better and the battery lasts a long time. I have arthritis and it is easier on my hands too.
2969,Like the size and weight but the most thing I hate is...said that this item has HDMI port which is not true....I check and ask that HDMI port before I decided to buy but got it today 2/2/2022 and no HDMI port...thank you...will return this item asap...
2970,"Everything is fine except the fact that the post said it has TWO USB ports. It only came with ONE USB port. This makes it pretty worthless considering it doesn’t even have an hdmi port. It’s also a 2019 model, not a 2021 so I lost out on 3 years of update support. Total scam"
2971,I have had several larger Chromebooks & I really like the size & weight of this one. Perfect of checking all the sites I visit. The touch on the keys is wonderful. Very happy with this computer.
2972,"El equipo llegó con un problema en la pantalla, me tocó devolverlo desde Colombia y el gasto de envío me costó 90 USD y Amazon solo me reembolsará 10 al final una perdida importante."
2973,"I like chromebook, it works well for what I need it. I use my old xp computer for everything I need, but I never take it on line, the chromebook works great for that."
2974,"Seen lots of bad review about charging issues but figured they'd handled it by now. NOPE the product is still the same bad stock. Samsung has lost a customer! Believe the reviews! This Chromebook is garbage, two weeks of use and the battery can't be charged, battery status light won't come on when plugged in. Lucky it died within the return window, Amazon gave a full refund."
2975,"Only 2 ports. One USB a and one USB c.  The product end date is June of 2027.  I read 2028 or 2029...It's the AUE date that really irks me.  I call BS on that, perfect light weight computer.  Good quality and wrecked with two ports and a cheezy expiration date"
2976,Battery life is RIDICULOUSLY AMAZING! it's great for what I need overall. The only issues I have is that the screen seems like cheap quality but doesn't disrupt vision at all and sometimes it gets slow depending on what it's trying to load but not slow enough that it's overly annoying.
2977,"I initially had a problem with my order but this seller did everything they could to resolve the issue and make it right. Good products, fast shipping, and great customer service."
2978,This laptop is great for my 9 year old son. The battery life is great. He charges it at night and it lasts all day at school in use. Easy to carry and the built in antivirus definitely takes some worries off me.
2979,"Recently bought an HP Stream, and can't stand it!  Seems to have a mind of its own.  So I bought this little Chromebook and it's just fine.  Easy for an old woman to use.  Nothing special about it, just a reliable little laptop."
2980,I needed access to my email and internet in the kitchen without dragging my laptop from my upstairs office every time.  The chromebook works for me at a great price.
2981,I love this. Faster and better than I had hopeful. I watched a bunch of youtube videos about chrome books and decided on this one. It works better than all the reviews I seen. I will buy this again.
2982,I can't believe how well this works. The size and weight combined with the INCREDIBLE BATTERY LIFE make this an amazing on-the-go computer.  Bright screen. Powerful enough to run linux apps without a problem in developer mode.
2983,Works great for the price - do not expect anything fancy. The screen is not great at all because of the viewing angles. This worked really well for a plane trip for about 5 hours and I was able to plug in my headphones and sound was loud and clear - screen not so great but it worked. One thing to note - battery life is amazing!!! I still had 60% after 2.5 movies I watched on the plane.
2984,"This computer is good for just the basics, I haven't tried to do too much with it. I'm using it for writing, and on that front it is more than adequate. Google docs has an offline feature as well which wasn't hard to set up. On google docs, the page is smaller than I'd like, but a quick pinch-zoom in or out on the touch pad set that to rights easily. It is not touch screen."
2985,"This chromebook is an awesome buy, especially for the price.  It was very easy to set up and operate.  I can download things very faster and everything I do runs very fast and smooth.  I purchased this to do homeschooling with my 7th grade daughter and it is perfect. My 4th grade daughter has an iPad but LOVES to get on this Samsung chromebook and play.  This was such a great buy that I am probably going to purchase another one so that both of my girls have one.  Definitely recommend"
2986,Worked OK for about six months but then I had to do a hard reset and when I did that I was unable to download any of the same apps Because they were not compatible with this device – in fact nothing in the Google store what is compatible with this piece of junk! Scrapping it and buying a Notebook like I should’ve done before my first and absolute last experience dealing with a Chromebook.
2987,"I love this Samsung Chromebook.  It is so easy to set up and use, and it's perfect for my everyday needs.  Excellent price.  Very satisfied.  You take it out of the package, charge it, and you're using it that day with absolutely no issues.  I just like still having a notebook/computer for email etc, things I don't like doing on my phone.  This is perfection."
2988,"First, this is not the newest 2021 model.  I'ts a 2019 model, so it will get guaranteed updates only until June of 2026, not 2028 as one would expect of a new model."
2989,I had a chrome 3 earlier which served me well. This is secondary laptop used only for surfing the web and for you tube TV. Because of its light weight I take it during my vacation.
2990,"Es genial, por su precio, te saca totalmente de apuros.  Es rápida, liviana y linda.  La calidad de imagen no es buena, pero eso se sabe cuando quieres pagar poco.  Por su precio, es genial!"
2991,Just a quick update! I bought my Samsung Chrome last month and it works perfect... very fast and great battery life.. no hassle setting it up. (remember to charge the battery first before attempting to browse)
2992,Love my chrome book is great for what I want it ! This chrome book is for work and doing modules plus with these modules I can watch the videos that are attach with it .
2993,"The field of view is pretty fixed to one angle and it is not even tangental to the screen. In other words, you need to tilt the screen further back in orther to see it right and if you move from there the image gets afected. I wish they would have invested a little more on the screen. Everything else is  cool."
2994,"I opted for the 32gb Chromebook since I just needed it for basic tasks (email, internet , Youtube, Netflix). It  worked fine right out of the box.  However, note that the C4 has a USB-C charging port, not the usual ports in previous models.  Also, just one USB port.  The screen quality is definitely inferior to the C2 and C3.  Also I had to download the Google Docs app, it was not pre-loaded."
2995,"She never used the old Dell we handed down to her, so we bought her the Samsung Chromebook, similar to what she uses in school. She will be going into the 5th grade this fall and her teacher recommended we go with a Chromebook. She took to it like a fish in water She loves it."
2996,"This was my third Samsung Chromebook, and the 2 previous were great. This time when I turned it on, the screen appeared, but no pointer. The touchpad was unresponsive. This is a pretty basic quality control issue that sent me on a search for another model."
2997,Bought this laptop for my mother in law as a a gift and she was only able to use it one time. Then every time she tries to use it she gets a screen that only shows chrome logo I have called a amazing customer support and they tried various troubleshooting and was advised our computer is defective. I have reached out to the seller and waiting for a reply
2998,"This chrome book works very good for what I use it for. Mostly zoom calls, YouTube,  and some web surfing. The camera is plenty good for zoom and the screen is plenty good for what I do. The speakers don’t seem really loud, but it doesn’t matter to me I almost always use a Bluetooth with it. The battery life is amazing. So far it is completely glitch free except for the eBay app. Ebay refuses to work on it. It’s a great laptop for basic use."
2999,"When a product only works for eleven days, how can you review its performance?  You rate the support.  Almost non existent.  Add some money and get a good product.  I know exactly the one to pu"
3000,"this piece of junk will NOT allow me to do anything without the upper right hand corner displaying the ""new tab, new window, bla bla bla.There is NO star available that shows the lowest rating which is ZERO!"
3001,"My husband loves chromebooks and when his old one died, we found this one, and he loves it. He isn't tech savvy and doesn't like anything fancy, so this was perfect for him.  The Samsung Chromebook 4 (2021 Model) 11.6"" is a great little computer. Its lightweight and compact. And the price was better than we could have imagined."
3002,"This was a replacement laptop. I really liked my other Samsung. The only drawback is the lack of volume, and the screen. It is still better than the Samsung 3. I really like Chromebooks, and was happy with the price."
3003,Very poor screen quality compared to my 2 previous same type of chromebooks whose batteries were used up. Now i have to turn one of the old ones on to look at photos to see if they are any good. Disappointed.
3004,I picked up 2 of these for my Niece and Nephew. For the price I can't complain. They acctually turn on fairly quick and both if the kids use then for tinker cad (web based 3d design)
3005,"The new chromebook arrived today.  This is my first use, so I can't speak to longevity.  However, it's what i need for my browsing, online purchasing and for watching youtube videos about fixing stuff around my home.  At work we used Lenovo.  High end and great.  Then we switched to Asus spin.  Even better except the Lenovo felt sturdier."
3006,"I bought the used one, that I don't know if all the screens of the this types are so bad. It is so hard to read the words on the screen."
3007,"I bought this laptop as a gift for my daughter for Roblox. Roblox is compatible and easy to install. The computer also has a lot of parental controls which I appreciate. Fast and good quality, can't beat this computer for the price!"
3008,"This is small and portable. Would fit in any backpack and some purses if you carry a big bag. It does what it’s supposed to do, as frustrating as that is sometimes. LOL! I don’t have any problems with the device. But I'm more of an Apple/Mac person so I can’t totally judge the Google-ness of it. Google operating systems just frustrate me. But 5 stars for the device!"
3009,It’s ease of use out of the box was apparent and it didn’t take long to set up. The size is small but if your just looking up stuff or reading it’s a step up from a kindle. Ideal for older folks or college students.
3010,I'll never buy another one after I put in pass word it just will not let in have to us as guest it will say sending code to unlock bot I never get the code
3011,The title says it. I only used this laptop twice and didn't leave it plugged in for long periods of time and it stopped working after two months. Buy something else.
3012,I love this chromebook! I had an older laptop that just wasn’t cutting it and wanted something small that I could do basic stuff on. I paired it with a Canon printer from Amazon that cost $49. I am pleased with it too!
3013,"Screen- I have an iPad Pro for movies etc, but the screen on this is very good, Speed-we have high speed fiber so apart from waiting a second or to longer speed is ok, never stalled or fluttered, battery life is good, light weight, but the price is probably the best benefit"
3014,Does what is expected at this price level. Checklist. #1 No crystal clear screen #2 No backlit keyboard. #3 No hdmi port.  ....So you mean it's not as good and capable as chromebooks costing $300 to $1k? Of course not! If you need what those offer then buy one of those.
3015,"I did everything I could to get the volume to control to work but still unsuccessful. Any hints or advice from anyone? I did follow the steps on checking that its not muted, tap on the time and click on the slider bar for volume and go to microphone and audio settings still not working. If it worked I will keep it but with this issues I will change my mind."
3016,"We received the Chromebook May 31st, but by the end of July it would no longer power up.  The power lamp is illuminated, but pushing the power button has no effect.  Amazon won't let us return this after 30 days, so we seem to be out of luck.  Terrible experience with this!  Buyer beware."
3017,crome os has problems this pc has trouble using most apps like prime video was choppy and slow had to use the web version to even watch anything i  later lost the laptop when I left it onto of my car but honestly don't miss it
3018,"This Chromebook was delivered to me on June 6, 2022.  On September 21, 2022 it stopped working.  Will not come on at all.  This was purchased to use when traveling.  We haven't gone anywhere since we got it so it was only use about a dozen times.  When I chatted with the Amazon robot I was told it is no longer returnable, is there anything else that they could HELP me with.  I guess I learned my lesson about order electronics from Amazon."
3019,"This is a nice compact Chromebook. It was purchased as a Father's Day gift. The battery life lasts a good while, around 5 hours with a good charge. The color is nice it works well so far."
3020,"The lot of thinks the HP did to make this computer price under 1000 dollars, can be a problem for the future of the brand Victus, they install 2 x 4Gb ram memory to save some pennies, some versions have 144hz display but a more ship video board, other 60hz with a better configuration, so hard to choose from the options."
3021,"Un diseño bueno, me gusto mucho, pero hay varias cosas que no me agradaron, primero que vienen con 2 RAMS de 4GB aunque si lo ponen en chiquito, la pantalla no es la mejor y por último, lo que más me decepcionó, solo 1 slot para ssd, al parecer el segundo slot se lo quitaron."
