It lasted 1 year only,"I bought my computer in Feb 2021. Now it is April 2022 and it shuts itself off without warning, with a defective pink screen. I'd be surprised if it lasts throughout the month. I'm not sure if this is due to planned obsolescence, or some other reason. Either way, I am not impressed. One year is not a good shelf life for a computer. My previous MacBook lasted only 2 years before it shut itself down for good. My older MacBook Pro from 2012 still works, so I know that it is not me that is the problem.",manda,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on April 19, 2022",7 people found this helpful

Amazing Student Laptop,I’ve only been using my MacBook Air for a few weeks now but it’s already the best purchase I’ve made in a long time. I was debating getting either a windows or an apple computer and decided in the end to get this MacBook Air. The screen itself is amazing and I love how smooth the keyboard types.

Good laptop and amazing delivery,Got this as a gift during prime day sale. It came very promptly. I also live in an apartment complex and have a special kiosk system for packages. It's nice when I am out of town which I was when the package came. It came earlier than expected. I don't usually use the kiosk but they left it in there for me all securely. Laptop works great. The gift was a success as well! The only thing is that the camera could be better. My boyfriend needed a laptop due to his Lenovo shutting down and a nice camera (his old one stopped working) to confirm his identity for online tests. He tested it out and it was pretty blurry for a pricey laptop which is why I give this 4 stars instead of 5.,Amazonian Reviewer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 16, 2022",26 people found this helpful

Two broken MacBooks  in two days...,"I was so excited to buy my first MacBook.  Opened the first one and nothing zip, zero, dead. Charged it, called Apple, who told me to return it.  It took over an hour to get Amazon to accept the return and ship me a replacement.  Next morning get MacBook number 2- super excited because I open it and it comes on and sings a song! Loved it for the 3 hours it worked.  It updated and Locked me out.  Did everything they told me to do online, call Apple that admits they are having this issue and I can return it for another one! Since it’s not 14 days old.  No thanks.  I am done.  Since Apple told me to return it this time Amazon was amazing and is picking it up for return tomorrow.  This was a crappy experience.

This is by far the best laptop out there.,"OMG! This is such an incredible product. Perfect keyboard, perfect weight, perfect battery life, perfect trackpad, perfect performance, perfect Touch ID, perfect feel, perfect build, perfect look, perfect size, perfect stereo sound, perfect screen, perfect noise absence as not having a fan! I mean, it doesn't have a fan and it doesn't get hot most of the times. WTF?! It's the only laptop I've been able to use in my bed for x amount of hours and it is sooo comfortable to do it. It truly is one of the best products out there and it is totally worth the investment, because that's how I see it, not even as spending, that's just how good it is. I'm enthusiastic because this is for sure the best device Apple has created in terms of price/what you get, and it will probably stay in that position for a couple of years. This is game-changing and revolutionary. The computer feels as if it will last 10+ years, honestly. I highly recommend it. BTW, it is so good my girlfriend decided to get one for herself because she just couldn't get over the first time she used it, and just how beautiful it is and pleasurable to look at from any perspective... This laptop is so ridiculously perfect that you can even open it with one hand and in just a couple of seconds, you will be ready to use it as it has an always-on feature that allows you to get down to the working right away. That is probably the best feat. True Tone is also really good, as it is automatic brightness adjustment and dark mode, they sit together perfectly well. Get it! You won't regret it at any moment.

Due to the fact that I am an avid apple user, it is super beneficial that all my photos, passwords, and documents are so conveniently transferred to each of my devices.

Incredibly Fast & Powerful,"I absolutely love my new MacBook.  When it arrived I answered a few questions, connected it to my WiFi and off I went.  It has been a buttery smooth experience.  Keyboards are one of those things that are dependent on user preferences, but for me it's the best feeling keyboard I have ever owned.  Many professional reviewers agree it's terrific. The multi-touch pad is brilliant, and now that I know the many different combinations of fingers and movements I zip around getting work done.  For example a two-finger swipe right goes back to the previous web page, no need to hit that back button.  It is also custom configurable to your touchpad needs. What I appreciate most is the total cost of ownership value.  I bought Final Cut Pro X when it came out 10 years ago yet there was no charge to get the latest version downloaded from the App Store. It does everything I need without an ongoing subscription fee like others have.  I still can't get used to how fast it works, it took me an hour to render a video on my old Mac but this MacBook did it in just a few minutes.  And it's cool and quiet! I'm using a huge 70"" 4K monitor as my secondary monitor.  Battery life is ridiculous.  I plug it in every 2 or 3 days depending on my workload, which is several hours per day.  I think the web camera is fine for me and many notebooks use this same 720p size.  I join one Zoom conference per week, so it doesn't really matter. The one thing I hope gets updated with the next release are the ports.  I'm using a hub because it only has two thunderbolt ports.

I worked with numerous Apple technicians who also witnessed the problem.  After hours and hours over months of patiently working with them, I was told we’d try a complete replacement of the OS and if that didn’t work, I’d get a replacement. When it didn’t, I was told I’d now have to take disk images and record dates and times it failed. They’d have the “engineers” get involved.  “The engineers” for one faulty laptop after I’d been patient for two years doing everything they asked, and they witnessed the problem.  Two years, hours upon hours of my life and a false commitment to make it right. I’ve been a Mac user for decades.  No longer.

MacBook Air is Amazing!!,"The new MacBook Air with the M1 chip is overall amazing! It’s definitely worth the money! The all-new chipset has turned the Air lineup into a beast! My only complaint is the camera. Apple has stuck to the same 720p camera and claiming the neural engine makes it better? I’m not convinced it’s any better, and it’s really a disappointment compared to other notebooks in its class. Also, the inability to adjust the keyboard brightness from the keyboard. It’s adjustable from the settings and easily accessible… but it’s just an inconvenience. It’s a petty complaint but for the money, this should be standard (it previously was on older models). Aside from that, this notebook is amazing! Lightning fast and the best battery life I’ve ever seen!

While the transition was a bit rocky at first, now that I somewhat know what I'm doing, I absolutely love this computer! It's small and lightweight, but still feel solid in your hands. The processor is incredibly fast as well as the load up time. I can get signed in and have my notes up in seconds (literally, no joke!), something I could never do with a Windows laptop (I should mention that I bought my computer directly from Apple and upgraded to the 16BG RAM and more storage, which helps immensely with load up time). For those that say the camera is bad- I don't think so. Is it the most amazing camera ever? No, but if you really need higher camera quality for your job, then you should probably go with a Macbook Pro instead of Air. For a Zoom meeting it works just fine.

screen cracks from built-in camera,"My son loved his Apple laptop while it worked. The screen has cracked twice. As we can see from the image, it cracks from the top middle where Apple put the camera. My son used the laptop a lot, but he did not mistreat his laptop. I generally do favor Apple products. Apple already repaired this once. I paid nothing for that repair. However, it has now failed twice for the same issue. I feel this is a serious engineering defect. I likely will take it to Apple so they can diagnose it. I don't particularly care if I get the laptop back or not at this point since I suspect it may break again within six months. Unfortunately I cannot recommend the Apple Macbook Air due to this defect. I do expect a laptop to last at least 2 or 3 years. Apple normally makes great products and I hold Apple in high esteem. This product unfortunately is not one of them. Not all of the Apple laptops will face this issue. But if you search the web you will find others who have experienced this same problem. I am hoping Apple stress tests newer versions of their laptops to address this issue in the future. Apple may need to modify the camera assembly or display assembly. Or relocate the camera to a different location like the corner of the display.",Beach Boy,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on August 29, 2022",3 people found this helpful
MacBook Air Review,"The MacBook Air is a great purchase for a laptop. It has many new features that will be helpful for school and work. The laptop is affordable, portable, and has the new M1 chip. The way the laptop is affordable is because you will be able to pay for it monthly so you will not spend all your money at once. You will also be getting what you pay for with its latest features. It is also portable because it is light weight and slim. This will help you carry it anywhere you need to and will be very helpful if you go to college, since you will be carrying from class to class. Lastly, it has a new M1 processing chip. This M1 chip makes it better than any past MacBooks, it keeps you laptop running smooth and fast, it also gives you long battery life. I really do recommend you purchase the MacBook Air, it is worth buying.",Mekhayla Chieg,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 7, 2021",One person found this helpful

"In many respects, Surface better, but Mac Air with M1 has some advantages","I have both an iPad and iPhone so I thought is would be make sense to have a Mac so everything is in one ecosystem, as it were.  To some extent this has indeed proved true and useful.  I am coming from a Surface Pro 7.  The Mac Air's battery life is much less than advertised.  The claim is around 10 hours, I doubt I get 5, and I am mostly doing internet browsing and Word stuff.  Battery life from fully charged was about 1 hour while on Zoom.  The battery life of the Surface is better.  Word for Mac is a little different than Word for a PC, but the differences are minor and manageable.  But documents open more slowly on the Mac, and mine has the M1 chip.  On the Surface, documents usually open immediately.  On the Mac it might take 5 seconds, not an eternity, but a little annoying.  The Surface boots up much faster than the Mac.  I have a DVD with a number of workouts on it.  I could not get any individual workouts to open using the Mac's native software.  So I downloaded VLC.  It works fine on the Mac, but takes a long time to open, about a minute.  This seems to be true of any software not downloaded from the App store, including Firefox.  There do not appear to be Mac apps for either.  On the other hand, the Mac has a better screen than the Surface.  While the Surface is quite a good laptop, it is a marginal tablet, and I almost never use it as a tablet.  When I am not sitting at a desk, I prefer the Mac because the two parts cannot come apart as can happen on a Surface.  The new Mac keyboard works great, maybe a tie with the Surface.  So a mixed bag.  As I mentioned, I like having everything in one ecosystem, so likely that is enough of a benefit to keep the Mac.  I am mulling over upgrading to the MacBook Pro 13 because of its bigger battery, but don't know if I want to spend the extra money.",Diver,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on December 13, 2020",6 people found this helpful

The Best Laptop I have ever owned coming from a windows person,"This thing is amazing. I have owned several windows gaming laptops and this is hands down the best laptop I have ever purchased. The build quality is amazing, the chassis, hinge, keyboard, and mousepad all feel very high quality. the laptop is light and easy to carry around. The battery lasts what feels like a lifetime. The computer does not get hot at all (even after some heavy video editing and transcoding). Apple has truly made the best laptop on the market. Now to the negatives: I have read that the OS excessively uses virtual memory to speed up the system. After doing some initial tests I can confirm that this is true. What does this mean? this means that the Internal SSD might not last as long as it should because of the excessive write and read to the Solid state drive. I don't know I this is by design or what but it definitely feels kinda crummy for Apple to do this. I would still recommend this computer to anyone needing a laptop for school, creative work, or just general use.

Very happy,"I love this laptop. It replaced an Acer aspire 5 slim, which was quite heavy, and had a battery that lasted five hours. In power saver mode. It was only two years old and rarely used until I started a new job and school. I had my MacBook going from 8:30 AM to 8:30 PM pretty much consistently, and it still had 55% battery life. Because I have an iPhone, I can make calls and send texts with it. My iPad can be used for sidecar, which is basically wireless screen mirroring, allowing me to have a portable second monitor. The mac doesn’t skip a beat- I can leave it closed overnight, and everything is exactly the same the next morning without crashing or reloading. It’s not at all heavy, and the size is exactly what a laptop should be. The Mac OS not supporting steam titles thing isn’t a huge deal- If I want a gaming machine, I have a desktop. For getting things done, this is an absolutely perfect daily driver, and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it to anyone. My one gripe is lack of USB-A ports, but I’ll buy an adapter and move on with my life. Overall, try a MacBook Air… You’ll like it.",darkoverlord5,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 27, 2022",5 people found this helpful

Workhorse,So for the most part I use this for when I am traveling or out and about for my business. I find it the right size for the job I am doing and take advantage of Apples cloud storage and ways of using other Mac's as storage for information so this doesn't use storage much at all. Where this is nice is the quick user functionality it has in access these documents or programs needed seamlessly and being able to help keep my business moving on the road. Most of the time I am using browser programs to access the business info or using the cloud to access files back at the home base which is the new Mac Mini with an external hard drive that houses the business information. I find that the size makes a great traveling companion for onsite work. When connecting to a shared internet connection it is nice knowing that the channel is mostly secure and when using my iPhone shares cell connection and new chips they can help create a safe network for my means of work. If you are debating getting one for business I recommend using their cloud storage so you eliminate the focus on storage anxiety and makes it more worth it in the long run of having a user interface focused laptop. Also the battery for most of the work I am doing lasts me a week with heavy workload 4 days max. Honestly you can't get too much better for a long lasting Apple hardware focused product.,Michael Mccarthy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on July 3, 2021",2 people found this helpful

Buy this laptop! You won’t be disappointed.,"I love this little computer! When I was looking for a laptop to buy, I almost went with a used, older MacBook Air. I decided to just spend the extra money and get a brand new computer and the newest model and I’m so happy I did because Apple’s M1 chip is impressive. After two months of owning this laptop, I think my favorite thing is the battery life. For lighter tasks (web browsing, listening to music, steaming Netflix etc), the battery could last the entire day, and I love how I can take this thing anywhere with me without having to lug a charger around as well. For heavier tasks, it of course doesn’t last all day but you get a lot of hours out of the battery. It rarely gets hot, and doesn’t even have a fan, so you know how efficient that chip is running. I also love the fanless design because I can have it with me in my bed or anywhere and not worry about blocking vents or getting dog hair in those fans. I don’t use it for anything crazy, mainly just work and personal stuff, along with frequent streaming and occasionally I’ll fire up the Sims 4 (and it runs beautifully by the way). But I’m never not impressed by how quick it is, opens applications almost instantly and wakes instantly. Also, I am new to Mac with this purchase but have owned iPhones for a decade and I love the seamless integration jumping between applications on your laptop and phone. So far I’m loving Big Sur and basically this is just a laptop that would be great for almost anyone.",Jackie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on April 4, 2021",18 people found this helpful

This one is with the new M1 chip and is an upgrade from my previous Mac....which I loved.  Faster, better, more battery.  What's not to like.  And frankly the price for the machine is a bargain.  I do not use my Mac for gaming, heavy downloads, large graphics so can't comment but is why the Air is a perfect choice over the Pro.  Transferring files etc from my previous Mac was a snap and now I have my ""old"" Mac on the M1 so everything works better.  I was a bit surprised everything is the same size and weight....but that's likely because I didn't look at those specs before purchase.  One sweet thing about the Mac is it comes about 70% charged so just open and start.  If you are considering a Mac or have one and are thinking about upgrade just do it.

Great computer—mediocre camera,"The camera is not really current. Especially for a laptop in this price range. It’s not much, if any, better than the toshiba laptop I got at Walmart for $400 back in like 2010. It is actually fine for me because I don’t rely on it for work or anything. But if you rely on it for virtual meetings, FaceTime, zoom, etc, you will be disappointed in the camera quality. I have very little need for the camera so it doesn’t bother me personally. But the camera is absolutely embarrassing for what has been named the laptop of the year by many, and I would agree, it’s a great computer. Great battery life, super fast charging, very light, not quiet—silent. Quiet implies there is a minimal amount of noise. There is no fan in this and it’s is literally silent.

Fast for CERTAIN things,"So forget about all the other reviews. This is the skinny from a higher learning teacher: Is it fast? Yes.

How is rendering audio or video? Good, BUT…My iMac 5k from 2017 with 4gb of video ram is faster with the few renderings I have done. The following is what surprised me (especially after reading all the fab reviews of battery): I put my Mac Air on sleep mode when I shut it down. Didn’t use it for a couple days, came back to get it and the battery was completely dead. Zero! I was VERY surprised.  I can always leave an MSI, Lenovo, HP, on sleep mode for a week or more.

Great Upgrade,I replaced on older 2009 MacBook Pro with this new model from Apple. It has the new M1 chip and it is fast. For the type of things I do in a home office this is lightning fast. I don't do a lot of editing of videos or play video games on it so my work load is pretty mundane compared to others. I like it though because it is lightweight when I take it to my den or on a trip in my computer bag. The battery lasts a long time and the keyboard is very responsive. Love the screen clarity. I have not found any of my regular apps having any difficulty running on the new chip. I did set up a new camera connection app to see how it would do and had no issues either. It is running in the background and when they update to work specifically with the new chip it should work even better. I don't have any negatives with this computer.

Constant problems with Apple...,"First, I will say I bought this at an Apple store, not on Amazon.  So this is a review of the product.  For many years, I have found Apple products to be overrated and overpriced.  That includes this product.  For example, as others have stated - no good ports (you need to buy all kinds of attachments), no touchscreen, etc.  And, of course, there are compatibility issues with anything not made by Apple.  But my biggest beef is that it is not reliable.  I recently downloaded Monterey - and am having all kinds of problems.

They sent it out for a new battery under warranty which was to take 3-5 days and they have had it a week now and haven’t completed the repair yet.

HOWEVER, I was expected an SD card slot that is not there.  That was disappointing but, again, an adapter can solve that.

"Great, but 8GB of ram not enough at times, trackpad has issues","Took my chance and bought one used off Amazon warehouse deals. It's brand new except the warranty has only a few months left. Can't complain at all! This computer is awesome as I upgraded from 2013 Macbook Pro Retina. It's way faster. But 8GB of ram will be slow at times, and the laptop gets hot during summer months. Also the trackpad has a tendency of dragging instead of clicking when you're clicking around really fast. Like when you're trying to get that hot concert ticket, and you click really fast on Ticketmaster, it drags the text or link instead of clicking on it like it should which causes a second of two of delay. I hope they get this fixed but it's unlikely they will ever notice this. Most people don't use trackpad to click as fast as me.",Yiu Wong,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on August 2, 2022",28 people found this helpful

Good so far...,"I'm new to the Mac world, at least since the early days in the 80s. So far it has been a pleasant experience and I like the stock software and layout. I haven't really had to purchase any additional apps to be able to do the things that I've become accustomed to on PCs, so there is a nice learning curve. I do have a couple of constructive criticisms, that are not specific to the MacBook Air, though. In the future, I'd like to see touchscreens included on their laptop models (being a former teacher of persons with autism, they really benefit from the additional input method). Also, the Retina display is awesome, but maybe in some of their higher priced laptops like the MacBook Pro they can start using OLEDs as model upgrades.

Lack of ports.,"Apple makes an incredible product. But their contempt for the customer knows no end. This is especially exemplified by the reduction of ports to only two on the MacBook Aires and even some Powerbooks. And EVERYTHING is put into those two. The separate power port is gone. The separate video out port is gone. In some cases, even the audio out port is gone. All they leave you with is two USB ports which they expect you to use for everything. For a lot of people, like myself, multiple ports are needed for constant use. They are needed for external hard drives (especially for file backup where you don't want to use the Apple Cloud which is susceptible to NSA snooping), external DVD and CD burners, special printers that do NOT work with Bluetooth, special mice for people like myself with handicaps that make trackpads difficult, drawing pads, etc. etc. etc. And don't tell me to just get an external hub. I have tried them all and NONE of them provide proper power to external tools that need it. Plus they frequently get hotter than a firecracker. In summation, Apple needs to start giving consideration to the Customer's needs and not just to some fancy ""updated"" technology. Bluetooth does not work dependably and is a real pain most of the time and is not available for all external tools. We NEED physical ports. Please put them back on the MacBooks, especially the ""Aires"". And stop taking them off of the Mac Cubes. The last one I bought had no audio port causing extreme problems with my video production work. PLEASE APPLE, BRING BACK THE PORTS.

Almost Perfect (Except for crappy webcam),Upgraded from Mid 2015 base Macbook Air. This thing is like 100x faster. It is amazing. I got used to the USB-C and bought a little hub that makes it a non issue. Actually like it better since USB C is faster. Battery life on my old MacBook was amazing. This one is literally at least double that. Pro tip do not use chrome on any Mac or MacBook it is energy and efficient and will kill your battery (took me a while to learn this). Webcam is only bad part but all Macbooks have substandard webcams compared to iPhones.

I've ran heavy games and video editors and its done amazing! it's even beat some of my other $8,000 MacBooks! It's very light weight ( 2.8 pounds ) and is very thin but yet durable. It doesn't feel cheap like some laptops at this price point, It feels very premium with the metal body and soft keys and the retina display. The track pad is VERY large for the size of this laptop. I also love how it's fan-less so it never makes any noise which is another reason why it's good for students. ( video calls, etc. ) My one and only complaint is the camera quality. It looks nice if you have good lighting but if you're in bad lighting it looks like a potato filming. But if you can get passed that it's great. I also love how the keyboard is backlit, it helps a lot if you're in a dark environment.

Unacceptable,First off I’m giving this one star just so you’ll read this honest review. I brought this Mac book and have been satisfied with functionality and speed but I’m giving 1 star because apple really nickel and dimes us as customers. The usb c cable that comes with the laptop is not even close to being one of the best on the market. I attempted to use it to power my elgato game capture card and the card would not read. Kept saying I need a usb3.0 to work. So I then used the cable that came with my Samsung external hard drive and bang it work immediately. I spent a lot of money on this laptop just to receive a weak cable with it. The cable is literally only good for charging and light duty file transfer which I guess is ok for most people. But for me it was not. Apple already doesn’t give us headphones anymore and they don’t even have the decency to give us a very good cable. 1star because for this price I could have built a computer or brought a prebuilt one.

It's the camera hardware and it hasn't been updated in ages. My zoom calls are so grainy and bad even with decent light. A $1000 laptop with 10 year old front camera is unacceptable. Camera is very important to me. Especially now that we all are quarantined at home and making zoom calls all the time.,Adi,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on November 27, 2020","1,496 people found this helpful"

Apple will mess up your password and you will be unable to reset it,"Theres a serious glitch where you can't use touch ID if drained from dead battery. Then it will ask you for a password. Unclear if this is an apple ID password or whatever, but mine didn't work. Tried every combo I knew. And then there is no option for reset password. Just none at all.

Apple won't sell parts. Not worth repairing.,"My 2018 MBA died (logic board).  It was 2-1/2 years old.  Apple quoted $500 to repair it.  The repair came with a 90 day warranty.  They told me that if I had purchased Apple Care, it would have been covered.  If I had purchased Apple Care on all of the Apple computers I've purchased over the past 25 years I could have bought 2-3 brand new MacBook Airs.

Great specs for an entry-level laptop.,"I was looking to upgrade from my current dual core intel i7 Windows laptop and tablet. The 2020 MacBook Air M1 screen is sharp, the M1 processor performance is similar to intel i7 quad core for most uses . This laptop is fan-less and gets very warm/hot only when constantly exporting very large 5Gb+ files - otherwise it runs cool to cold. I edit photos on this laptop and my editing software opens much faster and the edits occur very quickly. The 8Gb ram/256 Gb ssd combo in this laptop is fast and responsive. The Mac OS memory management allows 8Gb to be more than enough for my projects. The M1 cpu performance and battery life for the MacBook Air M1 easily exceed those of my dual core i7 Windows laptop and tablet. My photo editing software runs faster and is more responsive than on my Windows devices. Also, the MacBook Air M1 performance seems the same whether on battery or ac power unlike my Windows devices. This laptop is a fantastic entry-level device but hard core gamers and video creators should upgrade to the Pro models for the larger/more vibrant screen, richer audio, cooling fans, additional usb-c ports, sd card slot, dual monitor capability, and more ram/ssd options. I purchased this used base model used at a substantial savings over the list price which made it a fantastic value. I would suggest most users get the 512Gb or larger internal ssd so you won't need an external ssd for video/music storage. I currently use external ssd drives to store my large files so the small 256Gb ssd size in the base model was not an issue. The only possible drawbacks for the MacBook Air are there are only 2 usb-c data/charging ports so you may need to purchase a dock if you need multiple connection options, (or use older usb accessories), there is no sd card slot, and software apps are still being updated for the M1 cpu. I run Microsoft Office 365 on my MacBook Air. I notice that Office 365 takes a second or two longer to load but once loaded Office 365 runs as fast as it does on Windows.  I don't use this laptop for gaming, video editing, or to connect multiple monitors so I can't comment on those uses. I was not expecting this level of performance from an entry-level device. Don't get caught up in the hype that this base model can replace the MacBook Pro models for heavy work loads or professional use - it doesn't have the heat distribution (fans) to dissipate the heat to prevent thermal throttling under heavy computing or gaming. For most users, just use and enjoy your 2020 MacBook Air M1!!",Dan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on April 7, 2022",

Apple is the greatest company of all time!,"I bought my first Mac in 1986 and my first 100 shares of Apple in 1992. No one could have dreamed what Apple was to become. And I never believed that I'd get a job working for Apple, and add to those shares over the next 14 years through the employee stock ownership program. Every 3 months, I get a dividend that's 4 times what I originally paid for those 100 shares, which have now become 6428 shares through reinvesting those dividends.",John the 19th,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on February 1, 2022",
This is the generation to get your first Mac or upgrade.,"First time Macbook owner. Really happy with the MacBook Air. Don't let the lack of a fan be off-putting. The only time it gets even remotely warm is when rendering a video in iMovie. Even then, it's by no means hot to the touch. This is probably the most fail proof laptop out right now and dare I say, ever. The lack of a fan eliminates the last mechanical part and means this laptop have no moving parts. The soldered in m.2 storage and committing to your RAM choice for the life of the laptop is my only complaint. So far I'm not finding 8gb of RAM to be an issue. Most of the programs for Mac OS are pretty well optimized for the M1 chip. So Everything feels to work pretty smoothly. The battery life is next level. Over all it's more powerful, cooler and the battery lasts longer than ever. If you have been wanting to get your first MacBook or have been batting around the idea of an upgrade.

Flimsy screen,"I left my brand new M1 Macbook pro in my car for an hour and now the screen looks like a Picasso painting.  Both Amazon and Apple refuse to pay for repairs because apparently this is considered an accident rather than a manufacturer's defect, even though I bought it only two months ago.  So I'm out $700 to repair a two month old computer.  I would heavily advise against buying one of these, because if this is considered normal rather than a manufacturer's defect, then 80 degree heat is enough to damage the screen.  This means that they're essentially useless if your air conditioner goes out and you will be left with a repair bill that is half the value of the computer.",Patrick Walsh,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on June 25, 2021",10 people found this helpful

It's a good upgrade from my old MacBook Pro,"I have an aging MacBook Pro (15"") which I use a great deal. At some point I know it will cease to function well, so I made the leap to the smaller 2020 MacBook Pro (13"") with the M1 chip. It runs fast, stays cool, and after a month or so of pretty constant usage, has been doing beautifully. Some of the newer features like the touch screen pad have taken me some time to get used to, but I'm learning to appreciate them. A word of caution...not all apps and software are quite ready for the M1 chip / Big Sur yet. I'm still straddling the world of two MacBooks, the older one running High Sierra and the new one running Big Sur, because some of the apps don't work perfectly on the new MacBook. But all in all, it's a good transition for me.","Amazon Customer in Raleigh, NC",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on August 28, 2021",2 people found this helpful

"The M1 chip is no joke! Macbook just works, period.","I love my MBP! As a Windows user since the early 90's, I've gone through all sorts of computer systems; desktops and laptops, name-brand pre-built systems and custom builds and I've got to say, Apple knows how to construct an absolutely gorgeous and solid device with premium build quality. My interest in Windows began waning after Windows 7 and has been a downward spiral since, in terms of user experience, maintenance, bugs, endless updates, updates for those updates, etc. I was not going to stick around for another lackluster release with Windows 11 on the way (which my fairly new and high-end laptop at the time didn't even officially qualify for the upgrade). The learning curve was not too steep and has been more rewarding in the past several weeks of use. I forget how much of a pleasure it was to use a computer that the developers actually understand the needs of the customer base. I am equally amazed by just how seamlessly everything just seems to work. I used to think in terms of Apple monopolizing the market by offering a product that they built both on the hardware and software side, but that is in part why it just works so flawlessly.",Travis F.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 15, 2021",One person found this helpful

powering of a macbook pro M1 unreliable only after 3 weeks of use.,"I was excited to get the new macbook pro M1 as reviews described it as a very fast powerhouse computer. My first impression was strong. I started to play with all the features my old MacBook Pro is missing. I was excited about extending the screen to my iPad pro will be able to paint in photoshop (with Sidecar). This feature is completely underwhelming and unpractical to use (mostly due to how interface of this feature is set up). The next feature I was excited to try was installing iPad/iPhone app to MacBook Pro... Well, this works here and there, applications are crashing... again very underwhelming. Three weeks later my new MacBook Pro started having issues when plugging into the power source through thunderbolt. After I unplug it from power, the second time when plugin it wouldn't charge. I had to unplug the thunderbolt cable both from the power adapter and from a computer and plug it back to the charger first then to the computer in order for mac to charge again. I ran self-diagnostic on startup and it would freeze. Luckily I was still in the Amazon window to return this now broken computer. I don't understand how Apple machines became so unreliable. Now I'm hesitant to order another Apple computer as this is the very first new computer I ever purchased turns out to be a lemon.",Amanda Hudak,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on June 15, 2021",6 people found this helpful

"The screen is easy to crack where the laptop folds shut, as small debris can get inside unseen","My laptop lasted less than 4 months before it died. I talked to an Amazon rep who was responsive and put me in touch with an Apple rep, who was curt. He suggested bringing it to a local shop licensed by Apple to diagnose and repair, but he said they didn't have an appointment for almost a week. At the shop, they were much more responsive but warned that a small crack in the bottom of the screen that happened when I close it one day likely caused the problem, would not be covered by the warranty and would cost $700 to fix. (Fingers crossed it is something else, but he said he was 95 percent sure this would be the case.) Two issues with my 2020 Apple MacBook Pro with Apple M1 Chip (13-inch, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD Storage): 1) Debris can fall into the seam between the keyboard and screen unseen and 2) I kept having to adjust the brightness; even though I set the screen to be bright, it kept returning to dim. My other complaint is that the Apple rep was curt. The tech at the shop said he sees a lot of screen issues and highly recommended by the warranty-plus plan, which costs over $200, for two years, I think, and then $100/year.",Mary,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 20, 2021",9 people found this helpful

This Macbook turned me away from Apple,"I am an Apple guy. I converted from PC ~ 2008 and have loved every apple device until the IPhone X and the new Macbook with M1 chip. Where to start? First, as is a major complaint for everyone, the Macbook pro has all of two ports (yes yes, I know, this was listed in the specs. It doesn't make it ok). If I need to be plugged in, I have 1 port remaining. It is incredibly idiotic that I have to buy a dock to expand my ports. Oh and the ports are only Thunderbolt in Apple's continuing stupidity of forcing the market to adopt its garbage. I did not buy a Mac Air for a reason, yet the Macbook pro comes with all the limitations of an Air. The new charging cable lacking magnetic attachment makes zero sense. The track pad is beyond finicky to the point of being useless. I have no bluetooth connectivity. I get incessant windows telling me to log into podcasts or apple music. I see zero performance improvements with the M1chip. In fact, doing a side-by-side video recording with Quicktime (all parameters equalized) I have a severe lag with M1 Mac, but not with the Intel driven machine. And the touch bar is about the worst idea ever. I constantly dim the back light, or go back on web pages because of it. Absolute trash. I bought this computer for work and will be designating it as a laptop for our interns, because that's how terrible it is. I will not be duped into replacing this hunk of garbage with the forthcoming Macbook Pro in which the port and charging issues have been fixed.",chris kaffer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 4, 2021",34 people found this helpful

"DO NOT, DO NOT buy it from Amazon!!","I bought my mac pro 13"" M1 chip from Amazon last year. Suddenly, after one year, the laptop didn't turn on anymore. So I took it to the Apple Store, and they told me the laptop had a significant hardware issue that would cost almost $700 to repair. So I called Amazon about why they sold me a defective device, and they didn't do anything about it and didn't take ANY responsibility for it. Why would an Apple device, this price, not work after one year? So DO NOT DO NOT buy any expensive device from Amazon. I am disappointed with Amazon and won't buy any costly device from them anymore. Buy these devices from Apple Store; it is worth paying a bit more instead of $700 or even more again for a defective product. That's enough!",Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on July 20, 2022",
Worst Computer I Have Ever Owned,The day I got it the computer kept crashing to a pink screen. The computer is so slow it can't even load Chrome properly and maxes out ram just searching Google. The computer gets hot all the time and the fan almost never comes on. The rubber around the screen is falling off. The Apple store says they likely won't honor the repairs because im a few days out of warranty. Just fixing the rubber alone is $400 to $500. Now I have to sell it on Amazon for $300.

Apple sent my MacBook Pro with NO INSTRUCTIONS.  Horrible customer service.,"The Apple MacBook Pro looks great and, based on all the reviews, it probably is.  However, as a 71 year old man, accustomed to using Windows for the past 12 years, this new MacBook Pro was very different.  The part of it that really makes me angry is the fact that it came with NO INSTRUCTIONS.  I need something to look at and do things, step by step.  It started off with a Voice tutorial thing that was as confusing and ridiculous as anything I've ever seen.  Trying to access the ""guide"" on my cell phone while trying to set up this MacBook was as frustrating as anything I've ever attempted.  For a big company, like Apple, to fail so miserably at KEEPING IT SIMPLE, is a horrible error.  I will struggle through this but I'm not happy about how difficult this is for me.

"A Great Laptop, but buy the MacBook Air","I bought this laptop primarily for college. As someone who has dealt with both devils by the name of Apple and Microsoft, the operating system differences don't bother me (although, one thing I did find is that when I go home and I'm not able to do any gaming, it can be a bit of an irritation, but that was never why I bought this laptop to begin with). The screen and battery life on this thing are amazing. My previous laptops had terrible screens and had a max battery life of about two hours. This laptop, between using it for school, doing photo editing, graphic design, coding, and video editing, can easily last me up to two days or even more. The one thing I will say is that frequently in order for me see things most of the time, I need the screen cranked up past 50% brightness most of the time. I like the touch bar, I barely use function keys in most applications and the apps that do use them have the buttons on the touch bar anyways. I will say though unless you care about the touch bar, a slightly larger battery, and a fan being inside this machine (which for the record, with all of my use of heavy exports and edits, has never once turned on), just buy the MacBook Air. For school especially, it will get you across fine. The 8 GB model is also superb in most of the tasks I need to accomplish. I mean, it has similar performance in what I need for compared to my PC with a Ryzen 3700X, and RTX 3070, and 32GB of RAM. There were a couple of times where webpages tried to use more than 8GB of RAM and that caused some trouble, but after turning on an ad-blocker I never had that issue again. macOS has superb memory management, which allows for someone semi-professional like me to get by with it just fine.",Zach Nichols,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on December 17, 2021",3 people found this helpful

I am an apple girl through and through (watch, phone, AirPods). To say that I was over the moon receiving my first MacBook was an understatement. I've been testing it out for about a week now. It came in perfect condition. No scratches or problems with the screen. This computer is FAST when it comes to everything. As soon as you open it, it is on. I seriously can't catch it off no matter how little I open it. Every web page pops up quick and loads quicker. I'm amazed that I can text through this MacBook and it synced all of my stuff from the cloud effortlessly. It has a Touch Bar that is insanely cool and in my opinion, useful. The battery life. OMG the battery life. I purposely did everything in my power to drain it. I am on day 7 of using it without charging it and it is at 41%. Now, I haven't been on it all day everyday. I have mainly used it to write, read, and text. However, I've used for a good 4 hours each day. If you're a college student who needs a reliable computer this one is for you!!!! It is 100% worth every penny. If you want coverage for the MacBook always go through apple. They will give you the best bang for your buck.",Amanda Costa,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on July 22, 2021",

"M1 is not ready for prime-time, in my opinion.","There are too many baffling oddball problems -- like it won't do portrait mode on a displayLink monitor.  It has problems with docking stations that ought to work just fine -- despite me turning off sleep and screen locking, when in clamshell closed mode, sometimes it won't wake up and has to be hard power-cycled or zapped to get it to boot back up.  These issues are virtually nonexistent on Intel silicon of the same era/OS revision level.

Have to constantly restart to get things running normally, something I never had to do with previous generations of the MacBook pro. Won't miss the touch bar when they phase it out and only use it occasionally because it's there. Another interesting thing that I have found is that the speakers are not great: just ok.

Great laptop!,I was a bit skeptical ordering a MacBook from Amazon but it was really easy and simple. When it came I was so happy and the unboxing/setup was simple. I’ve had it for about 3/2 months so far and haven’t had a problem. Only thing is I’ve had “assistantd” pop up on my screen and it wouldn’t go away so I had to restart the laptop. But overall great for schoolwork and pretty mid with running games and FaceTime.,Lorena,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 23, 2022",

Amazing!,I needed a laptop for school and chose a MacBook since it has a handoff feature and the iCloud stuff gets synced which helps a lot! You can copy a text on your iPad and it can be pasted right away to your MacBook which is amazing! I got mine with 16GB ram and it works great. It never lags and I play sims 4 on it to with over 30GB of custom content (cc) and mods. My game will never lag it loads super fast and works seamlessly. The fans rarely come on whenever I’m doing schoolwork. They do however come in during sims gameplay but that’s normal since it’s a heavy game. It doesn’t get hot either. The battery life is great. I’ll use it 2-4 hrs/day and the battery can last most of the week. The touch bar is amazing! I don’t know why people hate it. I use it a lot of the times and find it very useful! You can unlock your MacBook with your watch as well! This laptop is perfect! It does take some getting used to if you’ve never been on mac and only windows.

"Great ultra portable, a little pricey.","I love the seamless integration and interactions it has with my Apple Watch, AirPods, and iPhone. I know people who don't have more than one Apple device hear all the time that having more than one always works great because of the ecosystem but usually only take it at face value. I was one of those people even up until I had my Apple Watch for a while but the MacBook really hooked me in. Once you realize how everything just works you don't know how you were able to do it before. Of course there is the whole walled garden argument everyone that dislikes Apple love to talk about but in reality I don't care if this walled garden is at war the rest of the world it's the best, most simple, and seamless ecosystem for the average consumer. There is a learning curve for those that come from other operating systems like the different feel of the keyboard, shortcuts, trackpad, and overall OS. But I've only been using this device for short while and already caught on super quick. I feel like despite all these positives there is still the high price. I purchased the 512 GB model and it came to around $1400 with a sale so it might take a while for the slight buyer's remorse to go away but I feel like the more I use it the quicker I become satisfied with my purchase. My final thoughts would have to be, if you have the money to purchase this at any configuration then go for it. Simply keep in mind there is a lot that goes into the satisfaction for this product; the ecosystem which would require more apple devices, the willingness to learn a new OS, understanding the added level of security and privacy that comes with Apple devices and the use case for each individual.",Hidekel Uriarte,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on August 24, 2021",

slow if running chrome or microsoft office,"I have a 2018 macbook pro. I use it for everything from adobe software to office.  I bought the M1 as it is supposed to be the fastest, and perhaps it is, but if I am just on the internet or using microsoft word to write a paper for school. It does not outdo the Intel in my previous laptop.  I put them next to one another to test the speed on chrome.  My entire life is on chrome, so switching to safari would be a pain.  I use it at work and personal.  It is ridiculously slow compared to my old macbook.  I took it back to the store and showed them, and they replaced my laptop thinking it was a hardware issue.  No, it is still the same.  After researching, apparently this is the case with the new M1 - it does not run chrome or microsoft office efficiently.

Beware...Known defective display Apple won't replace,"I was really enjoying this computer and just after the one year mark my screen became defective. I was watching a lecture and shut my computer like normal. I came back to watch the lecture and noticed lines along the left side and bottom of my screen (see picture). I spent some time with Apple support and they kept pushing that I should have bought AppleCare. I have bought AppleCare in the past but I usually take care of my electronics so I have never had to use it. If I would have it would have been $269 and anywhere between $99 for display change or as I was quoted $299 for ""other"" damage at the Apple store. By the way, the technician tried to attribute the screen malfunction to the few pieces of dust between the display and keyboard. I was willing to even split the $600 bill they quoted me and just wanted it fixed. Apple was not accountable at all for their mistakes on this one. There is currently a class action lawsuit for this ""Display Gate"". Buyers beware of the ticking time bomb of a display.  I have been a loyal customer but I think I will be looking elsewhere for my computer needs moving forward. Are all the MacBooks bad, most likely not, but they are also not all perfect.

Pay for storage (iCloud) and no ports.,"Macs use to be quite a great computer, however, this computer tends to crash with certain programs (adobe and blender.) No ports for SD cards, or USB.

Oh yeah, also I lost numerous movies that I had purchased off of my iTunes, I contacted the iTunes customer service and no help.  Pretty much I am sad, and frustrated and constantly trying to bend around apples new rules, like not only needing memory space on the computer (which mine is not full) but my icloud is full, after only 5 or 7 months of use and they want me to pay a monthly fee to save projects even on my desktop.  So I watched a youtube video to remove icloud saving features because its pointless, and took numerous of my projects in progress and changed them. So now I changed it back and it rearranged my whole desktop order and I can not save any video files on this computer or any other project on my desktop.

I iike how small it is, easy for me to carry around and much more portable than my old MacBook Pro 13 inch from like 2012. One of the major benefits of this laptop is the battery life. It lasts forever, I can go a few days without charging it where as with my 2012 laptop I have to have It plugged in all the time. I use the charger so infrequently that I lost it and had to order a new one. I love the Touch ID feature, it really makes it fun to log into my computer. The keyboard is a breeze to type on, and I am using it to fill out this review now. Five stars!",Asihley Adres,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 31, 2022",

Stick with the Intel-based Mac for now...,"I really wanted to love this laptop. I've had only Macs for years. This was supposed to be an upgrade from my 2014 MacBook Air. I previously had a 2020 16"" intel based MacBook Pro for work configured with two HP monitors. No issues with the monitors and connected instantly with zero effort to get the screens to work with the laptop. Bought this one and connected to my Belkin hub for the HDMIs. Would only connect a single monitor. Googled the issue and found that the new M1 apple chip only supports a single monitor. News to me and I guess I should have researched more. However the low rating stems from the fact that this is a PRO laptop. A professional would want two monitors and should not have to google whether a PRO laptop supports more than 1 monitor when the intel version does seamlessly. Despite this I had planned to keep it and just deal with 1 monitor because of the cost savings over buying the Intel based MacBook Pro and wanted the longer battery life. Now brings me to the issue that made me return the laptop. This laptop just would not configure to show a clear resolution with my monitors. The scale was off and the display just stayed blurry no matter what setting I changed it to on the monitor or the laptop's settings. Tried and tried and just gave up. Returned this and ordered an Intel based 13"" MacBook Pro. No issues, supports dual monitors, and seamlessly integrated to the laptop. No blurry screen and no having to set or change any settings to get it to work. I am floored that Apple would produce a Pro for business that only supports a single monitor. I love Apple but will not buy anything with their chip until the kinks are worked out.",mkidwel2,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 5, 2021",44 people found this helpful

DO NOT BUY,"We purchased this computer for our daughter for college. Six months later, she opened the computer to a black screen with colored stripes on a third of it.

She took it back to the Apple store-it costs $600 to fix it, but they’ll give us 50% off. Thanks, but $300 is still ridiculous to pay for a very obvious Apple manufacturing issue. I contacted Apple and they gave me the same response. “You don’t have insurance so there’s nothing we can do.”Her 3 other roommates have the same MacBook Pro-3 of the 4 have had the same issue with computers bought within weeks of each other.

Saw these new Pros in person from time to time, thought they were nice but just wasn't as serious about them in the past. However, I bought this and have been very happy with my purchase. This is so sleek and lightweight. My old Pro was heavy and kinda uncomfortable when I watch videos on my chest in my room relaxing. This is like the Air but better. I even got a $200 discount when I purchased 512 GB. Not sure if it was something from Amazon or manufacturer discount but it was only applied if I got the 512 GB so why not.

"New Macbook Pro Broke, and Broke further under AppleCare","I bought this laptop in late January. By May, the display was suddenly filled with random lines and blocks. The Genius Bar assistant ran a test, found the laptop had no scratches, and promised that only the top case and display would be changed. Despite my skepticism about the quality behind the Macbook Pro M1 that only lasted 4 months of usage, I accepted the repair. One week later, I went back to the Apple store and casually checked the repaired laptop’s case. There were scratches around the top case logo. There was a dent on the bottom case edge. After I brought up these issue, the Genius Bar assistant became nervous and tried to run a diagnosis test. He couldn’t because one of the USB C port was broken. After checking the only other USB C port, the battery was entirely drained and failed the diagnosis test. The cost of the AppleCare repair was quoted $500, but the damages it caused was probably close to $1000 if not more. I bought a brand new $1400 Macbook Pro that in a few months, had turned into a beaten, refurbished product through AppleCare.",Pippi,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on June 2, 2021",5 people found this helpful

Best MacBook Pro ever - for a lot of reasons,"M1 pro chip is super powerful - photo/video editing, graphic design - this thing just kills it. Compared to previous MacBook Pro, it's a giant leap ahead. These tasks are a main reason to buy the pro version of the Macbook. This particularly model is the lower end of the spec you can get for a pro,  but it still kicks butt. You can get the Pro Max chip and bump up the RAM to 64GB if you want - and add tons more storage. The 14 inch MacBook pro is the perfect size for a balance of portability and power. It can do pretty much everything the 16 inch version does. The display is stunning. Just gorgeous. 120hz capability (pro motion) gets rid of blur when scrolling and makes for clearer action when viewing movies. The brightness and black levels on the display are awesome. Real HDR viewing -  a big difference. You will hear about ""the notch"" at the top of the screen where the camera is. After 10 minutes I don't even notice it. It means nothing for your experience. Its just something critics have chosen to harp about. in most apps the notch is no even visible. Camera is now a full 1080p and is a big upgrade over previous MacBooks. Six speaker sound system with new woofers - sounds incredible. Music/movies it feels like surround sound. For video conferencing the microphones are studio quality and you can tell - this is great for video conferencing. The keyboard is a dream to type on. Very solid like all MacBooks, no spongy feel you get with so many other laptops. The Apple Magic Keyboard is the best - as is the track pad. Battery life is amazing. I have gone all day on battery without needing to plug in. At best its spec says 17 hours, which is crazy! Especially for this spec...but for real world use with a mix of tasks, it won't be 17 hours but I did a 9 hour session yesterday, and still had a ton of battery left. The power efficiency is ground breaking. They have added back the MagSafe power plug - which is great! And added back an SD card slot and and an HDMI port - which many of us hated the previous macs that deleted these ports. I wish it had at least one USB-A old style port - but it doesn't. You get three USB-C thunderbolt 4 ports that you can use with adapters if needed. They got rid of the touch screen bar at the top of the keyboard from previous pro MacBooks and put back the regular mechanical keys for the controls. Apparently they listened to a lot of users who didn't really like the touch pad. The shape and style of this laptop is great. Some say the edge of the laptop looks ""sharp"" where your wrists rest. That is BS. I have been typing most of the day and I don't feel any issue with the edge of the laptop at all. Very comfy for typing. Some haters may try to find reasons to bash this new Macbook Pro, but I am telling you - from any perspective, all brand bias aside -  this is an amazing laptop - the best Apple has ever made, hands down. And I would say you won't find a better power laptop anywhere.  All that said - this is not a gamers machine. Apple is not for hard core gamers. I mean you can play games on it that you get from the app store. I am a hard core gamer and a PC geek  - I have a powerful windows PC for gaming. And always will. But for everything else. this MacBook is king. I use to for music, for photo and video editing, for productivity. I can plut into a giant monitor if I want a bigger screen - it works great on my 34 inch IPS panel. So if you are wondering if this Macbook 14 inch pro is the real deal or not - I am here to tell you, its the real deal. I finally upgraded from my 2015 MacBook pro because this new one hits so many sweet spots - revolutionary power and battery life, excellent ergonomic design, great sound, stunning display - its the whole package. If you are thinking of getting one - you won't be disappointed. One last comment. I am an old timer windows guy, and I know all the counter arguments for the Mac. Many wills say this is overpriced compared to a windows laptop with similar spec. First, show me an intel based laptop that can match these new M1 Pro chips - you can't. And aside from that, the Mac OS is secure and stable - rock solid - and is intuitive with amazing features - like the ability to copy and paste text FROM A PHOTO! Whaaat? And the design/ergonomics/quality of these MacBooks is unmatched. So, yes you pay more - but you get more. My last MacBook pro lasted me almost 7 years and it still works great. If you want this laptop - get it! It rocks.",Jake,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 28, 2021",347 people found this helpful
The perfect laptop,"This is the perfect laptop for so many use cases. I use a lot of content creating apps and websites and this machine has not gotten hot once! Really one of the best purchases I've made especially in the computer space. I usually keep laptops for 6+ years and I do not see that changing with this one. However, there are a couple of drawbacks, if you need MS Access then you will need to use an emulator to run Windows on the laptop (Parallels does an awesome job of that) and some web file hosting applications still don't work for M1 laptops like Box. So if Box is your file hosting solution in the office, it is not yet supported but they claim to be working on it.",Shakola,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on May 6, 2022",5 people found this helpful

The Best Laptop I have Owned,"For the past 11 years, I have always had both a desktop and laptop.  I always swore that I would never purchase a Mac because Apple did not allow the user to upgrade the computer.  I usually upgrade my laptop each year and desktop every other year.  Well, after viewing numerous YouTube reviews of the M1 Macs, I purchased the MacBook Air. I absolutely loved it and it was so fast.  I would turn on my Window's laptop and the MacBook Air and it seemed that the macBook was faster than my Windows laptop.  Well, after using a Mac for most of the past year, I have moved to using it daily.  This laptop is very fast and powerful.

How Apple treats loyal customers,"I have a Mabook Pro covered by Apple care. The computer needs a new battery. To make a long story short Apple left me for months with a computer, again under warranty, which I can use for a couple of hours for simple tasks like web browsing before it needs to be recharged. Apple refused to replace the battery because the diagnostic read 81% not below 80 % as per policy. In all this Apple didn’t have any problems asking me to invest countless hours of my time between doing clean installs trips to apple stores etc.. I feel a more respectful way to treat me as a loyal customer could have been let us replace the battery first and if that doesn’t fix the issue which I seriously doubt ask me to do troubleshooting.

The Best just got better,"I was on the fence replacing my late 2011 15 inch specced out (for the time) MacBook Pro retina. Sure I almost never used the cd/DVD slot or appreciate its hefty weight or its ploddingly slow HDD. But even though this seemed like a great piece of kit, I just couldn't justify $2k plus tax. So when Amazon decided to drop $500 off the retail price I've used my $450 in Amazon gift card balance and bought this bad boy for around $1,250 with tax included.

I'm in love all over again!,"Let me start by saying I'm an Apple user all the way, iphone, ipads, and my last former PC was an 8 year old Macbook Air 13, mid-2013, 1.5GHZ dual-core Intel i5, 4GB RAM, 128GB Flash drive. That laptop still today is in great working order for what it is, I find that quite amazing since most of the PC products of recent are junk, designed to last less than one year. You may think me biased, but I'm not, just read the competitor's reviews for yourself which I did extensively before buying my next Macbook Pro. I used to be a Windows user, and still am, but not on a Windows based system with Intel silicon. Those systems are unstable, more hackable, and the hardware that is made even from manufacturers like HP today do not live up to the standards they lived up to in the past. Reading most of the different Apple product reviews, the biggest complaint was price. Well, the old adage still applies, you basically get what you pay for and I was thrilled to wait it out for their September event when I saw this going for $400 off at $1599!. Regarding all the hyperbole about the notch, I honestly do not know it is even there. As far as this new Macbook Pro 14"" is concerned, well I cannot express how beautiful this laptop is. The display and sound are to die for, the speed of the m1 silicon is amazing. Yes, it's a little heavier than my previous Macbook Air 13, but the body of the Pro is actually a smaller footprint than it's predecessor, but with a larger display!

Love and missed Mac!,"Love this computer!  I’m a graphic designer so I need the power for all the Adobe programs. I had a pc for several years (switched from being a dedicated Mac user) only to save money at the time. The pc was ok but it was getting a bit old and I couldn’t keep multiple Adobe programs open.  Macs are so user friendly, and there are no speed issues whatsoever.  It’s hard to not appreciate so the ingenuity that goes into them. So happy I switched back!!!  Also I got the 14 inch, would have loved the 16, but I connect to an extra monitor, so it’s all good. Actually, The height of this screen is the same as my 17 inch pc!  It’s about an inch and a half less in width but it doesn’t feel too small to me.",Chica!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on July 6, 2022",19 people found this helpful

Well Made-Outstanding Display (Wallet emptying),"I'm not a video content user, or do any heavy video editing that may tax the processor or GPU. I'm more a casual user, so the full power and potential features of this laptop will never be used by me. So why would I spend a whopping $2,500 on a 16-inch laptop? Two reasons, my old 2012 MacBook Pro has reached obsolesce and after December 2021 Apple will no longer support it (no more security updates). Secondly, I am heavily into the Apple ecosystem. iPad, iPhone, iMac and I really like how all my devices work together seamlessly. Also, I'm an older guy (euphemism for senior citizen) and I really like and prefer a larger screen size on my laptop as opposed to portability. Having got all that out of the way, let me share this, this laptop is AMAZING. The screen display is incredibly sharp with vivid colors. It has a comfortable keyboard with good backlighting. The very large glass track pad is very responsive, and Apple's software is excellent at palm rejection, so your resting hands do not interfere when your typing. The sound output through the speakers is very, very impressive, almost unbelievable for laptop. The laptop's aluminum frame is solid. It is a big, bulky laptop, so if you're on the go and looking for a laptop to lug around everyday, I recommend you look at the 13-inch Mac laptops. Buying a laptop at this price range is a huge investment and I recommend that potential buyers do their due diligence and compare features and costs of both Macs and Windows PCs, especially if you're not in the Apple ecosystem. But, If, however you want a larger 16-inch screen and a Mac laptop then your choices will be the 2020 (Intel) or 2021 MacBook Pro (M1 Pro) and of the two, I recommend the M1 Pro version. Once I got over the sticker shock, I really am very happy with my 2021 MacBook. My recommendation?

Expensive and unreliable,"My last MacBook lasted over 7 years and really still works, just needed to upgrade. Got the new MacBook 16” 1tb. A few months in, it just randomly dies. Dead. Suuuuper dead. I walked away to the kitchen for a snack and when I came back it was off and wouldn’t turn back on. No storm or power surge, just random computer death. I several days worth of work, and Apple never could explain what happened, but replaced it for free.  Now a year later the screen cracked and went black as I tilted it back with my fingers during a zoom meeting. I didn’t crank on it or anything weird, just a normal tilt. Back to Apple, but this time I’m outside their warranty. Their only explanation is that I applied too much pressure with my non dominant hand fingers during a work video conference. In 25 years I’ve never cracked a screen but somehow today I applied too much pressure.  It’s going to cost almost $700 to repair. I thought this would be apples latest and greatest but is apparently a lemon. I used to be such an Apple advocate because their quality was so good but apparently those days are gone.

Disappointed!!,Out of the box unusable for me. This MacBook Pro does not have any USB ports to be able to restore from a previous Mac back up that’s on an external drive. You must buy an adapter. Since I live in a remote area I’d have to order online and wait. You cannot even plug a iPhone12 Pro Max directly into it. The only ports it has are thunderbolt. So even Apple’s own lighting connector needs an adapter. The keyboard is a downgrade from the old keyboard. Solid black plastic instead of plastic keys surrounded by aluminum which were easier to see. Had to call Apple support to download an update because there is no reset option in the System Preferences of OS Monterey. And the update did not work to give it that option. Will have to figure out a different option to remove my account and information to return it.

Dead on arrival!,I ordered the 2021 16 inch right away as I knew they would probably sell out fast. I had to make sure I had one for my trip I am leaving on soon.  As soon as I opened it the screen would never come on.  Thought maybe it needed charging so I tried that.  Still nothing but a black screen.  It kept making the sound when you open it up even when it was closed over and over again.  I took it to the local Apple Store hoping I could get some answers.  They tired to get it to work and could not either.  They said it is very strange and maybe something happened to it during shipping.  They said since it is brand new it would be best to get my money back from Amazon.  I thought maybe I could just exchange it before my trip but the one I ordered is out of stock.  I will try the 14 inch and see if I like it compared to the size of the 16 inch since it is in stock.

Very pleased (so far!),"I was a bit concerned about the fact that Apple has moved away from Intel and is now producing their own M1 processor but I have to say it is incredibly fast. My company provides me with my computer of choice for work and in 2020 I received a top of the line MacBook Pro with an Intel 8 core i9 processor and 64GB of memory and 4TB SSD that retailed for close to $5,000 and I have to say this new MacBook pro with the 10 core M1, 16 core GPU, 1TB SSD and only 16GB of memory at almost half that price seems much faster. The display is just stunning. The graphics quality is among the best I've seen and video performance is flawless. it's everything a MacBook pro should be. High performance in a sleek aluminum case. A couple of things to note if you are not familiar with this computer and thinking of buying one. It only comes with 3 USB-C / Thunderbolt 3 interfaces. So you are going to need adapters if you plan on using any wired peripheral devices like keyboard, mouse, external drives etc.. that have standard USB interfaces. And at a minimum you should be backing your system up to an external drive. So, I’d recommend buying a USB-C to USB hub as I'm not big on adapters. There's several here on Amazon in the $20-30 range. Also, like most other manufacturers, Apple has dropped the DVD/CD. It's not even an option. If burning DVDs and CDs is still a thing for you, again you can connect an external device with a hub or adapter. I'd also recommend buying a cooling tray, especially if you are going to leave this computer on a desk powered up perpetually or for long periods of time so you can protect the CPU and more importantly the GPU from heat. Lastly, a few words on MacOS Montery that shipped with this computer. The most recent OS I was using was Sierra on my MBP 2013 and the learning curve was not difficult at all. My only complaint is Monterey turns on a lot of stuff I don't need or even want. For example, as soon as I signed in with my Apple ID to sync my music from iCloud, I started getting texts, Facetime and even phone calls for my entire family on my computer. We use the same Apple ID for all our devices for a number of reasons and while it wasn't too difficult to disable, I'd rather Apple leave that up to the user.  I'll post an update more geared toward the performance and reliability of this system as time goes by but for now, I have to say I'm very pleased and would highly recommend this new MacBook Pro. One final comment on the purchase process. I actually ordered one directly from Apple. I live about 60 miles from an Apple store and wanted it shipped to me. I was given a projected ship date about 3 weeks after placing my order. After waiting almost the full 3 weeks, my order was still processing and hadn't moved toward the preparing to ship status. I then realized Apple has a store here on Amazon, they had exactly what I wanted in stock. So after canceling my order with Apple, I bought my computer here on Amazon and it arrived in 2 days.",Hypercussion,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 10, 2022",101 people found this helpful

When I went to check the order status on Amazon, I saw that the driver put my last name on the signature line. Luckily, it was not stolen otherwise I’d be trying to get reimbursement from Amazon right now.",anthony,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on May 25, 2022",3 people found this helpful

You get the dual 35w charger with this and it charged mine from 50% to full in less than 45 mins while using it. The magnet charging cable is braided and color coded with a light indicator while charging. I am shocked how fast this machine moves and what quality the hidden speakers are. Phone calls and FaceTime are flawless. The new web cam is a welcome upgrade and the notch for it is subtle. The trackpad and keyboard are top notch and respond perfectly. This is worth every penny. I went with silver since that new midnight color is prone to scuffs and scratches showing. No fingerprints show on this silver and it’s a very classic look. If you’re on the fence go for it.

Amazing battery life backed up by an amazing hardware experience,"I got the base 256GB 8GB of ram model and this thing does everything I need it to and more. I consider myself fairly tech savvy, so when I heard all the controversy surrounding this model and its slower SSD, I was a little hesitant. After realizing what I wanted to do with the computer, this become a non-factor. I mostly do school (computer science) a little bit of rendering for my 3d printer and some very light gaming. The SSD has never been an issue in my day to day. If you are editing photos or access large files that will need to be read or written to often, maybe go to the 512GB model to get the faster SSD. If you are not working in CAD or video/photo editing all the time you will not care I promise. The rest of this machine has astounded me. 18 hours of battery life is not just marketing, the speed of the M2 is snappy and can handle much more than I thought it would. The new screen is gorgeous. Trackpad is the best on the market bar none. The keyboard is the best keyboard I have ever felt on a laptop and is an absolute joy to type on. MagSafe is back and amazing as before. Probably my favorite thing about this laptop, coming from a Windows gaming laptop is the lack of a fan. You will lose a little performance, but not having that noise is absolutely astounding.

No more wasted screens space! I love this laptop.,"I absolutely love this laptop. I was definitely overdue for a new laptop but was holding off because-who wants to purchase a new laptop? I upgraded from the Macbook Pro I believe the 2017 version and that one was definitely running really slow.  I run a decent amount of programs on the computer including video editing software and the new MacBook Air can handle it just fine.  The screen is so large I absolutely love it.  There is no more wasted space at the menu bar at the top of the page which creates so much more space.  Also, the keys on the keyboard seem to be spaced out a bit more so typing is much easier than on my iPad keyboard or even the older MacBook pro keyboard.  I am very happy with the purchase. I purchased the skylight option which is outside of my comfort level as I would normally go with a space grey color but I am really happy with the choice.

Amazon mailed an empty MacBook box,"I was incredibly excited to receive the very expensive computer that I ordered. However, the MacBook Air wasn’t delivered on the guaranteed day. It was late. The “24/7” location that it was shipped to for pickup wasn’t actually 24/7. It was more like 2/7. And it was a two mile walk from where my boat was docked. So, after several long walks, I finally was able to access the Amazon locker. Lo and behold, there was a suuuuuuuper light box awaiting me. Wow, I thought, this computer IS really light. I excitedly dove into the packaging. Layer by layer. Until I finally reached the glowing apple box. I giddily opened the box expecting to find my first ever MacBook Air… and I was greeted by only the air… no MacBook. Just air. An empty empty box.

Ready to lose all compatibility with older macs/ext SSD/SDmemory!

They are also not yet supported by most popular printer companies ... no Epson printer drivers for 2 years now! My only guess is that apple wants all customers to use icloud drives online with no other easy options!  Maybe they will make printing an apple service too?  This is a deal breaker for me ...

Edit: changed original review,"This doesn't have windows 11.  It's windows 10 s mode and the upgrade to windows 11 is free. the option takes hrs to come up. Basically go through set up.  After 3 hrs or so of restarting and downloading it will upgrade to a new version of 10, then that version takes time to register it meets the requirements. The Microsoft app that reads your system... Gpu, memory, etc helps.  It's PC health checkup or something like that.  But you get it in s mode so it's from Microsoft.  It will help Microsoft's site recognize the computer can handle windows 11 and then eventually it will give the option.  I put 4 hrs into setup. Went to bed leaving it plugged in and letting it update on its own.  Basically choose the fastest update option.  The one that lets the machine restart on its own.... Let that happen over night and then by morning the option will be there and after another 2 hrs.... You are in.  Besides the long wait the computer is actually great... I'll update more after I install this memory.",David Stone,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 16, 2022",76 people found this helpful
So Far So Good!,"I was a little nervous about purchasing this at first from reading some reviews. I've had it a few days now and it's been working great! So, as many mentioned, it does have Windows 10 S mode when you first open it. However, the upgrade to 11 was free. I can see how some people could be frustrated by this and not understand how to do it. After set up, I went to windows update and made sure all updates were installed. You don't have to wait hours for the install to pop up. After installing updates, I went to system, which you can find in settings, and product key and activation. From there I was able to activate Windows 11 Home. Hope this helps. So far a wonderful laptop.",Jess,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on August 4, 2022",35 people found this helpful

Be aware if you order this laptop it is shipped with Windows 11 S which is safe mode.,"It took me 3-4 hours to get a new printer on my home network because of Windows 11 S. The folks at Canon were very helpful but ultimately I had to turn it over to Microsoft to setup Windows 11. Windows 11 S will only allow you to add Microsoft Apps and doesn't allow networking. I really like the Lenovo laptop but this should be a toggle to switch out of Safe mode. Microsoft prefers you use only their apps in order to avoid potential pitfalls with generic apps. Also this laptop does not have a CD/DVD Drive.

The availability of info to clear this up was not good, I finally got in touch with Microsoft and they rectified the problem.

This is a great little machine for travel and outdoor activities!,"I am a longtime user of Windows laptops, Android phones, and Amazon Fire tablets. In the planning stages of an international vacation, I decided that I did not want to take a large laptop, nor did I want to use only a phone or tablet for web browsing and communications. This small, ruggedized, and relatively inexpensive Chromebook seemed like the perfect solution for my travel needs, which fall mostly into the categories of casual web browsing for travel and weather information, and the use of Google apps (maps, email, online voice and video comms, file storage). Getting it running was extremely easy, and Wi-Fi and processing power seem perfectly adequate for my needs. Storage is sufficient to accommodate pdf versions of my travel guides and maps for offline use. The charger will work internationally with an inexpensive adapter, and will fast charge our phones as well. This has been a great tech experience with no regrets so far.

Desktop level performance,Best gaming laptop for the money. This computer is an amazing value even with GPU prices dropping. This thing is more powerful as most desktops (14 cores!). Still very portable and useable for everyday things like work editing and gaming on the go. The only complaint I have is the battery life. Between the i9 CPU and the 125w 3070ti GPU this thing wont not last long when not plugged in. IMO it also look's a lot better once I had it in person compared to what I was expecting.

better can be had for the money,"This is about the right price wise for this laptop but better can be easily had. I almost bought this but fortunately decided to google the model i7 that's in this and it's a wimp of an i7. only 4 cores...... the laptop I went with was the exact same price with the same graphics card, 16gb of ram, RGB keyboard and an eight core i7-11800H which leaves this laptop in the dust. The laptop I am referencing is the 17.3"" Gateway Creator series laptop sold exclusively by Walmart. Sure, it's not built to military specs but I'm not in the military or taking this laptop to a literal battlefield..... I hope. this Asus laptop has too many drawbacks... limited upgradability, no webcam, no RGB keyboard. soldered on 8gb of ram leaving only one ram slot for upgrades, PCIE 3.0. The Gateway has much more upgradability options, a webcam, RGB keyboard, dual ram slots with a max of 64gb, and PCIE gen4 m.2 slots. the only thing the gateway lacks is the build quality and thunderbolt. the gateway has USB-C.",Amazonoholic,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on April 14, 2022",

If you have the coin go with the RTX 3060 or 3070 option, however I highly recommend you upgrade the RAM and NvMe drive either way.

Initially, it had a myriad of updates necessary. Once these were finished the machine was much quicker to start up and performance overall was a lot better. My only complaint is it's cost when considering the inferior RTX3050TI that it comes with. I almost got this machine for $850, but I waited until later that day to make my decision, and by then the price jumped  $100. That changed it from a great deal to an okay deal in my opinion.

Great upgrade,"For roughly the same price I paid for a gaming laptop with a gtx1050, it’s a major upgrade for me. It looks very professional and not too over the top with gamer aesthetics. The screen is great on my unit, especially with the thin bezels thought it does have a noticeable chin with the asus logo. I got the lower tier with the 500 GB SSD so that I later on upgrade the space with a terabyte. Overall, not a bad buy. Though I will note, there’s already soldered ram inside and only one slot of space for another stick of ram so keep that in mind when your upgrading your ram. Another thing is that it doesn’t have a webcam, you may not want to use this for zoom calls unless you’ll want to invest in a webcam yourself.",Leo,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 1, 2022",

Runs very HOT,"Bought this as a portable option for light gaming, but I am fearful to use it for anything more than basic web browsing and video playback. This laptop will thermal throttle on the CPU after less than 30 seconds of running a game. It will constantly run at 95C+ while running a game or doing anything that's CPU demanding. The GPU stays cool compared to the CPU and typically only hits temps in the 65-75C range. I've tried every option I can find to help the CPU run cooler, but nothing seems to help. What makes this even worse is that the fans don't spin up to a high rate to cool the CPU until it is already 95-100C+ and then they only run until the CPU falls below that temp. The fans do get somewhat loud, but I'd take that over the overheating if they'd actually run more often to keep the CPU cool and not just spin up to cool it after it already thermal throttles. Other than the heat and lack of fans doing anything (using any of the modes available), the laptop seems good so far.",Grumpy Spud,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on July 21, 2022",

"Too many problems that make it almost impossible to use at times, especially for college","I would really like to like this computer, but I just can't. It has a few small problems that are just a hassle, but its big problems make it awful. For small problems, its screen does a complete reset when you plug and unplug the charger, which isn't the end of the world but is just another problem to add to the list. Secondly, the fans will just turn up to max speed, randomly for no apparent reason. It is very loud and disruptive, especially when you are in a college class. They also won't turn off when you close the computer, you have to do a complete shutdown and restart to get the problem to go away. Thirdly, the battery does not last as long as they say it does and dies at about half the time that is listed. Fourthly, not only does the laptop die fast, but when it gets to a low battery it crawls down to a snail's pace and is basically impossible to use. When it gets to 15% you might as well just give up on trying to do anything on it. It will not even run candy crush because it goes down to an fps of 2 when you open it. Lastly, and in my opinion, most importantly, it will randomly crash to a blue screen error and you will lose all of the windows that you had open and progress you do not have saved. I do not recommend this laptop to anyone and would recommend you avoid it at all costs.",Mary,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on November 26, 2021",8 people found this helpful

Solid laptop that mixes productivity and gaming.,"This laptop is for someone who wants a laptop to take around and do productive work on and also play modern games at high settings. There are others with faster GPUS, but hardly any that can claim 6-9 hours of battery life like this one. There are tons of battery saving features, like a dedicated key to change what power profile to use. The 144hz screen auto sets to 60hz on battery so save battery life. Gaming on a AAA game at high settings, 30 fps, I get around 2-3 hours of battery life. Less demanding games can go more. Other contemporary laptops i've used can really only game for an hour or so while on battery. You can also set the battery life to be capped at 80% or 60% to extend it's usable life. I usually keep it on 80% and still have long battery life.

High Quality product. For the passionates,I've always been a big fan of Asus. When i dived in to the market for a gaming laptop and looked at other Asus products found out that their pricing is pretty high (probably justified but still high). Weeks of searching later found this and even though i was a little skeptical cause of the 4 core cpu i decided to get this and let me tell you I don't regret. The nvdia 3050i should indeed pair with 6 or 8 core cpu's but for the price it still Ed oes a great job. It may not be super future proof but it's still giving me great performance on most games that came up until 2021. Paired with the Xbox game pass for PC this machine is a solid purchase. Fan is not crazy loud and battery life is excellent. Screen and Trackpad are just fine but you're getting more than you paid for.

Refurb: Juan/Amazon dropped the ball here.,"Mine was a refurb unit, clearly not refurbed. It was not working upon opening machine. Because I am an IT nerd I instantly took it apart. Which I quickly found was done previously. Took me a bit but I found that the power button ribbon cable appeared RIPPED out its plug. Ez fix, but when it came back on the original owners (Juan) account was on the drive… oh boy thats a security issue but Im a good guy Ill just wipe it and fresh install the OS. Timejump to 4am me about to strangle this thing From the bitlocked profile unable to let me turn off safeboot for reimaging to the real difficult back plate removal. If you want to wipe it you gotta turn off a bios setting with no description. VRM or something. Or else OS install wont see the drive. No sleep that night but its now working. I hope the ripped out ribbon cable/plug stays in place and isnt damaged or thats the first thing to go.

Not as good as you might think,"Only has 3 USB slots. Not 4. Only has 1 RAM slot, be aware of this if upgrading. Has 8 gb of RAM integrated so there will be no RAM to remove when upgrading. The CPU and GPU seem to run very high on most games I have tested. CPU being the bottleneck here. CPU running at 60-100% during most of the games I play. Decent little machine, but I expected more from this i7 to be honest. Also I would suggest getting a laptop cooling pad  to extend the life of the machine, as it heats up quickly during those high % usages even with the fan in performance or turbo mode. When running on battery power I have noticed reduced performance and lag in many windows applications, and even wifi stuttering. Immediately returns to normal performance once plugged back in to the AC adapter.",T.S. Day,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 3, 2022",

Laptop works great for basic live streaming.,"My old laptop was struggling to keep up with all the live streaming software so I decided to get a new one. I guess since gaming and video rendering need a good graphics card, I found this laptop to be very affordable for performance and durability. I've had this laptop for about a month now. Since I've had this laptop, it runs all my software without a problem. Software: OBS, iVCam, PowerPoint, MyPoint, Touch Portal. The fan is always silent in performance mode and the connection to YouTube is always excellent. There is a slight high-pitched (probably electrical) noise when I turn on the laptop. Most probably won't recognize this except with those with extremely sensitive ears. The upgradability of this laptop is a plus. And I'm still learning how to use the laptop's software to provide a better sound for music. But the software is there. As with the other aspects of this laptop, there is a fair amount of software to help with customizing your laptop performance to get the most out of it. But not too much customization in that I was able to my live stream software up and running rather quickly.

Awesome Laptop,"This laptop is an absolute unit. The downside to this is the RAM is extremely small for such a high GPU. Good news is, there is a 32gb card available that takes little to no skill or computer experience at all to install. After updating the RAM I was able to run any and all games at the absolute highest settings while still keeping above 60fps. The only other draw backs I would say this laptop has is the small amount of memory in the standard SSD and its ability to cool itself. The SSD issue can be fixed by purchasing a larger SSD and has an additional slot for this so there is  no removing of old parts, just the addition of a new card. (all installation information and compatible parts can be found throughout Youtube.) The cooling issue was also an easy fix and could be done with another purchase of a cooling mat for any laptop.

Buena maquina,"Es una buena laptop, con excelente calidad precio-beneficio. La calidad de materiales y ensamble es correcto (no es un PC premium, pero no se espera que lo sea por ese precio); su rendimiento es muy bueno, corre lo que sea. La temperatura del procesador y la grafica es muy buena cuando juegas; por ejemplo, warzone en graficos altos, no pasa de 78°, al menos que haya una actualización en segundo plano o que Defender este chequeando el PC.  Sin embargo, para mantener estas temperaturas se debe tener una base o almuhadilla refrigerante. Para las tareas diarias, es mas que suficiente; con la APP Armory Create (es una excelente APP de Asus para gestionar el poder del PC), puedes activar el modo eco de la GPU cuando no necesites tareas exigentes, esto desactiva la tarjeta grafica dedicada y el PC se mantiene muy fresco para trabajo suave con temperaturas entre los 45 - 50° sin necesidad de base refrigerante, trabajando además de forma muy silenciosa lo que se agradece en la oficina o en la Universidad. La calidad de la camara no es muy buena, pero realmente casi no la uso. Cuando usas toda la potencia de PC, los ventiladores suenan bastante fuerte, pero en esos casos generalmente uso audifonos, así que no me molesta.

It's Legit But Gets Super Hot,"All specs check out. The temperature on this thing averages over 80 degrees, which means this thing isn't built to last. It is very powerful and plays everything at 60 fps on Ultra, but it gets really hot (gets close to 100 degrees when gaming). I have a laptop fan running on high underneath this laptop and it still gets really hot. I even use it next to a portable ac blowing into it. Nothing helps keep it cool. In essence, yes, it's powerful, but trying to keep this thing under 80 degrees is a huge problem that will result in parts failure within a year; heck, even within 6 months. The battery life is terrible (2 hours on average). When you plug it in, that's when you have full power of the GPU or graphics card. When unplugged (using battery), the gpu runs half powered and is cooler, but with a 2 hour battery life, you have to constantly plug it in to use it. Most laptops I've owned have lasted over 2 years, but this particular one doesn't seem likely to even make it to a year with its heating issues.

Great mix of portability & performance!,"I've been a long-time ASUS fan. I've got a self-built desktop that uses numerous ASUS components, and have used their laptops in the past (my family business also bought a couple Vivobooks). The designs are usually top notch & well built. This one has a solid LCD housing without too-much flex. The battery life is reasonable for this system; the ""silent"" mode keeps things quiet & cool for non-gaming and non-video/audio production tasks. ""Performance"" mode (predictably) runs the battery down quickly but this mode is best used when connected to a power outlet. The fans are a little loud under heavy loads, but that's also to be expected in such a slim chassis. The speakers are competent but not stellar. The display has a great refresh rate & good viewing angles. I think the i7-12650H model was the right choice as it still gives you all 6 Performance Cores compared to the 12700H, you're losing 4 E-cores but as a mostly stationary/occasionally portable gaming system it's not really a loss. The TB4 & multiple USB ports (that don't block each other by being too close) are all USB 3 & up, no USB 2 here. My model has an SK Hynix Gold P31 SSD (512GB) & I'm plenty happy with that performance. I'll but putting in a second NVMe drive later since the slot on the board is open. Keyboard is good, the touchpad has an excellent feel & spacious.",Greg J.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on July 23, 2022",44 people found this helpful

Settings like dlss and Ray tracing won't work at 1440p, but at the main screen's 1080p those settings work fine. Coding with Unity and Roblox is extremely fast. Docking this laptop through usb-c will lower performance due to power constraints, but not enough to inhibit gaming or coding. I've found the newer Dell docking stations work best.

Just awesome for the money!  Read for a few important details...,"UPDATE: For anyone who doubted that the mobo in the 2022 version of this laptop supported Gen 4 SSD's, you can put those doubts to rest. I received, installed and tested the 1tb Gen 4 Micron 3400 series SSD that I ordered. The drive is rated to achieve 6600 read and 5000 write.  Chrystal Disk tests mine out at 6545.55 read and 4934.03 write.  The only way that I could realize the top speeds of my new Micron Gen 4 SSD is if the Mobo supported Gen 4 SSD's.  So there you have it. Just be aware that a Gen 4 SSD in a Gen 4 mobo will run hotter than a Gen 3 SSD in a Gen 4 mobo.  To make matters a bit worse, there isnt a lot of room inside this laptop for air flow.  This may be why the manufacturer of the 2022 version used a Gen 3 SSD instead of a Gen 4 SSD.  This is by no means an insurmountable problem.  Just make sure that you shop for a decent M.2 SSD heat sink at the same time that you're shopping for that new ultra fast Gen 4 SSD. Ive used a 1mm thick graphene coated copper plate, on top of a 1mm thick silicone pad on top of a 0.07mm thick layer of graphene tape.

ARK is specifically the game I was trying to run, but even World of Warcraft is now running on the chips integrated graphics rather than the GPU!

its a fine basic laptop - lacks in many areas,"i got this on prime day for about $300 delivered and had a good feel for what i was buying, a bit disappointed with overall performance and battery. first thing i did was upgrade ram with an 8GB stick for better performance then i tuned windows 11 for better performance with fewer visuals, turned battery charge stopping point to 80% for longer battery life.  also i installed avast AV as i heard windows defender was causing performance issues - probably fixed by now",K. andersen,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on August 13, 2022",One person found this helpful

Good mixture of components for the price but needs more memory,"I deploy and setup a lot of computers for my work as I work as a consultant for small businesses taking care of their IT needs. The case is okay nothing to really write about it's functional and mostly plastic so that helps to keep the cost down in the manufacturing. I do like the layout of the components on the mainboard they placed the fan on the right side of the unit and then created an air channel by making track which guides the airflow across the CPU, over the heat pipe, and then exiting the laptop by passing through the heat sink fins. The CPU is placed over the keyboard area and not the palm rest portions of the laptop. This keeps your palms from heating up and sweating during the warm summer and fall months. Dell and HP uses to place the CPU underneath the palm rest area to keep the heat away from the  other components of the laptop but ergonomically it wasn't a good idea. The M.2 NVMe card could have been replaced with an 22x42 card instead of 22x80 and placed inside the track of the airflow for better cooling.",Avid couch surfer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on May 20, 2022",26 people found this helpful

Good cheap laptop for school/college.,"This laptop is good both in its size and weight. I would say that that everything is fine except the fact you couldn't add additional ram (4gb soldered to board) you can however add a nvme ssd to it which is a plus if you want to dual boot or have more space, also I could say the TN panel is fine for this price range not a colorful IPS display but it suffices. Just don't expect to be running to many tabs or almost any game on here I would suggest to keep it light so booting it won't be a problem for the celeron cpu inside. I use it right now for college, and probably will use it after for media consumption.

Let's just say I had to reinstall Windows S, which is better than a Chromebook, several times due to crashes/freezing from both the cheap Win10 S and hardware bits. There are, however, some more pleasant characteristics to point out: (1) you are able to and a M.2 SDD--if installed, even a cheap standard chip, you will see processing performance noticably increase which is a nice feature--so a must if you plan on purchasing this; (2) durability--for the cost, it's pretty durable more so than other laptops out there except the sticky numb keyboard--it has a terrible ""finger to key"" response rate--so upgrade that to the backlit if possible; (3) the screen and graphics are good --  you just need a better processor /hard drive to go with it; (4) delivery was the same day, so no fuss over that.

"Works great with the right Linux, with some installation finesse","4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage is not enough for Windows 10. It will install and run, but slowly and system updates will eventually eat up all your storage. 4GB of RAM is even light for some Linux distributions. But I put Xubuntu, a lightweight Linux distro, on the laptop immediately before ever booting Windows. Out of the box, wifi does not work. It requires the ""rtl8821ce"" driver, which is on Github. Without network, this required downloading the Ubuntu ""DKMS"" package, in addition to the rtl8821ce driver, onto a USB stick and then compiling and installing on the laptop. Because this laptop has secure boot, it will create a key for you and enroll it in the laptop's firmware, which must be confirmed after you reboot the machine. This sounds difficult but it's not bad.

Worst personal computer EVER-and the software's about the same.,"I have worked with computers for over 40 years, from mainframes to high-end personals, so I know how to make computers work. I ordered this little atrocity so I could spend some time upstairs with my wife, instead of my holing up all the time in the computer cavern in the basement. The little horror arrived about 5 hours ago, and I have spent all that time trying to load Word and gmail, and a few others--and that's all. The package of programs that came with it has demanded a new login and password almost with every click. Bill Gates would be horrified at what his genius has led to. Almost every click produces a new pitch for some Microsoft product. I wanted to use Firefox instead of the Microsoft equivalent, and it practically had me read ""War and Peace"" before it would let me do it and--I STILL haven't been able to do it. Cortana has a soothing voice, but if she were here, I would happily throw her into a tank of live alligators, and chortle all the way up to dinner, where I'd eat her liver with a nice Chianti. Whoever wrote the programs has about a 3rd grade level of English. As an example, one page asks if I give permission to use certain of my data. Click no or yes. It then has one box that says ""accept"". Well, if I clicked the No box, that means that I don't accept sending them data. No box for ""don't accept."" So how do I say I don't want them to use my data? The little touchscreen is wildly oversensitive, and very hard to use in a practical sense. Naturally, there are no written instructions, so you have to make it work before you can discover how to make it work.",Frankie,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 8, 2021",12 people found this helpful

"Quiet, cool, reliable.","I have always found Celeron processors to be the most reliable workhorses, and since I wanted this computer to function as a reliable little workhorse for the type of work that doesn't require 5 cores and 50gb ram, it was actually a selling point for me. The Celeron is as expected - medium speed, zero hiccups or hangups, mild exclusion from some of your fancier computing ambitions (compatibility).",penile,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on May 24, 2021",3 people found this helpful

Not bad for the money,"I like the L210 for what I use it for, after you add more storage and move the OS over to it it’s a fast little computer, I didn’t like the S mode and I bought it with windows 10 but the minute I turned it on it updated to windows 11, I personally didn’t want 11, but I had 10 put back in it that’s what I wanted in the first place. But other than that the screen isn’t bad at all, love the key board, for a cheap computer it dose what I need it to and I love the small size, the other down fall is the Ram isn’t upgradable your stuck with 4g Ram, you really need to change from 64g of storage to something bigger I put a 512g in mine and it dose have a internal slot for it and it’s easy to install and set up, even if you don’t upgrade the storage it’s still a good little computer, you won’t be able to play high end games but I don’t play games anyway, works great with Utube and FB, I would definitely recommend it for a low budget computer",bryant ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on August 20, 2022",2 people found this helpful

good for work and projects with some adjustments,"So far the L210 slim laptop is good for working on projects and would make a great investment for a highschool or college grade laptop. Had to make a couple adjustments like uninstall the graphics driver and install the intel one because graphics problems with chrome as well as in chrome disable the ""use hardware acceleration when available"" setting because of graphics errors caused. the other adjustment made was creating my own power plan because with the one that comes pre-made for it doesnt do the laptop much justice. basic power plan was 4-6 hours on battery but with a well setup plan have it setup it can do 6-10 hours with videos and 10-12 hours on everything else from browsing web to having multiple programs running. some stuff you should know is the graphics is 2gb which can handle 1080 videos easy depending on your internet speed. 4gb of ram and barely any is actually used unless you have alot of programs running at once. the processor says 1.2ghz dual core but the speeds that have been running are  1.8-4ghz so far depending on whats running. doesnt get too hot when running games or videos so wont get burns when sitting a your lap. 1 thing tho is that it is listed as having a backlit keyboard but it does not have one. After dealing with windows updates and driver updates theres around 20-25 gb left of space available so if you decide to buy one of these laptops make sure to get a micro sd card for it so you can expand the space and i recommend 120-500 gig.",thomas,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on April 22, 2021",One person found this helpful

Super impressed,"Considering the price especially, this is a freaking steal. However, if you’re spending $200 and expecting the quality of a $1000 laptop— you’re setting your own self up for disappointment. This is a wonderful choice if you’re on a budget or just need one for the basics. It’s stores things for a few of my games, college programs and work programs. It’s fast, and well worth over the asking price imo. This is actually my new fav brand too!",EHG,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on May 9, 2021",One person found this helpful

Fast enough even with 10 as long as you don't go crazy with apps and tabs open, remember no fan.  Ran an Acer Netbook this size for many years and this does way better.  It's light, less than half the weight of my Acer 15"" lappie.  VERY handy size.  Put in a Crucial 256 then installed Mint.

You get what ya pay for!,Purchased this in July & here we are end of December & the battery has completely stopped holding a charge! I realize electronics are not meant to last forever but 6months in this should NOT be an issue. Sound doesn’t go up very high from the start as well so movie/video watching is doable but not super good quality. I have since taken it into a shop for a new battery which cost 150.00. Normally I’d say forget it but being that I just bought it I figured I’d replace that part & see what life I get out of it. I have a 4 year warranty on it but of course it’s accidental damage warranty. Even the guy at the computer shop was surprised at the fact that I just purchased it & need a new battery.

Great customer service,"first one received wouldn't turn on; after a call to tech, a replacement was quickly sent!

Exactly what I wanted! So Happy!,"This is my forth day using this mini laptop. I have to say that is has totally met my expectations and more! I do my homework on anything I decide to buy, this was no different. I knew that it was going to be smaller than a typical laptop. Yes, I was expecting a 11.6""x 7.6 laptop. I measure before I purchase(; No, it isn't a touchscreen. I bought this awesome gadget because I have a teenage son that I homeschool. I wanted a small laptop that I can use while he is on our main home PC. I love the size! Totally lite and portable! I added a Samsung 256gb. micro SD card for extra memory. I chose not to install the Windows 10 H upgrade. I will be using the Windows S that it came with. I'm not doing heavy duty stuff on this laptop. I'm not gaming or using it like I would a PC. I like to research, Youtube, shop online, take some online courses, ect. My son uses the PC for school, video editing, and gaming in our home school/ craft room, while I can do my own business on this new mini laptop. I am very happy with my purchase! By the way, I did install the free year of Microsoft Office 365 Personal version. It is worth around $70. The installation was a breeze! You must set up a Microsoft account, if you don't already have one, and set up a credit card for automatic renewal for next year. The awesome part is that once you have a Microsoft account, you can use the Microsoft office on any personal computer device as long as you sign in and download the software. Remember that the free version of the software that comes with this laptop is for one person (not the Microsoft Office 365 Family), although I think they offered that for free for 9 months instead of a year(: A great deal as well because you can add up to 5 family members for that account!

I don't watch movies on my computer but it plays you tube type videos just fine.  sound is a little weak but if I want to listen to music I can cast it to my stereo.  What I like best is the size and weight. Small and light. And it seems to be built solid. I charge it at night and use it off and on all day and there is plenty of juice left.

Great laptop for a person on the go.,"I bought this laptop to replace my previous ASUS laptop which had served me well for eight years. They make a quality product and I trust this manufacturer. I use it for work and I have to travel from room to room in my building. (I'm a substitute teacher) its small size and light weight make it ideal. The battery life is great too, a big improvement. It gets 15 plus hours on a full charge. My other one only got 2 hrs. This is due to the eMMc memory, no moving parts as in a hard drive. Every bit as powerful as a larger laptop. The only downside is that it doesn't have USB 3.0 ports or an Ethernet port, but this is easily remedied by using a multi port hub that connects to its USB C port. (also available on Amazon). It comes loaded with Windows 10 S version, but it's easily converted to Windows 10 Home Version. I believe that this machine was designed with students in mind, but I see many adults using small laptops like this, so they're great for adults on the go too.

Great as work laptop,"Reason I bought this is to be used next to a microscope, so I can write reports while looking through the microscope. Screen quality is okay. Keyboard is kind of small but you can’t expect much from an 11 inch notebook. Storage is just for basic programs (Office and Edge mostly). The only small backdraw is the numpad on the mousepad sensor thingie.. it gets stuck sometimes but you can just get an external numpad or use the ones in the keyboard. Small size storage, but, is just a small lab/biz PC (bought a 128 gb flash drive to store reports)",J Varela,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on February 22, 2021",One person found this helpful

Great Budget Laptop,"Bought this laptop for my daughter, who is in first grade, to use for her zoom (online) classes and school work. It works great. Please realize that this is NOT a premium laptop, so don't expect anything fancy or outlandish performance. It works well for actions that do not require a lot of RAM/speed, like zoom meetings, watching videos, listening to music and basic school work. Having used Intel Celeron based laptops before, I was careful not to install too many software (that will only slow it down). The screen, speed and memory are adequate for my daughter's school needs. Finally, I switched it from Windows 10s to Windows 10 because 10s was too limiting/didn't support some downloads/didn't have any good apps in the Windows ""appstore"".

You will need a separate Webcam,"I just wanted something simple to use for files and meetings. However, the webcam is awful. The image is poor quality and if you move at all you will be one big blur, so I will need to buy a separate webcam to use.

"Ok, not great","I got this to log my collectibles and maybe make some PowerPoint presentations about them. For those uses, it’s acceptable. If you’re looking for a hard working computer keep looking. Obviously it’s not a high powered gaming rig so don’t expect speed or anything, but for basic tasks like running office programs and maybe organizing files it’s sufficient, if a little slow. It’s also small, which was what I was specifically looking for without having chrome os, so it doesn’t have great visuals. But it is clear enough to work with. For what it is, it is great, I took a star off though because it doesn’t hold a charge, even when powered off. I mainly work with it plugged in and always let it get to 100% before I shut it down and unplug it. But it dies after a day or two of being shut off, which makes it forget the Wi-Fi and it takes a few restarts to get it fixed. I don’t use it daily so I usually leave it powered down, I just wish it would have power when I need it again. So, if you’re looking for a small portable netbook that can run Microsoft office programs and do basic things, this isn’t a bad choice for the price, just be ready to work near an outlet.",Thorin O.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on July 3, 2022",10 people found this helpful

Great product but only one issue.,"I had a previous version of this laptop before so after four years I decided to get a replacement and gift my old one to a friend.  The laptop works great just like the last one.  It's perfect for basic work like office suites and surfing the web,  It is lightweight and I take it with me when living abroad.  The only issue I have with it is that even though I have the power management set to shut entirely down with either the lid closed or pressing the power button, The battery isn't holding the charge.  I can fully charge it, shut down and unplug it; in about three days, it will be about 35 percent battery life.  However, I don't know if its MS 11 or the Hardware itself.  Other than that, I love the Asus product line and this little laptop.

Great little machine BUT be AWARE that it is now loading windows 11,"My laptop was delivered today -- 6/9/2022.  Its a real gem in terms of size/weight/excellent screen/speed etc.  However there was an unpleasant shock.  Without giving me any choice in the matter, a screen announced that the laptop would now download windows 11, which it proceeded to do.  I used my desktop to check online and undoing the window 11 back to 10 is supposed to be easy.  You have 10 days to try 11 and then you supposedly can go to SETTINGS: RECOVER: and find an entry for ROLL BACK.  SETTINGS and RECOVERY are there but no rollback.  I'll going to try windows 11 for a few days and then try to figure out how to roll back to windows 10 if that's what I decide.  I REALLY REALLY REALLY hate it when a machine dictates an upgrade from one OS to another OS without giving me any say in the matter.",Keen,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 10, 2022",8 people found this helpful

Its a laptop,Its a cheap nonchromebook laptop so you get what you'd expect.

Not bad for the price.,"The selling point on this for me was that one of the pictures in the description says it has a backlit keyboard. As it turns out, it does not. (You can apparently actually tell this by hovering over the image of the F keys. There's no backlight on/off option.) The entire point of me wanting a laptop was to do my homework in bed at night. Thankfully I accidentally/serendipitously ordered a book light at the same time, so I was able to get my homework done tonight. I'm also not thrilled that the price dropped between ordering it and receiving it, but that's life sometimes. Otherwise, I'm absolutely in love with the size, the touchpad is definitely innovative (if the manual was tl;dr, tap the upper right with two fingers together to right click.) I was able to fit my fiance's old 10"" tablet case over this to give it some extra protection. It works great with the stand I got from another seller, and once I inserted a 16gb micro SD to move O365 to, cleaned up all the excess install files, and took it out of S mode, it sped right back up.",Joy,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 26, 2021",One person found this helpful
Do your research and make a wise decision,"This is a great little laptop to use for simple functions.  The price is extremely reasonable but anyone considering this purchase needs to be aware it only runs Microsoft Edge. You cannot use Chrome or Firefox or any other browser. You can only install apps from the Microsoft store. If you choose to leave this system you can never go back and your laptop will not run as fast or be as safe. Had I known this I probably would not have purchased this computer.  Having said that, I never returned it because I really like it. It runs clean and fast, it has multiple great features, it is simple to use, the battery life is fabulous, and you can't beat the price.  For me, it's perfect.  Just be aware and do some research because it may not be right for you. Ok, I am 3 months in now so I will update this review. I have been having a problem with error messages constantly popping up. It makes my laptop unusable and nothing resets it. Control, Alt, Delete doesn't work, switching it off doesn't work either. I called a tech for support and her suggestion was to take it out of ""S"" mode. I told her everything I had researched and she informed me that it was the only way to get rid of the error messages. This computer is only sold with Microsoft Edge and it is a partnership with Asus. She then suggested I get in touch with Microsoft. I am past my return date and at this point I may just take it out of S mode. Frustration is high. Maybe buy something else because at this point I wish I had.",D.

"BEWAREl, it seems as though ASUS has issues with ALL their computers...","This is my second ASUS this year.  And it's only March.  My first one I bought earlier in the year and it was expensive compared to what it can do.  The biggest issue I have with it is that it will give me the blue screen of death constantly, and I'm a writer, so it's always messing up what I'm writing.  Then my dog dropped it once off my bed and BAM!  The screen completely shattered.  So it's no longer a laptop, as I have permanantly hooked up to my TV in my living room.  So I got this little netbooky thing for writing and kept the other for gaming (Steam games only, as I don't think it can handle more).  And I've had it a couple days and now this one is also giving me the blue screen of death.  I cannot be without a computer as a writer.  So, now, I'm going to have to wipe this one and return it, and buy another brand, because I CANNOT have it just shutting down on me like that.  Getting the blue screen of death repeatedly usually means your motherboard or hard drive is breaking.  And both of these computers are brand freaking new!  Ughhhhh.  IF it wasn't for this issue, I'd give it five stars.  And I was editing a document when it happened, so I wasn't running anything crazy, nor have I downloaded anything but Firefox.

It is very snappy and can easily be booted up to Chrome from being powered down in about 20 seconds. The only problem I have with it is the very low 64gb of SD storage. When you first receive it, the system already takes up about 10gb of this so you are only left with around 54gb for everything you’re doing.

A Good Choice - More than Adequate - Relatively Low Cost,"I spent many hours making a decision about what laptop to buy. I think I made a good choice. This is a more-than-adequate laptop for general computing needs. Although there was minimal documentation included with this budget-priced Acer laptop, it was not hard to get started. It came with full-featured Windows 11 Home, not the limited ""S"" version. And Windows 11 turns out to be refreshing after Windows 10's screen-hogging tiles. The case is attractive and a step up from our old black-cased laptops. The unit is lighter and thinner than our previous laptops and gets an ""A"" for portability. The display is good and sharp. ///// We paid a little more to get the Ryzen 5 series processor and the machine is significantly faster than the Windows 10 computers we had before. Admittedly, this laptop is not used for gaming or dense graphic arts work in Illustrator or Photoshop... We use a powerful desktop for that. But for general business purposes, especially those requiring portability, this is a fine choice at relatively low cost. A negative was that Norton was pre-installed but it was not difficult to uninstall. ///// Note: We have just purchased this computer, and this review is our initial impression. If it prematurely fails or develops mechanical problems, this review will be updated.",Careful Buyer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 27, 2022",45 people found this helpful

I had to return it.,"I had a couple of random restarts that were concerning but the real deal killer was the audio.  On video calls with my daughter, the sound would just stop working and you'd have to end the call and restart.  Some videos were inaudible with the volume all the way up.  External speakers weren't much better.  I don't know if it was an issue with the jack or the speakers or the cord.  Again, there were times it was inaudible and then it would be too loud because you had to have the volume full blast the majority of the time cuz you could barely hear anything.  And tick, tick, tick every time you clicked on something.  These are the same speakers I was using for my PC and I did not have that problem.  It's a shame really, because other than that, it was an ok laptop.  The screen was ok.  When it wasn't crashing it was fast.  I would probably reset it and given it a second chance if it wasn't for the sound.  And then, I also bought stuff to go with it like an extra mouse for travel and a laptop desk for sitting on the couch.  I'm not going to be returning all that so expense I didn't need.

I ended up having to by a security, malware scanning/removing program because the pop ups were BEYOND obnoxious. I’ll literally get upwards of 25 pop ups as soon as I start up the computer that clearly shouldn’t be there. My scanning program can’t get them to disappear permanently, so I have to scan this computer EVERY SINGLE TIME I TURN IT ON!

Then a few days after the return window closed, it stopped biting entirely and said it needed to repair itself. But no repair options would work. Finally I called acer, which said because it was purchased through Amazon, I could not return it. I could only ship it for repair, which would take weeks. I asked about reinstalling Windows and they agreed I could try that first, but now I must wait a week for acer to send me a physical copy of Windows.

Disappointing - the laptop and the lack of assistance from Amazon,"As some of the other reviews have mentioned, the laptop is very loud - opening a browser, loud; opening Word or PowerPoint, loud; simply on the home screen; loud. It may not be every unit, but it does appear to be a common defect. My laptop was also crooked; on a level surface, it would tilt to one side. It also kept restarting randomly. I drew the short straw to be sure. Amazon (who was the direct seller for this unit) was particularly, and in fairness uncharacteristically unhelpful. They gave me two options to return it: either a UPS pick-up, which doesn't work in my apartment building (the UPS person won't be able to get up to my apartment) or I could pay out of my own pocket to return the defective item. I contacted Amazon consumer service to see if I could get another option (e.g., providing me a label), and the agent just kept repeating those two options over and over again. Incidentally, in the ""I'll Ship It Myself"" option, Amazon would refund me up to $3.99 for the turn. Purchasing the label to return it myself cost me almost $20. Is that a lot of money? No. But, within the context of this purchase, it was upsetting. It cemented an already poor experience. Mostly though I write this review so that others who are thinking about buying it can know ahead of time that, if their unit is defective, they may likewise need to go out of pocket to return it.",Someone,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on May 15, 2022",8 people found this helpful

Very good laptop for this price range! The Ryzen 5 5500U is pretty quick!,"This is probably one of the best laptops you can get for the price range! It boots fast and responds fast. The graphics can handle basic consumer requirements with ease but you won't be able to game with high graphics settings. Gaming feels fine with lower to lower mid graphics settings but it started struggling once I started cranking it up. The screen quality is amazing for a laptop at this price. The colors and brightness feel well-balanced. The brightness lacks a little in bright and sunny rooms but is great overall. The battery life lasts an entire day for me easily with mild usage, although it drains pretty quick when gaming. The build quality feels good but it's almost all plastic so it doesn't feel very premium. I love how slim and lightweight this thing is as well.

Maybe it's just me...,"Even though my first experience with a gaming platform was the Magnavox Odyssey, and my first ownership of a gaming platform was the Atari 2600, and my first computer was the Commodore 64, I have kept up with technology the entire way since then. I have found it disconcerting and annoying that we the people have allowed things to become the way they have. There is no way apparently to even get this laptop started without an email address providing your name personal information and an internet connection. All of these things lead to an invasion of my privacy. Although it seems free to allow every large company on planet Earth to know everything about everybody, it isn't free. There will be penalties there will be consequences. Science fiction has provided many scenarios, but that's why it's called fiction. The reality of the thing is that's pretty soon we will not be able to make a decision by ourselves. I've noticed that some people already cannot do anything without checking out a video first. Everything and everybody is tracked. I use my phone to check my credit card account, my bank account, the TV listings and some internet browsing. I recently installed a tracker blocker made by Duck Duck Go. The aforementioned use of my phone produces 3,000 blocked trackers every 7 days. It is disgusting and creepy. I cannot leave my house or dozens of or maybe hundreds or thousands of companies know where I am and know that I'm not home and know that there's no one at home because I'm gone. At any time you can stop by and do what you want because they know I'm not home. This laptop has language written by Microsoft that tells me how much they are helping me by allowing them to track me. And in so many words, that's not true. Many people, and it was seeing the younger generation, does not see the problem with this. I hear people say, ""everybody does it"" as if that makes it okay. It is not okay, but my laptop is more than 10 years old and I needed a new one. I can repair my old appliances and some of the old electronics. I can repair older cars, in fact my new car is 20 years old. Unlike the people on TV, I do regular maintenance and I do not have breakdowns. Everything today has programmed obsolescence. There was a time when durable goods meant 16 to 20 years. Today, durable goods last 2 to 4 years. My refrigerator is was purchased at Sears by me in 1995. It still works. My washer and dryer was also purchased in 1995 and they still work. I will be lucky to get four or five years out of this laptop. I am sure windows will be more than happy to sell another copy of their software on some company's laptop. In a time wheen people are more and more aware that the resources on planet earth are finite, we manufacture goods that will end up in a landfill.",NostraEd,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2022",19 people found this helpful

Every windows computer since windows 8 has come with windows defender. Once you uninstall Norton windows defender will kick in. From my experience windows defender is the best antiviral program for a windows computer. It also comes with firefox which I dislike but that's a personal preference. Since its a windows computer it also comes with Edge, another program I dislike. I've never been a fan of windows default browsers.",Erika,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2022",One person found this helpful

Don't count on Support from Acer,I purchased this computer for my business with the intend of upgrading it with a Acer Solid State Drive. After setting up and transferring all programs to this laptop I began to add the SSD. Acer did have decent instructions on how to do this on their support site. When I went to connect the SSD cable to the socket the socket (on the mother board) would not lock the cable into position. The locking flap will not snap into place locking the cable. I tried to contact Acer Online Support and was required to enter the S/N which I did. The automated response was my laptop was out of warranty. Not sure why as I had had the laptop 4 days at this point and the date of manufacture was less than 90. I had to submit proof of purchase which I did and I am still awaiting a response. Next step was to contact Acer Support by phone. After a couple of calls I was told I would have to send the laptop into Acer for inspection (at my cost) and probably eventually receive a  replacement . Also this would take 10 days plus. I run a business and can not afford to be without a computer for day to day business. I asked about local support and was informed that I would have to pay for it myself.

I’m constantly getting errors and “cannot connect” messages. I’ve updated printer drivers and nothing. I have to keep pulling out my old laptop to print anything. What’s frustrating is that it’s also random. Sometimes it will print but most of the time it’s a 30-45 minute headache for a simple one page word document.

When I had warranty work done on my HP; they shipped me a box with padding in just a couple days and I downloaded a label immediately.  This ACER and support are very disappointing.

Great laptop for school and office,This is my second Acer and I love it. It’s very fast and easy to upgrade. I wouldn’t buy a laptop without illuminated keyboard and at least a Full HD screen any more . It’s a must-have these days and this laptop has it all. It’s coming without all the pre- installed bloatware like Norton Antivirus or McAfee. Excellent value. I saw some negative comments about Windows S being a trap or worse and there is only one thing for you to know: anyone who is willing to spend 10 seconds to search the internet for information on how to switch your Windows S version to a normal Windows version will see that there is free App in the Microsoft Store that does that with a few clicks.,Claudio,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 8, 2022",31 people found this helpful

"Acer Aspire 5 A515-46-R3UB only has ONE RAM slot, not two.","I would just like to note that this model only has one RAM slot, not two, as the Q&A answers from Acer have stated. I purchased two 16GB modules on the basis that I would be able to take out the 4GB module and then put the two new ones in, giving me 32GB total. However when you take the back cover off, there is only one RAM slot on the motherboard. I don't mean one FREE ram slot, just one slot, period. It's empty, which means I was able to put one of the 16GB modules in, making for a total of 20GB, which isn't bad, but it's annoying to do your due diligence and read everything you can about a product, including statements from the manufacturer, only to find that the reality is different. My guess is that earlier models did in fact have two RAM slots, but since Amazon mixes models together on the same product page, it can be impossible to know exactly which model someone is talking about. Whatever, it is what it is, just know that this particular model A515-46-R3UB only has a single RAM slot. I don't even know where the other 4GB module is, maybe soldered onto the motherboard elsewhere, but I looked everywhere and I couldn't see any other places to put a second RAM module. I'm not a computer expert by any means, but I am a software developer and I have built my own PC from motherboard up, so I know what a RAM slot looks like.

I needed a computer with a lot of storage, a fairly large screen, a numerical keypad, and most importantly, a cheap price tag. This computer has all of those things. I don't do any gaming or anything really sophisticated on it. Just work and some internet browsing. It boots up quickly and has been running smoothly so far. My biggest complaint is that it came with a lot of Microsoft bloatware that I hadn't experienced on my other laptops and by default it uses your Microsoft OneDrive for storage instead of the computer's SSD. The first time I logged onto the computer it asked me to either sign up for a Microsoft account or login to an existing one. My job requires me to take a lot of photos, so I was saving my photos to the computer without realizing it was uploading to my cloud storage account. That was an annoyance because I had to figure out how to switch that off. I unintentionally used up all of my cloud storage space because I didn't realize the system was set up that way. Once I figured out how to fix it, I was good to go. Also, the computer essentially comes in a ""safe mode"" which limits a lot of what you can do. It is designed for you to only use apps from the Microsoft app store and not download any software from any other source. It can be turned off, but it is another annoyance. I feel like they were trying to make it like their version of a Chromebook, but that makes it just as annoying as a Chromebook. Overall, it is a great computer once you get past all the Microsoft stuff.",LeTara M.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 9, 2022",6 people found this helpful

"Best budget laptop, exceeded expectations","I bought this purely for taking online college courses and only expected to use it for internet browsing and Microsoft Office products but I have been pleasantly surprised by how powerful this computer is. I downloaded Steam just for kicks and installed some of my older games - this laptop plays a lot of older titles like Half-Life 2, Dawn of War, Mass Effect, Medieval: Total War, and STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl etc at maximum settings with high framerates, and without bursting into flames. Who would have thought from a laptop with just integrated graphics? Also: the screen quality is excellent, full HD 1920x1080 with good color and a nice finish with no glare. The speakers are pretty good too! Long battery life, and good build quality - it feels solid with a nice metal frame, but not heavy at all. Only downside is limited HD space, but it comes with a mounting bracket to install a second HD inside, which I plan on doing. Overall, this is an incredible value if you’re looking to do internet browsing, Blackboard, light gaming and streaming movies or TV.",Sam,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on July 18, 2022",2 people found this helpful

I also use it for Project Gorgon (Steam) as well when I need to be away from my main computer. This is by no means a gaming laptop for modern games but older games should be fine.

I was a bit bummed that the universal USB port didn't work but it's probably something driver related... should've been tested before they mailed it. As for shipping, I think amz did that and they didn't include much packaging material at all (same issue with a phone I bought, just loose in the box thumping around) so that's not something I can rate here.

Very Happy With This Machine!,"I've only had this laptop a few days but I thought I would post some first impressions. This is a really nice laptop for business, web browsing, watching movies and possibly even gaming though I have not done any gaming on it thus far and likely will not. It's light weight, battery life seems very good, screen really looks good, colors are well saturated and balanced, the picture is crisp. It just seems like a really high quality well though out design. The keyboard action is fantastic and the track pad just feels nice to the touch. I have not done any video conferencing with it yet so I can't comment on the camera, but the sound is quite good for a laptop. Also very impressed with Windows 11. I had to install some ancient software on this laptop, an old Dymo printer and an ancient version of Word from 2003....both run without a hitch. Immediately recognized my Epson printer and well, it all just works. The Ryzen processor is very snappy, the whole laptop is quick and responsive. This my first Ryzen machine, always used tried and true Intel but this was an eye opener. This AMD chip really impressed me. Overall could not be happier with this machine and the price was fantastic.

Crippled and bloated right out of the box,"Acer are doing themselves a disservice by selling a Windows 11 machine with only 4 gigs of memory and loading it with adware. Thanks to the onboard graphics chip only 3.4 gigs are available for Windows and programs. With this limited amount of memory available to Win 11 it performs horribly, stuttering and jittering on the desktop with nothing running. Acer then compounds this by adding their own adware (half-screen Norton ads) in addition to Microsoft's constant badgering to use Edge, Teams and Office. I added an additional 4 gigs and performance improved quite a bit but make no mistake: this is not a powerhouse.",Scott in Moultrie,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 13, 2022",One person found this helpful

Also...added a 4gb memory stick as the 4 gig installed originally is waaaay to little.  Bottom line....This is a cheap laptop for limited functions.  You can surf the web and see youtube videos ok...but don't think you could do any reasonable gaming or real work on it.  I is just fine for what I do...and is better than a chromebook.  Don't buy to do anything more with it.",Tech N. Cal,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on June 3, 2022",One person found this helpful

Just Read Please lol,So this is a pretty decent budget laptop! Runs pretty fast and gets the job done. My BIGGEST complaints are the wireless card and the ethernet port. They are both pretty bad. The wireless card is weak. The ethernet port is designed with a lip that doesn't securely hold the ethernet piece in and so any movement and you'll be knocked offline.,Morgann,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on August 17, 2022",One person found this helpful

Fantastic,For the price it is a fantastic laptop. I expected a lot less from this but only issue with me is the sata storage you can add. You can add it in well but when you close the bottom it is not meant to have a extra storage in there. You can’t fully clip the bottom and it had a giant bump on the bottom making it uneven. Other then that it comes with 4GB of ram that are not able to take out and you can only add on one more stick off ram.

But it is so much more than a basic laptop that I can certainly understand why it is in the top slot on Amazon! I did buy and install a 500 GB digital drive and upgraded the memory to 20 GB.

If you want one for gaming, video editing, or other similar intensive compute/memory types of uses, then this one is not a good choice.

Good Laptop for My Needs,"I needed a laptop with a decent battery life, and room for upgrade. Mostly for office work and media consumption. Web surfing needed, strong wifi, I wanted S mode for security. I wanted access to office.com for document use. I wanted decent audio too. The laptop I got provided all of that. The audio at 100 percent was adequate for media, but my Bluetooth speaker works better. I can still hear it fine without the Bluetooth. I charged the laptop to 100 percent and watched a series, I like, for three hours before it reached 50 percent. So, for media consumption at full brightness gave me plenty of battery. I think I could get a total of five- or six-hours watching movies. I charged it back up from 50 percent to 100 percent in two hours while I watched more series episodes. I keep the touch pad turned off all the time. I never use it, because I prefer a wireless mouse. The laptop is about the size of my 14-inch Chromebook. This laptop, however, is more powerful.

Not sure if the problem is with the adapter or the computer.  Will be ordering a new adapter as Amazon did give us a refund for that. I hope this is not a COMPUTER ISSUE!!. I bought this for my son for his school assignments. Yesterday this is what the screen started doing AND FREEZING UP!!. I have had the computer for a week maybe.

I was able to install Chrome and the other programs I like very easily and it was working for me instantly once I plugged it in.

avoid at all costs. ships w. defective bios!,"i bought this laptop thinking it would be perfect. i looked at a lot of other models and this one seemed the best and it was cheap. i found out first hand why that is when it arrived. first of all please avoid this laptop at all costs. it looks like a great cheap laptop. its defective from the factory. please research this for yourself. it ships with a firmware that will prevent the battery from charging. that’s right. from the factory it will brick itself and not charge. if your install takes too long or if you buy it and you don’t have over 40% battery charge to install the newest bios from acer, which voids your windows home s right off the bat, you are stuck with a brick. there’s no way to charge the battery. i got to go through the forced microsoft startup experience which took about 30 minutes to complete due to the computer deciding to get online and completely update windows with no way to bypass it first thing and then i wondered why it wasn’t charging. i found out at 15% battery remaining that it was a critical bios issue but if it dropped below 40% i would no longer be able to charge it. and that’s what happened. as i frantically sat with my brand new computer i tried to force the bios update, the machine hit 10% battery life, auto power saving hibernation mode instantly, i tried to reboot into windows and it’s bricked with a red battery logo now.",brandon,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on September 14, 2022",8 people found this helpful

"Fast, light and easy to use. Excellent buy.",I was surprised by how solid the construction seems.

I installed a micro SD card and that adds plenty of extra on board storage. Just be sure to format the card after installation. Then you have to power down and back up for the computer to recognize the card. I connected a bluetooth mouse and that works great. Even the scroll bar on the mouse works. I'm not someone who needed another computer but I'm happy I bought this one. The screen is bright and detailed. Colors look good. It is rated to be able to be dropped 4 feet but don't try it just to see. Just know that it is rugged.

Excellent for the price,"With an old iMac and old iPhone, and unable to afford to replace them with expensive new models, I was so frustrated not being able to access most updated websites any longer. This Chromebook is the perfect, inexpensive alternative. Loving it so far. Easy to figure it out. So much faster than my old iMac. I'll keep that to store my 18,000 photos and Word files and use my iPhone as an actual phone, but use this for everything online. So much more comfortable to use this on a tray table pulled up to my couch, instead of sitting stiffly at my desk.

not worth it,"I tried using this product for my schoolwork which was a terrible idea, I wish I did more of my research. The Chromebook is basically just a large phone for playing games you could've played on your phone. just try and open up a PowerPoint file, its just gonna give you a chrome extension that's corrupted. I tried opening a zip file that i downloaded off my school website and it was empty.

Caution: Not working 6 months later,"I bought 2 of these Chromebooks.  They were great until they stopped working.  One of them stopped charging about 5 months after I bought it.  Acer honored the warranty, and fixed it.  The 2nd one stopped charging about 6 months after I bought it, and Acer is not going to fix it.  Acer is saying it out of warranty even though I sent them proof of purchase showing that it is not.  These Chromebooks are not worth the hassle.  They do not last.  Very frustrating.

Great laptop computer,"I purchased this because I am tired of laptops that run Windows crashing two to three years after purchase.  I read a review on this Chromebook where the user said it's a perfect computer if you don't have much to do with it.  And that description fits me perfectly.  It is a great computer for watching Netflix, checking email, doing basic online and word processing stuff.  Also, it is lighting quick on startup.  It's almost hard to believe I put up with Windows for so long.  This computer is very user friendly, I wish I would have purchased one sooner.

Perfect for clumsy kids or on the go,"I've been in the market for two new laptops since we have had really bad luck with several of our devices breaking. As a single parent, needing to get two of them can be a big expense especially if they are just going to break again.  I needed one for my son's school and one for my business. Originally, I ordered this for myself, but I couldn't believe how durable and strong it is. It's definitely meant for heavy wear and tear or clumsy kids. When we were forced into remote learning my son had his first laptop which was borrowed, but no matter how hard he tried, he scratched it up so much and nearly trashed it. When I was reading about it, it makes me want to laugh when it said it's military grade because that's what I need to get when I buy my son things... Something that's military grade because he's a hot hyperactive mess at times lol. My dogs and child need military grade. Just opening and closing it walking around I feel so confident. It's not made of that easily scratched material. It has traction when you hold it as it's not slippery and has grip. Knowing that it is spill proof is miraculous, but I will use my brain and not test that out. It's a small computer and screen but not too small where it's a problem. When you first set it up you choose if it's for a child or yourself. I've tried both options and did a ""whitewash"" factory reset to try the other. I like the features of the child as he needs to get permission to do certain things. You do have to set them up with an email address, and I created a new one just for this since I don't want him having access to my business or personal email information. There's a lot of tracking within it. When you first set it up it asks if you want Google Assistant, and when I click, ""no"" it still has it enabled so I had to go into the settings and switch it off since I don't need any extra tracking (Even though we all know they track absolutely everything). Yeah, I'm one that puts a sticker over the camera hole too, but don't judge me. I really wish laptops didn't connect all your other accounts when you first set it up. I miss the old days of feeling anonymous and not like somebody's up in my business. I just want to have my lock screen and zero requirements regarding an email or any other identifying information. Nothing is private anymore. Most people don't like that.",🌿 Fern 🌿,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on April 8, 2022",7 people found this helpful

Great value,"I bought this as a gift to replace my bfs Toshiba 13334 chromebook from 2014. The Toshiba had begun to disconnect itself from the wifi on a regular basis. Power washing it did nothing. Since it reached it's expiration date I bought this to replace it. It's around the same weight but the screen on this is larger. Set up was very simple and there were no issues. My bf uses it mostly to surf the web and watches TONS of videos. Since I have not heard any cursing regarding the use of his computer, I say it's a win.

So even if your data starts on a memory stick it isn't saved there on a chromebook.

Solid performance and crisp graphics,"I purchased the Acer 314 as a replacement for my Acer model CB3-431 Chromebook, which had just reached its AUE date. So far the new model has delivered solid performance and crisp graphics, all that I could ask for. The fact that the Acer 314 was sold by Amazon, and delivered from their warehouse, was important to me, as I had a recent unpleasant experience with one of Amazon's selling partners. I'd previously ordered a different brand laptop, as new, from an independent seller through Amazon. What I received was the wrong model number laptop in a plain unbranded box without a manual or any literature, just the laptop and power cord; nothing to indicate I had actually received a new item, and never mind that it was the wrong model number to begin with. Big red flags! Naturally I returned the laptop, and many thanks to Amazon for seeing to a prompt refund. Lesson learned was always to check the reviews of any independent Amazon partner or reseller, just as one would check reviews for an item being considered. Ordering the Acer 314 sold by Amazon and shipped from their warehouse ensured that I would receive the correct model number, new, in an Acer-branded box, and complete with all the attendant manuals and literature I had expected. Moreover, it arrived within 48 hours, a plus. Under Settings > About ChromeOS > Additional details, the Acer 314 is scheduled to receive automatic updates until June 2027, which is okay with me as I should probably be ready for a new laptop by then anyway.

Great little computer helper,"From the picture you can see I am writing the review on this computer right now. The little pink sticky is covering the webcam, if you were at all curious. It is a great little addition to my computer family and it makes it easy for me to do quick computer requests and work when needed. It starts super fast and it is really easy to use. I would say buy yourself a Logitech Bluetooth mouse and it will make everything easier. The only drawback to this machine is that it isn't a Touch Screen. If you can live without that, then this is a fantastic addition to your house, work, or school. I added a 128 Gb microSD card to save anything I download or any documents I create. This saves space for any additional applications you may need. If you have never used a Chromebook, think of it like a tablet that you can type on and have a regular browser to use. All apps are downloaded from the Google Play store, don't mind if it says telephone only, most of them work just fine. Just a tip, I downloaded McAfee Safe Connect and McAfee Security by T-Mobile for safe web browsing and doing my banking. Don't use a free virus protector, pay for it.

Great little Chromebook for leisure usage,"I purchased one of these in July 2022 during a promotion from Amazon and bought second today at a deeper discount  It's a great little laptop (tabletop) to come home and relax, check emails, keep up with news, play Wordl etc. Great for Sunday morning with coffee news reading :)  Not for doing work stuff or Photoshop etc but I can check emails and know when I have I have to move to my desktops to get some work done .  It has 2 ports for charging cord connection, and instead of inserting a mini SD (which is available) I just use a high volume USB stick to transfer my downloads for PDF etc to tidy up the disk storage.  Great connection to my Google Drive to read my ebooks or listen to music I've uploaded there.  I could get a 10 inch tablet for the same price but prefer the keyboard feature for answering emails, typing out notes etc. Just ordered another one today for upstairs for same usage.  Keyboard works fine; so far no problems...I did download Adobe to read pdf files as the built in options were not working well.  Many Android apps work fine on this, you just have to set the view to tablet mode.  So far so good.....no problems although i'm only 3 months or so into the first one. Headphone port sounds awesome !! as well.

"Light, fast and sleek - for leisure and non-work use","I really wanted to like this. I bought this thinking Chrome OS would be similar to Windows. It runs more like a phone or tablet. The system is based on a Google/Gmail account (your password/login is your email and your password). This would be great for leisure use but I wanted a work computer. And after I turned it on, I realized I couldn’t install the Microsoft 365 suite for Windows on it. I’d have to go onto Google Play and install each program (i.e. Excel) separately and pay separately. Costing more and doesn’t have good reviews. It may just be too new for other programs like Photoshop to be available for it (I didn’t even look because it was getting to be too much work).

Great size for airline travel. Excellent battery life for watching movies,"This Chromebook met my needs in every way that I was looking for as far as being lightweight, thin, and small. I wanted something that was able to easily slip into my backpack but be pull out of the backpack really quickly when I wanted to watch movies or shows. I can put this in my backpack and barely know that it's in there.I'm happy to say that this works great for airline travel. It doesn't take up hardly any room in my lap on the small airplane seats, and the screen is actually about the same size as the screens on the airline that I've been using. I can easily connect this Chromebook to my headphones, and the flight goes by really quickly when using it. One thing that doesn't go by quickly though is the battery life on this chromebook. I took two flights and used the Chromebook quite a bit, and I noticed that I still had lots of battery life left on it when thinking about how  small this Chromebook is. The battery life increases or decreases in the bottom right hand corner of the screen depending on how high the brightness is, so I recommend changing that and you'll see your battery life meter fluctuate. For watching movies, I felt like the screen quality was mid grade. It didn't look like it was a high definition screen, but it didn't feel like it was low grade either. As far as the keyboard, I have pretty big hands, and I feel like it's somewhat easy to type on this keyboard. I wouldn't want to type on this small of a keyboard all day long, but for a few hours here and there it meets my needs. This Chromebook does not come with a case, but it does come with a charger which is a USB type-c. Keep in mind this isn't just a standard USB type-c like you would use for a cell phone, it is a USB type-c charger that is attached to a transformer.",Wes,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on April 6, 2022",3 people found this helpful

"GREAT upgrade from tablet for my kids, first Chromebook","I did a lot of research as to what to get for my kids to replace their aging and damaged Samsung Tab A's.

Works great,"I'm not some fancy tech lady, I'm just a busy working mom with a business and a child that needs remote learning or some tech time for fun. I ordered this for my business as well as for my son with remote learning or for him to play on if I need to keep him busy. It seems to be working great. I love that it doubles as a touch screen. It's a neat design where you can prop it up, but you want to be careful where you are setting it,, because you don't want to be rubbing the keyboard into some dirty. The dry erase board that's smaller for my son's school, that he can put underneath it if he's going to be using it around the house. You can also fold it flat just like an iPad. The touch screen works well. If you are not familiar with chromebook, you will need to set up an account to get it going. I really wish they didn't force you to give all your personal information like that, and I miss just being able to set it up without giving my identifying information. You have the option to set it up for a child and an adult, and I have used it both ways. For a child there are a lot of restrictions that you can set up for them and it will ask their age and you need to set up their email. I created email for my son, because I don't want him having access to my personal information since you're Google account will be tied to your computer. There are settings on it that if he tries to order or download certain things it tells him he needs to ask me and I will approve it. You can also connect this to another computer and I've used duet display but you need to pay for it on one computer. That's if you want to have dual monitors. I was bummed Chromebook doesn't support Filmora as part of my work is video creation, but right now Chromebook is not compatible. I always hook up external keyboards and mouses, because I can't type on laptops like this or I just messed up everything I'm typing as I need the big buttons, so I can't tell you how great or not great that is since they all annoy me. You can get the Netflix app on this one. I've had a laptop before that was not compatible with it, so that is great for my son. The computer seems to be pretty fast. I can run my business from this. The battery is great, but make sure you don't constantly have it charging or you will ruin your battery so let it drain as much as possible. Make sure you read the specs on the ports that this has, because Chromebooks don't have as many as most of the laptops out there so you might need additional products.  I think this is an affordable option and you get quite a bit. Sometimes a Chromebook like this just makes a lot more sense than spending quite a bit more on a regular laptop. Since this can double as a touchscreen and tablet you have the best of both worlds. It's big enough where you can see what you were doing on the screen, and small enough to be able to haul around pretty easily. I did invest in getting a screen protector since my son is only seven, and he can be a hot mess. That was pretty spendy at $20, so hopefully more people come out with some better prices for that down the road. Anyway, I'm really happy with this and so is my son, and I recommend.",🌿 Fern 🌿,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 1, 2022",47 people found this helpful
Cheap price and incredibly cheap quality,"I've had this Chromebook 8mons now. From day one the touchscreen response has been really poor on games, and art programs. There are no compatible pens to help either. Ive tried felt tips, point tip, etc. For some reason this laptop does not maintain Internet connections.  It connects and works when it wants too. The screen freezes pretty often. Ctrl, ATL Del DOES NOT work for this Chromebook. Keep in mind this not a windows or apple so, not too many 'preferred apps' are compatible with GOOGLE hardware. I also use browser savings extensions like, Capital one savings. Unfortunately it IS NOT compatible so I'm forced to shop and save on my phone.

The laptop can fully convert to a tablet by flipping the hinge completely back and also use the hinge to stand the laptop up by itself.

Love the touchscreen and the tablet mode.  The video quality leaves a bit to be desired but for a 200 dollar unit i can't complain.  My wife loves it and that's the best part :)",Chef Mag,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on July 7, 2021",

Solid family chromebook,"I purchased the chromebook because my wife needs a basic computer and my kid also needs one for his remote learning. By creating a primary account and a supervised account, the chromebook serves both purposes. The touchscreen makes it easy to interact with many apps. The keyboard and touchpad are usable. The battery usually lasts a full day (8 hours) with mixed use. The sound is loud and clear. The USB C and USB A ports are nice, but I hope there is a HDMI port. I bought a USB-C to HMDI adapter to output to an monitor. The chromebook is light and never gets hot. My only complain is the thick benzel, making the small screen look even smaller.",Chihchun Chien,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on August 31, 2020",One person found this helpful

"Excellent lightweight, reasonably priced Chromebook, but not a good substitute for an iPad","Assessment after six months: This is an excellent low priced Chromebook overall, with fine screen quality and light weight. Set up was easy as is true of most Chromebooks. I purchased it to replace an older iPad, which I liked but was slow, and lacked connectivity and available keyboards. This Chromebook has two USB-C ports and two standard USB ports.  The keyboard is first rate and the track pad is good enough that I don't need a mouse. Accessing files on a USB key is easy enough on a Chromebook but impossible on an iPad. I have encountered only two significant drawbacks. The first is a touchscreen that is slightly  inferior to the iPad. Those of us who are new to the Chromebook need to realize that it is a hybrid: in some respects it resembles an iPad and in others a PC, with advantages and disadvantages compared to either one.  This particular Chromebook is not appreciably faster than my six year old iPad.",David A. Gantz,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 31, 2022",15 people found this helpful

Great little laptop,"Delivery was fast -- 2nd day.  After completing the battery charge, it booted right up.  I followed instructions to copy all files and apps from my pc.

I'm not really tech savvy, and so I'm glad that the 3 devices shook hands and completed their business without any help from me.  The unit I bought did not come with a mouse, so I ordered one separately.  It is the Peibo Upgraded Bluetooth Wireless Mouse for Laptop (also arrived 2nd day).  Once I figured out the steps involved in pairing the mouse with the Chromebook, they also shook hands and work really well together.  I'm very pleased with this setup.

I have an extensive music collection that I keep on an external SSD and I absolutely love MediaMonkey because of it's customizable interface on it's Window's app (I assumed the ChromeOS version would be very similar - my first major stumble).",Craig Olsen,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2022",19 people found this helpful

"Does not support a regular sim card that I use in my camera, only the mini phone ones.","Had I read the reviews, I wouldn't have purchased this particular Chromebook. I use my digital camera a lot and my old Chromebook supported a regular sized sim card ( which is what is in my camera ) I have to use a card reader with my sim card now and it's a hassle. Also, the sound on this Chromebook is not very loud, the sound on my old Chromebook was louder. I really like the touch screen on this new one which is something my old one didn't have.  The battery life on this new one is also shorter than the one on my old Chromebook, by a lot. My battery didn't require charging nearly as often as this one does for a couple of years. This one already needs charged pretty much every day and I don't use it that much.

Excellent when on sale,"I purchased my first Acer Chromebook in 2015 and the updates to the software just expired. For those who don’t know, Google chrome books technically have a software update expiration date after which they no longer update software. I found this Chromebook on sale for price that was too good to pass up and decided to upgrade my old one. If I didn’t think Acer made a good Chromebook I would not have purchased another one. That said, the one thing to know about Acer Chrome books which is happened to all three that I’ve owned over different generations is that they will appear to die at certain points. You won’t be able to power them up, the screen will be blank, etc.  it does not happen all that often and there is an easy fix for this.  Do you need a small screwdriver set which is typically carried at a dollar store and can be used to open watches it’s very small screws. Unscrew the back of the Chromebook which has about 12 very small screws. And very carefully pull the back panel off of the rest of the machine.  It is held on with Clips so carefully worked her way around it and watch out for any ribbon cables that may stay attached to the bottom panel. Now all you have to do is look at the big battery pack and look at where it is plugged into the motherboard and pull the clip out that connects the motherboard to the battery, it is just a small plug that you pull out. Count to 10 and plug it back in and the machine should work fine until the next time it happens which is usually months and months away. Otherwise, a fine machine. I don’t know why in the seven years since I purchased the first one but the Acer machines seem to still have this problem.

Don't buy!,I have always bought acer in the past and never had a problem. This model unfortunately is the worst! I've only had it for 2 months and it continues to have glitches! After only owning the product for a month the screen blacked out! I had a presentation at work that day and it wouldn't do anything! The power button wasn't working and it stayed black for a few hours! Finally...the power button worked and I had a normal screen again! So frustrating! Ruined my presentation! From time to time the screen and the keys just freeze up! I have to turn off the power and turn it back on a few times. I contacted Acer and they want me to send my computer to them but doesn't offer a replacement while I'm they are working on it. I need my computer on a daily basis for my work!

Was a little reluctant I love using my phone but I didn't know if the Chromebook would do the things that I wanted it to do. But I was pleasantly surprised I can play videos use my Amazon prime Netflix browse the web basically anything that I can do on my phone. I would recommend this to anybody it is the perfect replacement for an old windows that did not stream correctly could not handle bandwidth any and all of the above. There's only two things I'm not thrilled about the quality of the video is very good not high def but not garbage either. The only thing that I really have an issue with is I wanted to use a computer and or Chromebook but I did not want to have all the links to my Google account and when I did set it up I set it up to sync which was a mistake.

PERSONAL DATA STOLEN FROM US,"I am heartbroken and furious right now. Shortly after receiving this Acer Chromebook, I inserted a USB drive into the USB port/hub to view my daughters baby photos with her. First of all the USB port is extremely stiff and it takes a bit of pressure to insert a USB disk into it, much more difficult than I am used to. After inserting the flash drive, the Chromebook gave a notification like ""Woah, be careful"" or something like that. I thought that this was strange. After closing out and ejecting drive, very similar to Windows but never with these issues, I reinserted the USB drive again to show my daughter more of her baby pictures and to our shock, they were all completely gone. Every file and image was removed as well as our tax returns with Social Security numbers. We are so sad right now as we try to fix this. We have not had any luck so far. My husband just purchased this Acer Chromebook for me less than 2 weeks ago. We always kept our photos and important files on a USB drive and we never ran into problems like this with Microsoft Windows XP, 7, 8 and 10. We would simply close out the window, safely eject the usb drive and reinsert it back into the hub later. In this case, this system never presented me with a startup tutorial or  a How To Guide like Microsoft always did so I was never able to backup any files because I didn't know how.",Prime Member,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on June 23, 2022",11 people found this helpful

Faulty Devise,"For the first week everything was fine. It was a two-in-one device that I could use for both school and work. However, it just turned off 10 days after it arrived and refused to  turn on again. We sent it back to the ACER company (it told us to send it back to ACER inside the package) we had to pay for shipping but they fixed it. When it returned  the  message inside the box said it was just below 1% and had to be charged for a while before turning on again. I was happy to see that the problem was minor, or at least it seemed minor. One week after the computer was sent  back to me, it stopped working for the second time in 25 days.

Chromebook Screen Goes Black-Needs Chrome OS Recovery,"I purchased this item a little over a month ago.  The other day the screen went black. The power was on but the computer could not get past the black screen.  I googled the issue and found that many people have this problem with this Acer Spin 311 Chromebook.  Pressing Esc, Refresh and the Power button at the same time turned the computer on but gave me an error that the Chrome OS system was gone and needed to be recovered.  In order to fix this you have to install Chrome OS onto a flash drive, using a different Chromebook, and then reinstall the Chrome OS onto your Acer Chromebook.  Which by the way, resets your computer back to the factory reset.  You lose everything.  After going through all that it took to restore the computer two days ago, it happened again today!

An impressive laptop considering the price,"I picked up one of these on a cyber Monday deal, and it's my second Acer. The first was a real workhorse so I felt safe with the brand, and sure enough I love this one too. I use it mainly for word processing, and for those purposes it gets the job done nicely. I love the keyboard, and I love how light this laptop is. The trackpad works smoothly too. Those are pretty much the most important features for me. The screen is plain old HD, but you can't have everything at that price point and type is still reasonably crisp. It has a Micro SD card slot, the keyword there being Micro. I had a bunch of SD cards but had to shell out for a Micro SD, although it wasn't very expensive. I'm not sure how much I will flip it into tablet mode and use that, but it's nice to know the option is there. If I had to nitpick I'd say that I don't like that the Acer logo is so prominent in the bezel, or that it says Corning Gorilla Glass at the top of the screen--I don't need logos and type drawing my focus when I'm on task. A little black tape fixed that. But overall I couldn't be happier with this excellent and affordable Chromebook!",Stephen de las Heras,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on December 5, 2021",

Great deal!,chaos so I bought this on prime week last week and I was like $500 but I got it for under 250 which is a steal for most of y’all know that these laptops are expensive. I just got it two days ago. The package came on time and no damage at all. I did use Amazon prime for my shipping so it has fast shipping. The touchscreen is really cool and it works very well it doesn’t lag or glitch so far. The computer charges fast the battery life seems to last really long I’ve been on it for four hours plus messing with the computer and the battery life has it drained 10% yet. I bought the laptop for school and office work and it is very easy downloading the apps that you need using it for college assignments. I very much recommend this to college students and people who work in an office. The security settings are 100% and will always notify you so far if something is off or you something that you didn’t approve shows up and pops up. so far I like this computer a lot I’m gonna give it 4 1/2 stars just because I don’t know everything yet because it’s been two days I will keep everyone posted of my review after 30 days!,Naomi W,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on July 1, 2021",

Shipping was STUPID FAST, ordered it Saturday night and received it Monday out here butt-shuck nowhere, Wyoming. So, ya know, impressive.

I was not a fan of the aspect ratio of the screen,"The reported dimensions of this screen are pretty deceptive. What you actually receive is one of the more narrow aspect ratios of usable screen space I have ever seen in a touchscreen device. The screen is also pretty dark even at the brightest level compared to my other tablets and laptops. Trying to use it in tablet mode with how average website are designed was pretty impossible with the aspect ratio making the screen so narrow and long. It is not intuitive at all and felt quite a bit like looking at a small phone since the ratio made the text appear pretty small to compensate for the width limitation in tablet mode.  I bought it as a gift for someone and was so put off by how it looked in tablet mode and the incredible cheap plastic built with large seams on the body all over the place ready to pop open, that I returned it for something more solid and honest about screen quality.",Mishka Haznor,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on July 18, 2020",4 people found this helpful

If you just log it takes you back to the start screen but i like to turn my computers off when i'm not using them.

Best of All Worlds,"Purchased this as a Christmas present for my daughter and, frankly, I am a little a jealous. I bought a tablet long ago that I have barely used.

This is every bit as good as a tablet but with a good keyboard and ability to stand upright on it's own (again, obvious, but having it rest on your lap vs holding a tablet is no competition for practicality). I just don't know why anyone would get a tablet when you could get this. It's versatile, portable, and durable.

INACCURATE DESCRPTION IS not touchscreen or flipable to a tablet.,like the title says it is not a touch screen and cannot fold to a tablet just a laptop with chrome os and it cant use the Netflix app because one of the parts it uses isn't approved buy the google app store. I even saw another guy in his review say the same thing but I figured it was some mistake because the price was so good but you get what you pay for. but if you don't mind it not being a touch screen or able to fold to a tablet or not being able to have the Netflix app[ Can use on the Netflix website but then you cant download anything for offline use which is a big reason I wanted a chrome book} its a alright Chromebook at best but people can buy what ever they want. I also left a review that was not approved because they are trying to hide there false advertisement which is not ok ever in my book.

Good power, good battery, USB-C ports and power, micro-SD port, great touch screen, etc.  My only dislikes are the lack of a lighted keyboard and wasted screen real-estate of the unusually wide bevels.

Not my first Chrome Book,"This is my third Chromebook, I bought one shortly after they came out, I beat the daylights out of the first one and reluctantly moved on when the battery wouldn't hold a charge after 5 years or so. The second one didn't get used as much, and again declining battery life led me to retire it. This one is fine.  I like the compact size and relative lightness of this design.  It does all of the basic web-functions, and Chrome has an app that does most office functions. I recently linked it to my I-cloud account, and now I have access to thousands of photos stored in the cloud.  I like the style, I like the design, battery life is decent.  The touch screen was the biggest change over the previous, and it is handy.  What does this do that an I-Pad doesn't, the integrated keyboard.

"Great Laptop for the Money, ACER Nitro 5","This ACER Nitro 5 I received is a terrific laptop; granted, I'm not super hip on all the latest and greatest on a laptop, but what this laptop does do is the keyboard feel is good, the build quality is fairly solid, there's a separate numerical keyboard, and it works like it should, meaning no blue screen of death and glitches.  The model I bought does have a backlit keyboard, but it is only backlit in red; this model does not have the multiple different colors.  Next, the 16 GB of RAM, it is configured in two sticks of 8 GB.  So, if one (like I did...) buy another single 16 GB RAM stick expecting to upgrade to a total of 32 GM of RAM, nope.

For the most part, this computer has handled running them all super well. Surprisingly, it has the most difficulty with the in-browser games, which tend to lag or drop frames. To be fair, I don't really know why Mahjongg 3D needs to be rendered in such intense detail anyway, but whatever.",Robyn Johnson,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on August 17, 2022",33 people found this helpful

good value,"I picked this up for lower end internet gaming, and am typing the review on it now.  Performance is peppy, solid wifi, nice display and good quality components.  On the pro side, I like the feel of the keyboard, and that the setup was pretty quick and painless - I was on line in an hour, so not bad at all.  On the con side, this thing gets HOT on my lap while playing games, enough so that I got out a laptop cooling pad.  It has the usual bloatware that you always get on these consumer grade machines, but it was surprisingly easy to get rid of.  I suspect the image was several months old, since I had to go through a couple of cycles of Windows updates to get current, but all the drivers were up to date and I had no issues getting updates to apply.  I charged it up before using it and got four hours on a charge, even with all the downloads and rebooting several times, and it charged up to full again in less than an hour while I was using it, so the battery is acceptable.

Its out-of-the-box specs are underwhelming, but some can be upgraded, like RAM and hard drive space. The RTX 3050 is the cheapest house in the fancy neighborhood. It’s a solid starter GPU for current games, but temper your frame rate and detail expectations. The Comet Lake i5 CPU is capable, but can run hot. Get used to the fans.

It has a great read and write speed when downloading games or files. The games run smoothly - modern warfare, etc. The hard drive space is good for the average person, but if you want to have multiple files and games you’ll need an external drive. The biggest plus is the battery port in the back, which is way easier to use than the side ports a lot of laptops have. Overall this computer works well for the price ( less than $900).

If asked to do realistic tasks its a power house.,Keep expectations realistic do your research for what kind of games your gonna play how this hardware stacks up to running sed games and your gonna have a good time and be happy with your buy. The only ball drop by Microsoft or Acer was i had to download some additional C++ code to get some games running how they should. I play fighting games and this laptop suits my needs and runs the games without issue should also be enough to handle street fighter 6 with no issues playing more demanding games performance may decline. You also need to understand you absolutely will not be gaming without being plugged into the charger you will just gimp the component's if you don't play plugged into a outlet and have a bad time. Make sure you set up the PC to optimize performance and take full advantage of its dedicated nividia card and intel processor the ram can be upgraded but i would only put 16gigs in max the 8 gig stick is okay. The native 144hz screen is impressive for the price this laptop costs all in all if you know what your doing and know how games will run on the hardware that you want to play you will be happy with the buy.

I have a coolpad for this and my room is literally cold not blazin hot but yeah the cpu will hit 90 degrees! The gpu temps are always fine but the cpu sucks so hard so no wonder fortnite is unplayable.

I kid you not i play almost every game nearly max with optimizations done at that 144 fps and i have used programs to see my avg so yeah.

Great for getting started on PC gaming but...,"So, I got this laptop so I could start pc gaming for the first time, and I love it so far.

I've tried calibrating the battery(No flash for 2 days), battery resetting(No flash for 10 hours), unplugging the battery(No change). None of these things would get that darn light to stop flashing. So, to remedy this issue, I've changed the battery. Low and behold, it never has flashed orange since. First thing I recommend with this laptop is change the battery ASAP for two reasons. 1.

nice budget gaming laptop,"Acer has been a big competing brand on par with Dell, Asus, HP, etc... In the recent year, they've ventured in gaming laptop and actually becomes one of the leading budget gaming laptop maker. Though I haven't been playing game for a while, I decided to pick this up after reading rave reviews about it online and I must admit that it's a very good gaming laptop and comes at a very affordable price, just shy of one grand. The red accent lighting on this laptop make it looks very intimidating but also very stealthy (black on read lettering). I like that all the ports (HDMI, USB, Type C, RJ45, etc...) are placed on the sides, and only the power adaptor port is in the back, which makes lot more sense. The 15.6"" screen is decent for some games but not ideal, however, having a smaller screen makes it more versatile and lighter to bring around. The screen has awesome graphic, super bright, colorful and sharp images. This laptop runs on the 11th gen of core i7 CPU, plus its GeForce RTX 3050 Ti makes it a beast of a gaming laptop to play Word of Warcrafts. I haven't tested it on those first person shooter game (not a fan) so I can't vouch for those games, but I'd definitely buy this again or recommend it to any of my friends (in my WoW guild). Awesome gaming laptop at a very affordable price!!!",WinWin,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on June 16, 2022",2 people found this helpful
Great screen and processor but upgrade your RAM,"In terms of gaming, this laptop is on the low-end.

Acceptable for the price; weak battery and fans,"Overall, this is a nice budget gaming laptop. I purchase this it replace my previous M..S..I.. as the keys were popping off of that one from tons of use. While the screen is large and the image quality much better on this Acer, that's about where it ends. The battery on this thing is awful, even with battery efficiency settings when performing basic functions like browsing the web. The Acer Cool fans are a joke -- I hit my thermal load on this laptop quicker than I ever have in my life with any gaming laptop. I played Civ VI on this thing for less than an hour, and that's about all it could handle. I did, however, purchase a separate cooling pad, and it seems to have remedied the problem. Overall, if you can get this at a discount (like I did on Prime Day), it's worth it, but not for full price.

Too many issues,"I bought this laptop both for college and gaming, but the amount of issues it came with makes it annoying to use. First of all, when I came it wouldn't turn on or charge (yes the charger had clicked but still nothing). I contacted acer and they told me to send it over for check up, I couldn't because I needed it for college so I asked for a refund but it wasn't going through so I had to wait a few days to see if I could get one. The laptop ended up charging so I decided to not return it (which I regret). Soon after, (like not even a day after) this glitch would randomly appear multiple times and it was annoying. The bottom of the screen would multiply, go in up and down motions, and vibrate through the whole screen and it just wouldn't stop doing it for a few seconds/minute. Knowing that they would have just told me to send it over, I sucked it up even though it would get worse every time. Secondly, the battery life. It really does suck, it never lasts more than 2 hours even when I'm just doing assignments in Word. And when gaming it won't even last an hour. Thirdly, it's supposed to be for gaming but it lags and it's slow even when I'm just using Google or doing assignments. It literally takes so long to load, games are laggy, etc. I expected a 16 RAM, i7 processor to at least run a roblox game, but no. It lags to even that. Fourthly, the charging port broke. It started having issues to charge again, sometimes it would stop charging. Not long after, it completely stopped charging so I assumed it was the charger so I bought a new one (which was $50) just to find out the charger wasn't the issue. Now, it charges if the charger is at a specific position, move it a little and it'll stop charging.",Valeria,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 15, 2022",

Great laptop for gaming and 3d work cons very little vr support,"I love this laptop, I push my laptop pretty hard, I use Blender, Daz3d and a few other software's for 3d modeling and rendering. this laptop can handle it pretty well. with blender cycles I could do optiX gpu rendering. in Daz Studio I was able to get a decent render using Nivdia iray with pretty good real time feed back. for games I was able to play Planetside 2 at a pretty good resolution at a good frame rate probably not like 120 fps on ulta high but it didnt dip below 30. with two m.2 drives on the bottom and a full ssd slot as well (cable is included so if you buy second hand watch out) I was able to get good storage. ram is upgradeable to 32 gbs which in the end is a pretty strong work horse. upgrading it was a bit scary as its not under the keyboard you have to take the bottom off and use a thin of plastic guitar pick or ifixit to open it up. go onto YouTube to watch a break down, its not to hard to upgrade. batter life is not great but you could tailor it by having it turn off lights and lower screen brightness. built in Bluetooth and full ethernet port 2 usb 3 ports and one usb c. which brings me to my con and that is very little vr support. I played vr games on a even older graphic card than this, and yet this RTX 3050 has no display port or a fast enough usb c to support an adapter. I cant say about the quest but I have a rift s and it will not work on this laptop.  if you are looking for a mid workstation laptop this might fill the bill, if you are looking to get this for an artist going into school this one would be a good deal with the dedicated gpu this will extend the life of this computer to be able to handle most 3d and 2d applications.",Dustin Meyer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on December 17, 2021",8 people found this helpful

Amazing budget laptop,"This laptop is 100% worth the money. I did a lot of research into many many different laptops, specifically in the $600-$900 range, and this was the one I went with. And I’m very glad I did. I bought it mainly for gaming and it works like a charm. Just some examples: 150+ FPS on Fortnite with high performance graphics, 250+ FPS on Rocket League with high performance graphics, 300+ FPS on Minecraft (default “fancy” graphics), 200+ FPS on Forza Horizon with high graphics. I’ve had absolutely no problems with it as far as gaming goes, and it works great for any daily work you may want to use it for. Note that I did add an extra 8gb of crucial ram into the open slot, which does improve performance. The only slight issue it has is that the fans can be a bit loud for more intensive games or programs. However, that’s the case for many budget gaming laptops. Some good headphones will do the trick if it gets to be a problem. But like I said, this laptop is exactly what I was looking for and if you’re looking for a good gaming laptop in the $800 price range, this is it.",Godofsleep,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on January 2, 2022",One person found this helpful

Runs Sims 4 beautifully!,"I’m in love with this laptop. I was looking for a review about running the sims 4 with a lot of packs but now that I have it, i’ll say it. This laptop runs the Sims 4 on Ultra graphics with all of the packs and tons of CC and mods BEAUTIFULLY.  It doesn’t miss a single beat. Loads in less than 30 seconds, and that’s only with 8 gb of RAM. The screen quality is so nice too, it looks like it has an overlay almost. It starts up quickly, loads web pages super fast. I can see myself thoroughly enjoying watching movies on this laptop even. I don’t know how it compares to other gaming or high end laptops, but if you’re like me and you have a piece of crap laptop and you’re used to it taking almost an hour to load the Sims on medium graphics, you will be BLOWN AWAY. The laptop is super light and thin. The keyboard has a nice feel to it, i like the back light but i wish you could change the color. I played with it for 6 hours straight and the fans are super quiet, and it doesn’t heat up that much at all. It does slow down a little without being hooked up, but i don’t plan on using it portably so I can’t speak to that. This was worth every penny, and I’m really grateful for Acer packing so much power at a good price.

Able to Hold its Own Against Gaming Machines that Cost Twice as Much,"I spent several weeks with this laptop before sitting down to review it. My conclusions are that for the price-point asked for it, which incidentally is less than what it was when it first arrived at my place, it's well worth the money. The graphics card delivers images and a gaming experience as good as machines I have that costs several hundred dollars more than this one. For me this the essential feature of a gaming laptop and this one passes that test with flying colors. My most demanding games performed without glitches, sputtering or any of the other problems that arise from inadequate graphics functionality. Speed on gaming and all other activities on this device leave nothing to complain about. The screen here provides crisp, clear images, another plus for demanding gaming in which partly hidden features during play need to be identified and engaged. Conversely, however, the sound card could be better. This card can deliver uneven sound-effects when gaming, though it's fine for watching movies or streaming. RAM can be upgraded though I see no need to do so at this point. The casing for this device is strong even though this machine is thinner and sleeker than my other gaming laptops, so much so that I'd feel comfortable using it in a business setting; something I would not do with my other gaming machines which look too much like they're designed for fun and games rather than a professional environment. This is a very fast and responsive piece of equipment, essential for a good gaming experience and something I would want anyway from any computer. My bottom line is that you get an exceptional bargain with this machine priced at just under $900 as of this writing in late July 2021. I'd definitely recommend it for those looking for a good gaming device capable of handling demanding play at a more affordable price.",J.

Excellent Value Gaming Laptop,"Good sub-$1000 gaming laptops are hard to find, but The Nitro 5 gives great value without breaking the bank.  The 10th Gen Core i5 processor is 2 generations old at this point, but it has plenty of power to run pretty much all modern games at a decent setting.  The Nvidia RTX 3050 graphics processor is an entry level to the new Ray-Tracing sexiness that's the next big thing in graphics.  On newer games you probably won't be able to get past the 60fps barrier at 1080p with the settings cranked, but dialing the details down a bit will give you better rates. The display is rated for 1080p and 144hz, and while it's not the brightest or most vibrant screen out there, it's fine for this price point.  There is also a (full size) HDMI out, but I have not had occasion to connect this to an external monitor yet.  The cooling fans do a good job of keeping this machine within temp specs... but do note they can get pretty loud under load (honestly that's almost inevitable on a gaming laptop, it's hard to keep things cool in such a small box.

computer is faster than a I7-3770k but starting instructions are poor.,"Many people have complaints about the computer not working upon arrival. The quick start manual does cover the problem of putting in the power plug. You need to follow those simple directions. The complaints about the microphone or the headphone port not working are due to the default windows 11 software settings.  You need to mess about with various settings to get them to work.  This information should be in the startup guide.  There is also a user manual that can be downloaded from Acer. The manual has some good points but needed to go into more depth. Some folks complain about the product being damaged in transit.  The box that the computer comes in is of good quality (perhaps it has been recently improved)..  The outer package (the one that Amazon provides) needs more protective foam or bubble wrap around the computer box. Some people complained in other reviews about the heat output from the computer -- it runs so hot that they needed a cooling mat. In normal operation the variable speed cooling fans ('coolboost') seem to do a good job of handling the heat. However, if you are running computer calculation intensive programs you will need to look for a cooling mat. You can easily tell when the computer is getting too hot -- the cooling fans speed up and you can feel the heat coming out of the exhaust ports. In normal operation the computer draws about 65 watts and in heavy use it is less than 100 watts. ALERT: The ""coolboost"" software works for Windows 10 but as soon as you update to Windows 11 the software stops working. I called the Acer repair service and they said that the problem will be fixed in an update but that update is not going to be available until April. The power supply is a ""stepmode"" type and that is very good if you need to run your computer ""off the grid.""  The power supply works with voltages from 100VAC to 220 VAC and from 50 to 60 cps.  The stepmode power supply can deal with the rather high total harmonic distortion (THD) produced by a standby generator.

Great upgradeable budget gaming laptop - but some tricks you need to know with Linux,"Me and my husband decided to get this laptop as he needed a more powerful PC for his old Macbook used for web development and programming and I wanted to have something that we could use to game with on the go. None of us have bought a new laptop in many many years, let alone a gaming laptop vs a business oriented laptop or budget/lightweight laptop. This seemed like a great compromise between new tech/hardware, easily upgradable in terms of ram, and something that wasn’t super super flashy or expensive. We’ve never had a PC with some of this hardware on it but we both were familiar with it in any case. We both spent the last two months with it to get an idea of the feel for this laptop in different use cases and so on.",The Artist Formerly Known as ʢ,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on September 17, 2021",5 people found this helpful

Not really designed as a good gaming laptop.,"I bought this laptop under the impression that it was VR Ready (according to some sources the new versions are.) This is Not True.

It is disappointing because i bought this so when i moved id have my index to socialize with friends. Either the laptop industry, or the VR industry need to decide which types of ports should be standard. Because ive noticed a trend of ""VR Ready"" Laptops that are no where close to ""VR Ready"" false advertising at its finest.

"Looked good on paper, but underperformed","Bought this to play games with friends since GPUs are astronomically overpriced and this laptop was extremely underwhelming. The screen is very dark and the colors are so muddled and muted. I expected more from a 144hz display. The GPU could barely handle running call of duty on the lowest settings at 1080p. The biggest downfall however is the SSD storage space.

Battery Issues,"The laptop would not charge when it arrived.  This was not an issue with inserting the cable incorrectly as others have mentioned, but a battery issue.  The laptop ran fine at first when connected to AC power, but would not actually charge the battery and would die when unplugged even after leaving to charge for hours before startup.  The computer would think it was charging and the LED charging indicator would be lit, but it was not.  I tried all of the typical software fixes like removing and re-installing the batter drivers, but it was a hardware issue.  I was able to boot up from AC connection, but after trying to install the first round of software updates the laptop would not turn back on as it required 25% battery reserve to complete the update and turn back on, which obviously was not possible.

"Great value gaming laptop, with some standard laptop tweaks","This is my newest laptop since 2017, but the laptop I had was from 2016. Far faster than my old one (of course) and runs every program to its max. For gaming a 3050 ti is limited to mostly 1080p gaming unless you play some of the lighter games where you can eek out 144op, but you can easily get 120fps on most games with some tweaks with around 70 to 90 fps on larger AAA titles. One of the first things you have to do with any Acer laptop is go into control panel and change the power settings, they come standard with USB and HDD/SSD auto power off which pretty much puts your laptop to sleep whether you change sleep settings or not. Also, press the (N) button by the num pad, click on the gear icon, and click to make the keyboard backlight stay on. I read some reviews online that said the keyboard backlight would turn off automatically, luckily my last laptop was a Acer predator and they have the same settings basically. Fans are almost non existent when just browsing and you can control them (finally) when doing some intense gaming (or using programs like CAD or the like). Also, the power cord is a dual step process, the first click means nothing, you have to push in till you hear a second click. I was looking for a 17"" inch laptop with more than 2 USB A ports, those ports NOT on the right side (mouse interference), could game at atleast 1080p/above 60 fps, a better processor, and had a ethernet port. Sounds like alot but most laptops are 15"" inch with 2 USB A ports and no ethernet ports now. I'm satisfied with this purchase.",Maurice A.

Best bang for your Buck,"Good laptop, this i5 10300 H and RTX 3050 is a great combination add a extra stick of ram make sure it’s @2933 and you should be okay. I would suggest just buying a duel channel kit of Corsair vengeance @ 2933 just to make sure the ram dimms work together probably. You can always add more storage later as Acer acutely advertises right on the laptop itself you can basically open it and add more at any time you see fit. For games like WoW open world 89-144 fps out questing. PvP epic or random around a average in the 90s fps with medium/high settings can handle being upscaled in game to 1440p with a small performance hit. But is great at 1080p seeing it’s a smaller screen resolution @ 1080p looks amazing. color is a tad lack luster but not a dealbreaker by any means at this price point does well with fallout series and other games as well. I honestly did not expect this to perform as well as it does. Honestly I think it’s handles games just as well as a gtx 1070 or in at or right under 1660ti desktop version. The 4GB v ram is not going to be able to handle ultra setting in most newer games. but with the smaller screen turning down certain settings are going to get you great performance With almost no visual quality loss. I would take higher refresh rate over higher resolution any day certain games you may not be able to achieve the 144hz but anything over 60 is going to stay buttery smooth. You will have one extra nvme ssd slot under the one in use I do believe that can handle up to a 2TB drive and a 2.5 sata drive slot as well. I Iiked it so much my girlfriend wanted a laptop and I couldn’t justify buying anything less even though she only plays sims 4. I can’t bring myself to buy anything in the 600 to 700$ range that only runs on integrated graphics it’s just not worth the money.",Dpcunning,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on December 5, 2021",28 people found this helpful

Good specs for the price but the display is unacceptably bad.,"For a budget gaming laptop, this Acer Nitro 5 has good enough specs, the Core i5 and the RTX 3050 are sufficient.

Not what i was expecting.,"As someone who knows his way around computers after building several, knowing the market inside and out for prices on each components for just about anything. Seeing this made me gasp thinking it was a good deal when it was on sale for 850 US. i was so wrong. A 3050 with a miserable 10300h at 8gb at 2933 was a horrible combination. it is hard to just play simple high giving fps games like fornite, pubg, rocket league and many more. the only game i would cap out at 144 is rocket league and even then it would flicker every now and then to 90 or so. but other games at LOW texters no shadows whatever it may be, bottom of the barrel low barley gives you 60 and half the time your playing at 40fps. this is a honest review and i should have spent the extra hundred on something like a tuf laptop with a 17inch and better specs. this is not the computer for any real gaming. also when you receive the computer at ""256gb"" you realistically only get 180 because windows takes about 70-80 gigs just downloading. the drivers for this gpu is horrible at the moment and is bottlenecked by the absolute worst cpu i have ever used. every game is full load on gpu while the cpu cant push anything and dont think about overclocking because this computers psu wont allow it because its so bare minimum with the voltage that you cant touch anything about it besides upgrading the ram. dont go with this laptop is is HORRIBLE.",dew,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on May 27, 2022",One person found this helpful

Did not function as would be expected.,"Received the item.  Unpacked and set it up per the guidelines.  The performance of the hardware seemed pretty good.  The cooling fans seemed to spin up loudly often when running some software.  Installed a widely known gaming platform on the laptop, assuming that a ""gaming"" laptop would by default be able to load it and the games that run under it.  When I would try to run half of the games,  games icons simply showed in the icon bar and then disappear and the applications not load.  Finally one applications errored a visible message stating it could not be run from a hypervisor.  I went to a command line and found the OS stating that there was a hypervisor installed.  So, I attempted to go and uninstall the OS standard hypervisor.  But, it did not show as installed in the OS menus.  I don't know if this was a factory configuration or some post-factory add.  But, a gaming laptop should not have any issue with running gaming applications.  Very disappointing to have such issues with a brand new device.

Fast laptop with horrible colors and speakers,"I had a great MSI Dominator for nearly 8 years.  It was showing it's age so I went shopping for a new laptop.  I found this Acer Nitro 5 and decided to buy it as it was quite a bit less money than a new MSI.  It's a zippy laptop loaded with Windows 11, plenty of SSD storage and ram.  But the Nvidia Geforce RTX graphics card is a POS.  The colors are wrong, for instance, bright red has this rust color to it.  bright greens look more like olive green.  Worse, there is no way to fix it I can find.  The latest drivers from Nvidia are installed.  I have scoured the internet for a solution and there appears to be none other than return it and buy another brand.  There is no way to increase color intensity or saturation.

Since the beginning I only ran a few games (Halo Infinite and Destiny) because the storage is a huge limitation, but after a few months I bought an extra ssd plus 8gb for ram and the results are really admirable. Must games run smoothly at high definition (not top but four out of five) and in some more demanding games you can still play in good quality.

The fact of the matter is you are only able to actually use less than 100 gb which you have to really pay attention to other wise your storage will cap.

That the laptop actually works properly.,"Con. Okay so I ordered this laptop for my daughter's birthday. So on day one I told her it will not turn on till you charge it so first thing she did was plugged it in and let it charge a few moments later we powered it up and my daughter was super excited so she went on to download a game she likes to play online. So the next day she goes to play the game and the screen froze shortly into the game so first thing was to wait to see if maybe it was lag but after a minute or so nothing still froze. Mouse didn't move so next I pushed alt, control, delete. Nothing so the ESC and nothing then the windows key. So I powered it down and powered back up keyboard lights up but no display so I hold the power key down for 15 seconds nothing. So I decided to power down again and power up and nothing but the keyboard powers up. So I this point I'm upset and my daughter is super bummed after being super happy and excited a moment ago .so I called costumer support and they let me know that my computer is under warranty and it can be taken care of but I get cut off and I'm running late for work so I decided I'd call back after work. So I called again and talked to costumer support again so went through the same conversation and then they said they could refund my money or replace it I optioned for a replacement they said ok but because of the price there supervisor would have to ok it I said ok so after about ten minutes on the phone the till me that there supervisor can't ok the transaction that they have to wait for the morning supervisor to do this I said fine and that I would be contacted the next day....... Well it's been so it's been 4 days and nothing I'm starting to feel scammed by Amazon for some reason. So in my opinion stay away from this laptop and DO NOT BUY ANY Electronics from AMAZON.",JD,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on July 25, 2022",7 people found this helpful

Can't be unplugged,In less than 6 months time this laptop will not function unless it's plugged in. It doesn't even take a few seconds it will die INSTANTLY the second it is unplugged from power.  I bought this laptop to trade stocks while my other laptop was being repaired (which is about 6 years old and still functions better than this even before being repaired....) and the only thing I've had open was chrome. Looks like I can't readily swap a battery out either which shouldn't even have to be done after 6 months.  If there is no warranty I'll probably just sell it somewhere with my receipt attached of this new laptop and share the glory of ACER with the next lucky winner.,GiveMeCoffee,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 16, 2022",

Very good for the price :),"This is my first laptop after a decade and I am very happy to purchase this one. So many good words about Nitro 5s, even this one is not one of the better ones, I added another 8Gb ram and 2 TB 2.5 SSD to make it bit more usable. Not that anything wrong with 8Gb ram and 256Gb SSD but 8Gb rams are not that expensive at all these days.. I had 2TB SSD from my big computer, just switched it over. Talking about upgrading the laptop, it's so easy. Comes with everything you need to add another 2.5 SSD. YouTube videos helped me out though, made my job a lot easier. This computer does play FPS games, and plays them very smooth. The fans start running though, and you might think it's overheating, that's not the case, it's normal. They don't go full speed. I also play mobile games and stream through laptop... no heating no fan issues at all... it's like so smooth and easy for the machine. For this price, I highly recommend it, if you are in a tight budged like I am.

I was one of those people that ignored technical issues such as these because they have never happened to me.

"Arrived today, running quick and smooth so far","I see a lot of people complaining about the disk space and yeah, it’s low for a gaming laptop but I just got me a 1tb m.2 ssd for $126 so I’m not complaining. Even with 8gb Ram it seems to run smooth and work well also (though I am upgrading to 32gb). I can’t comment on the gaming bc I can’t install a real game until my ssd upgrade comes in but I’m hopeful and I’m happy thus far. It is important to note that to charge you have to push the cable in kinda hard until you hear the click sound, otherwise it doesn’t charge. It took me a few minutes to figure that out. Also, not a lot of bloatware installed so that’s good too; it’s unnecessary to use Norton when you have Windows Defender so I’d uninstall it along with Dropbox. Laptop isn’t very heavy and to keep it that way I’m opting to not use the HDD bay and instead just use m.2 ssd instead. This seems like a quality product so far so hopefully it lasts as long as my last Asus laptop did (6+yrs & still going). Wish a Blu-ray drive was included but not a deal breaker as you can buy an external slim one for around $100. Highly recommend this system so far, just know you’re going to need to upgrade the storage immediately before playing storage heavy games like WoW, COD, etc hence 4/5 stars.",Saint Trapthony,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on January 31, 2022",One person found this helpful

The cons,aka thing I don't care for. The power adapter for this Acer Swift is very small and delicate,  the Ram is soldered on so if the Ram gives you issues its not as easy as popping in a new stick, it comes with more bloat ware apps installed than my last OEM laptop and lack of any additional inputs, besides the 2 USB, 1 USB c HDMI, and a headset port. Overall I like the laptop, but soldering on the Ram sucks, and give me another USB at least 3 should be a minimum to call this a ""creator"" laptop.

"Small, fast and powerful.","It’s small, lightning fast and powerful. It gets insanely hot when running anything gpu intensive but a laptop fan will help it cool down. It runs smaller games like Terraria, Stardew Valley and Starbound with ease. It could definitely run new titles with lowered settings but I have not tried it yet. Temps are in the normal range even when it heats up. I recommend getting a 65W usb-c charger instead of using the charger it comes with. The one it comes with is a little flimsy and I feel like it’ll break with extended use. It doesn’t offer that many ports so I got a j5create usb-c multi adapter which helps a lot.

Powerful machine for creators,"I wanted a windows machine with discrete graphics and a quality display for photo and video work but I didn't want some 15.6-17"" behemoth, nor could I really afford a Razer or some other $2000 ultra portable. After exhaustive research and comparisons over a couple of months I decided the swift x was exactly at the price/performance intersection for me. It's a little thicker and heavier than I prefer for travel but given the massive performance it has over my old Yoga laptop I consider it a reasonable trade. The 16:10 display is not my preferred aspect ratio for lightroom and photoshop but I use a calibrated 4k external monitor for serious work sessions. The built in display has great gamut and color space specs and sharp details for a 1080 panel. Battery life is excellent if you're not flogging it. The fan ran an obnoxious amount out of the box, even at idle but a quick Google showed it was a known issue and a quick settings change quieted things right down. I haven't done much video work on it yet but I have some upcoming projects that will put the GPU to the test. It rips through lightroom and photoshop tasks with ease. It nips at the heels of my friend's top of the line Razer at a fraction of the price, and that's an Intel machine. If we got into multicore video work I would probably edge him out.",Negative459,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on May 19, 2022",

"Works pretty well, decent specs, unsure if you can really upgrade it","I will put this first. I am unsure if the ram or solid state drive is set or if you can upgrade them. I did not try to open or upgrade the item. These are the two things you should research before purchasing this. Although with the current specification, I am sure you do not need to do that. This Acer laptop overall is an average size laptop and the specification are not bad for what you get. This laptop is relatively thin and not too heavy. It has a decent processor (ryzen 7). The ram is 16 gb which is well beyond the suggested nowadays. It will definitely work for most daily usage as well as design and gaming. That being said, it is not the best in terms of battery life. It really only last about three to four hours at most on a full charge. The fan is a bit loud on heavy usage. It is a standard AC charger which can make it a bit annoying to replace in the future if needed. The power brick is okay but does get hot while charging. You will need it plugged in to really game on this device. Upon boot up of the acer laptop, the laptop boots up fairly quick. The setup is pretty straight forward and does not require any driver installation. The bloatware is not too terrible. The laptop also has only a 14 inch screen with the max resolution at 1920 x 1080. The screen has an okay brightness but not the best quality. It still keep the traditional two USB port as well so you do not have to buy an adapter for this laptop while also having the type c (non thunderbolt) port. The laptop can be angled back for better viewing but it cannot be pushed back all the way. The laptop surface where the wrist rest is where I do not like the material. It looks nice with the bright silver but with long term use it will fade over time. The keys are okay, but not the best. I am not a fan of typing on them as it just feels a bit on the cheaper end. The external casing of this surface is very easy to scratch (seems to be an issue with all this material) so I would recommend that you get a laptop case for it. The trackpad runs pretty well, It is sensitive and feels smooth to move across. It also does not look like it will wear down easily which is good. There is a camera that will record at at least 720p. You could put a web cam cover on it. The dual microphone makes for a very clear voice and I have not had any issues with any sound issues. It usually does not pick up too much surrounding noise and focuses more on voice. On laptop, there is a 3.5 port to plug in headphones/microphone. It does have dual band wifi built in and no issues with speed/connection. The laptop itself can last about five to six hours or so on a full charge. Depending on how much you have open and how much you utilize the laptop capability, you could actually have less than that. Best thing to do is just balance the resource as best you can. The overall charge time depends but it can take up to three to charge the laptop to 100% from what I can tell. It is not too long and the charger does get hot so handle with care. It has a decent boot up being less than fifteen seconds to boot up but the bloatware has to go so I would recommend you uninstall that if possible. The speaker system is pretty loud but they do have a bit of a feedback noise that is a bit annoying but that is okay. The 3060 TI runs great! It is a very powerful card that allows you to game very well on this computer although the screen is only 14 inches. The fan also is a bit loud on high usage (gaming). The processor is an Ryzen 7 which is MORE than enough power for what I need it to do on a daily. In terms of video games, it can play many games at very high quality although you do need to have it plugged in. The processing speed is really fast and it works really well for what I need. There is an HDMI port so you are able to connect this to an external screen. I am unsure if there is a dock that is meant for this laptop. Overall this laptop is a a very powerful laptop. You get a smaller screen but the gaming on it is not bad.  The acer laptop can run a bit hot and the battery life is not the best. The specification is not bad at 16 GB ram and 512 gb SSD drive. The space is decent for what I need it for but for gaming it will fill up fast. It is good for all around use and can easily be made into a work, gaming, or basic computer with a single monitor connection.",Xephz82,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 14, 2021",One person found this helpful

My review on this laptop,"I have been using this laptop for a month, temperatures can get pretty high under load. The highest it's been was 90 degrees celsius. If you plan to get this laptop I would suggest you get a laptop cooler. It helps and now the temperatures don't go higher than 80 degrees celsius. It was advertised for 11-hours of battery life but when I tested it, the battery held up to 9 hours of use which is pretty decent for a laptop. Be aware that the GPU RTX 3050ti uses 40 watts of battery, which is a lot. So if you plan to game, the battery would last for 3-5 hours. Its performance has been remarkable and I suggest this laptop for students and people who want to do a little gaming. It did disappoint that it was a 60-hertz display. The computer is powerful so I hoped it had a 144 or 240hz display. Either way, this is a good laptop and if you are a gamer get a monitor that has a high refresh rate because I easily had 100fps+ on Valorant and Fortnite.

Also, I didn't have to deal with customs. My order was shipped by Amazon via UPS.",Ravindu,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on December 29, 2021",
You get what you're buying,"It's what you'd expect. Solid performance from the new, updated CPU/GPUs. I was looking for a more minimal looking laptop with these specs at this price point, and this sort of fit. The chassis is a little outdated in terms of it's design and the trackpad feels a little clunky, but overall a solid laptop.",Johnathan ,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on September 29, 2021",

Mediatek WiFi card is simply unreliable. So is Acer support.,"What's a laptop with a dead WiFi card ? An expensive paper weight. And it doesn't help when the manufacturer's website cannot identify their own product with the S/N or SNID. Acer is now on my business no-buy list. Decent NVIDIA/AMD power horse for architectural software, but when it fails and can't repair WiFi connectivity, it's just a kid's gaming trinket.",DenAli,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on April 2, 2022",3 people found this helpful

Good for its price,"The acer swift x arrived much earlier than the expected date, which, with the free shipping, was a very appealing trait. The laptop itself meets the standards, and surpasses some of the concerns. The pluses include, small size, dedicated graphics, AMD and NVIDIA together, and moderate level internals. Some of the initial concerns were the display, which was said to be limiting and have issue with the color accuracy. With the laptop in hand, I would agree that the display isn't on par with some of the higher end laptops, but it fits my needs and is sufficient for browsing, gaming, or video playback. Another said concern was that the audio was lacking as well. My first hand experience leads me to agree with that statement, as the audio below 50 in the settings is hardly audible, meaning that the max audio is also lower that most competitor laptops. However, my solution was to wear headphones, as it works perfectly fine with them. Finally, the battery life was advertised to be 17 hours, which is obviously exaggerated given this laptop has a dedicated graphics card, but it seems to fall  shorter than expected. When the laptop puts to use the GPU, RTX 3050 ti, the battery life drops significantly to at most, 3 hours, at worst, 1 and a half. While normally browsing and video playback, the battery life lasts at most 13 hours on battery saver and 7 on the median battery options.",Talia I.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on July 26, 2021",2 people found this helpful

For the pros, the display is very nice, it's comfortable to use and easy to get used to, and can handle some light work and the occasional game of Minecraft.  However, there are some issues.  This laptop has become fairly slow over time and it's often frustrating waiting for it to boot up for long periods of time.  Additionally the battery life isn't very good; when I first got it the life would survive for about 5 hours of casual youtube, and now it barely survives 2 hours of being asleep in my bookbag.  I wouldn't recommend this if you're looking for something that's long term quality, but if you just need something for here and now and plan on upgrading soon this could be fore you.",C,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on April 19, 2021",5 people found this helpful

Serviceable Solution,"We were looking to get a second laptop as the pandemic had pushed both my partner and I to be working from home. We weren't looking for anything fancy, but we needed more oomph than a Chromebook. This Dell fit the bill. It's not going to wow you, but it's got enough power to support web browsing, doc and presentation creation, and graphic design programs all at once. It moves along at a nice clip, as well. It's not incredibly heavy, but it's certainly not designed as a ""lightweight"" solution. My one real complaint is that the mouse touchpad is awkwardly positioned and configured, which can slow me down while I'm trying to switch between applications.

Small issues based on current chip shortage.,"The Dell model 3583 is specified (Dell Specs p.12) with an 8th generation Intel core i3, i5, or i7 CPU. I suspect due to the 'chip shortage' Dell was forced to dive into the ol' parts bin and ship this particular 3583 with an older - and MUCH lower specs - Pentium Gold 5th generation CPU with limited cache. To try to compensate, Dell also shipped this unit with a M.2 SSD rather than the spec'd spinning HDD.  That was very good of them. But the mis-match seems to be creating some lag in 'getting things done', although not critical. I may (probably) be wrong about this, but then I'm not a computer whiz. It would be great if Dell eventually tracked this order and in future shipped us a comparable Core i3 CPU with a realistic cache. Hey, I can dream! In addition - 3583 comes spec'd with Win 10 Home (not S mode). S mode sucks and the time it takes to dump it is a pain. 2cts.",John W.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on April 29, 2021",38 people found this helpful

This laptop is great if you want to get get work done and play some minecraft for a little bit. If you open up the back you can add an SSD and if you want you can replace the NVME it comes with for a 2280 nvme. It does also have replaceable memory so if you want to upgrade to dual channel you can. Now if you don't run it at at full brightness and settings you can get a pretty decent battery life out of it. So for average school work and for having work papers this is a great laptop.

"Great laptop for the price, even for entry level gaming.","I’m very happy with this laptop, I’ve had it like 2 weeks now and I’ve used it every single day. It arrived very quickly. It’s fast and it runs smoothly for everything from college programs, homework, web browsing, to even some gaming. I’ve not installed the extra stick of RAM yet as everyone has suggested, but even just with the 8gb I’ve been able to run some lower spec games. Games like Sims 3/4/city, Bethesda games, age of empires, ALMOST everything I’ve tried works and runs way better than my consoles. Whether you’re looking for a cheaper option for playing games (don’t expect crazy graphic or ultra settings), a school laptop, or if you upgrade the ram a decent laptop to run music recording software on, this is a good contender for the price. The only reasons I didn’t give it 5 stars are; the external hardware is nothing fancy, not bad quality just could be better, the battery is great for general use but for games it obviously drains fast, and the material the track pad is made of is not that great. Other than that, I have no complaints and I definitely recommend this laptop.",Logan Lotz,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on January 17, 2022",2 people found this helpful

Can you do better for less than $500? Probably not.,"This may be the best option available for less than $500 as of February 2022. It has decent battery life (7-8 hours), good performance, it’s portable, and upgradable (if you are skilled & careful). Perfect for a student or for business use. You will want to add RAM if you intend to do more than browse, office work, watch movies, etc. Be prepared to deal with Windows 11 (sigh) and some fan noise but that is common with AMD CPU’s and Windows brilliant fan control… Overall, I recommend it. I upgraded the memory and replaced the plastic around the CPU with thermal pads. However, I am familiar with upgrading and repairs. This will be my new productive laptop for work and coding.

Been 1 month & already a burned out pixel. Poor airflow. Don't plan on keeping it long. Warranty it.,"This doesn't have touch screen on my model. The FHD display really surprised me. It's better picture than a lot of these TVs. As with all products they hide the defects from you until a month later. As soon as the 33th day rolled on I turned on the laptop and discovered sure enough it's got a burnt pixel. No way to fix that without replacing the screen. Unless you have 5+ burned out pixels, good luck getting a return or any repairs. HP is still shady in that regard. I fully upgraded the machine when I got it. 16GB ram, 1TB Samsung 980 SSD. The performance actually is comparable to my tower in many respects. I have a Geforce 980, an octocore AMD CPU, and 24GB DDR3 ram in my tower. This laptop of course has a little less RAM, but it plays games about just as well as on my tower. I really am surprised at this. The cooling situation is absolutely garbage with this laptop. The engineers put the CPU exhaust port pointing directly into the hinge portion of the case. This makes it so the computer is actively fighting by blowing air into a 1/5 CM gap. There is just a row of holes in the bottle for air intake. I picked up a tray with a cooling fan pad and that solved the heat problem. I see it having problems in the future just because of how they designed the fan. The excess heat not only kills your hardware lifespan but it slows your machine down by auto throttling. If I could I would have installed heat spreaders all over the inside of this machine, but there just isn't room. They couldn't even be bothered to make the air inlets in the front of the case. It is asking to burn up after so many years deliberately. I had problems with HP in the past, they screwed up a laptop return I sent in, then blamed me for water damage when I had before and after pictures, so I'm not shocked at how they treat customers. I swore I'd not buy another HP but this one was just too cheap to pass up. It's super light weight. The camera is nothing fancy, in Windows 11, you will find you lack all of your audio enhancement options. It's instead been replaced by this crap HP audio tool. Ditch it as soon as you can and find something like Pulse audio so you can hear out of the cheap cheap cheap dog szzz cheap speakers. You'll also want to get a good set of headphones. The performance is a little low unless you do add that second stick of RAM as so many other people have pointed out. The machine simply wasn't designed properly, and they are taking it out of the consumers pocket by keeping them ignorant and not showing important aspects such as showing how the fan is smack dab in the middle of a 1/2cm gap. When you close the lid and open it after 20 minutes you'll find it's incredibly warm if you have it hooked up to HDMI. It forces you to keep the screen open, which isn't good to have static screens. I honestly think the burned out pixel happened just from the excess heat, but there isn't anything I can do about it. It isn't that bad, but once you see something you can never unsee it. I have a warranty but again, it's not going to cover this damage, so I spent money and not even 30 days later it has depreciated in value by the price of the LCD screen. The case is the cheapest plastic they could find. Given this was produced during the pandemic you're left with another problem. Check your RAM speeds. If you get stuck with a 1R16 chip you're basically having 1 librarian trying to organize 16 shelves, whereas the good ram 2R8 would be equal to 2 librarians keeping up with 8 shelves. Now you can see how the extra work load slows your machine. They don't mention this in their sales page or documentation, and you'll only find out AFTER you get it and run software to look at it, or pull the machine apart. Overall, I probably wouldn't buy this machine again, even though it works fast for an entry level computer. It's just too poorly designed. I give it a year or two before it fails. Most likely, knowing HP it will be 26 minutes after the OEM warranty expires. They used this planned obsolescence to rip off customers, and even though it's been nearly 8 years since I swore I wouldn't buy another one, they changed; for the worse.",shadowstar,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on April 5, 2022",30 people found this helpful

Surprisingly nice!,"So this was the first non high-end gaming laptop I've ever purchased, with the intent of using it as a cheap laptop to carry around for school, work, and general basic use. To be quite honest, it's surprisingly nice! After I got over the initial shock of downgrading to a 15"" display from my previous 17"", the screen is of good quality. The processing speed is not disappointing at all. The sound is great (it actually can get obnoxiously loud if you are into that). I don't find Windows 11 to be offensive to use. Keyboard is friendly. It seems to be built well and feels of decent quality (not super cheap feeling). It's light to carry. Loads videos and webpages quickly. No crashing or general use issues as of yet. I've even run the full Adobe Creative Suite on this thing and it's running just fine. I'm really pleasantly surprised. And coming from someone who is used to a 5k+ Alienware Gaming Laptop (aka me), the fact that I don't hate this thing is truly impressive enough. If you pressed me to find something I don't love about it, I'd say the fan seems to run more than expected and the battery life is meh. It gives you zero warning before just shutting off after dying. But after the panic subsided that I had just possibly lost all my work, I plugged it in and hit the power button, only to be giddy with happiness that it just booted up with all my web pages still loaded and logged in the way I left it. So I am not even mad. No touch screen on my model. And I can't attest to it's gaming abilities because, well, I have an Alienware for that.

Believe the NEGATIVE REVIEWS!,"I had high hopes because I didn’t see the reviews until after I made the purchase. At that point I could only hope I wouldn’t have the same Wi-Fi issues that most other people had complained about. But sure enough, the 2nd day, after the laptop installed updates, I could not get it to connect to wifi anymore. I rebooted and tried to fix it for a little while but after reading the reviews I tried no more troubleshooting as I already knew what to expect but just hoped for a different outcome. Sending the laptop back immediately and I will just go and purchase one in store that I won’t have to troubleshoot on day two. Do not waste your time with this laptop unfortunately.

The laptop arrived with a crack case,"We bought this computer to replace one that was ""irredeemable"". It has an i5 Intel processor which appears to be ten times faster than the i3.  I am not sure why the speed has increased, but we like it a whole lot better.  The only way we could make the old one useable was to leave it on 24 hours a day.  This computer closes down when we shut the lid and starts up when we lift it.  The only reason we bought this computer was to have a computer that is only used for financial matters----we do not search the web or receive e-mails.  The main reason we bought this laptop from Amazon was the 4 year extended warranty, which, I was told, included tech support.  We had a lot of problems with the last laptop, and needed tech support which was only good for one year.  (By the way, it is interesting that we enjoyed the last computer until one day Microsoft ""updated"" my windows 10 and then the computer stopped working.  I contacted Microsoft and told them how the computer worked fine until they ""updated"" my computer, and asked if they would fix it.  They said they would be glad to fix it for a $99 charge.  At that point I was loud and angry.  I explained that I felt that this was ransom ware.  ""You screwed up my computer and for $99 you will fix it"".  I said I would not pay such ransom ware money.  I would throw my computer away first and buy a new one.  I contacted Acer tech support and they said they would fix it for nothing.  They did, and when asked how I could keep this from happening again they said just unclick the ""automatic update button"".  I did just that and for 4 years I loved my computer again.)  An update to my review:  the laptop arrived with a crack on the face just to the left of the top left speaker.  I returned the computer to the supplier and they gave me credit for it minus $77.70 for a restocking charge.  No doubt they are restocking the computer so they can sell it to you and pull the same scam on you.-----------A further update on my refund----------The seller (Tech Deals Store) is refusing to refund all my money since I opened the box and started using it before I discovered the crack.  I have asked for a full refund, and am awaiting their answer.  If I don't receive my money then I will contact Amazon and ask them for the remainder off my refund.  If that doesn't work then I will file a dispute with my credit card company.  ( I am not letting Tech Deals Store get by with this scam.)  Further update---- Amazon gave me the $77.70 back.  I hope I remember the name ""Tech Deals Store"" and never buy from these people again.",Chubb,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on May 24, 2022",3 people found this helpful
I was nervous to buy a laptop off Amazon but it’s been great!,"Let me preface this by saying, I normally use a work laptop for everything so I know absolutely zero about computers. Recently I left my job and took some time off to find a new one and my old laptop died right before I was scheduled to have 5 interviews.  I went to Best Buy and talked with a sales guy and told him my budget and what I needed a laptop for (interviews, using Microsoft office suite, using my cricut) and he found this computer for me. It arrived in 1 day and was easy to set up. I love that there is an independent keypad for numbers. I got through multiple zoom meetings with no glitching. The battery life is great, it’s light weight, and is pretty fast when loading programs. I have zero complaints. There was a prompt about touch screen but I honestly didn’t know it came with one (if it does) so I’ll try that and edit my review.

Absolutely the worst purchase ever!,"I’m a college student and I purchased this computer about two weeks ago. The only purpose of this computer was to do homework, I don’t download games, I don’t even use social media on this computer, all I was supposed to do was homework.

It keeps shutting itself off and making loud and weird sounds, keeps showing a blue screen saying that “the device ran into a problem and it needs to restart”. I tried to contact customer support but they couldn’t help me at all, I was trying to do homework and all of a sudden (after about 25 mins of homework) a blue screen shows again saying it needs to restart and IT HAS BEEN STUCK at 43% for the past hour.

Worst keyboard I've ever seen on a laptop,"Unfortunately we got this as a gift for someone overseas, so unable to return it (or I would have). As others have mentioned, this keyboard has gray letters on silver keys. Almost no contrast unless you have perfect lighting (so in real life it often won't be anywhere as good as they picture they posted).  Unfortunately the first times I used it before sending it off was daytime with excellent lighting, so I managed to get by.  But in less than perfect lighting, it's a real strain to see the keys.  I searched in vain to see if they had backlight (which is the only thing that could have saved things).  Also, minimal tactile feedback. Unless you plan to always use an external keyboard, stay away from this laptop. Such a shame they never got user feedback on this keyboard design.",Jart76,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 11, 2022",

I am so happy with my purchase. Setup was a breeze, it took maybe 5 minutes, and maybe an extra 5 for the updates.  The picture is crisp and clear, it has great sound, the keyboard is very comfortable and easy to read.  I purchased the windows 11 version and have no regrets.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that it has a thumb print reader for security and easy sign in. With the exception of heavy gaming, I can't imagine there is anything that the average user wouldn't be able to do for work or for school.

Run windows update, wifi back! Hooray! Two days later, where's the wifi? What wifi? No wifi here. Doesn't look like there ever was. Back to the dongle. Run windows update, nothing. Uh oh. Update drivers, nothing. Update BIOS, nothing. Uninstall / reinstall drivers, nothing. HP diagnostic program is a joke. Won't run unless I'm connected to the internet. What? How's that supposed to help troubleshoot connection issues? Device manager has no hardware/drivers. Not even hidden ones. Hours of research on the internet. Tried a bunch of command prompt stuff people said worked for them. Nothing. Countless restarts. Long story short error 45 accross the board, no hardware detected.

"...that pesky known issue of ""no WI-FI""...","I read the reviews here before I purchased this laptop 8 days ago, including the 'no wifi' reviews; I actually thought that 'I wont get one of those', ...but I did..., and since no one had said that HP has a fix, I was ready to return my laptop to Amazon for a replacement because the laptop itself is great as far as features and performance[so far]. Well, I called Amazon and they got HP Support in on a 3-way call. HP used the HP Support Assistant app on the laptop to diagnose and temp-fix the issue, once I was on wifi,  they remotely updated all drivers associated with the wifi issue, and the laptop in general, for a permanent wifi fix, this, all via the wifi connection; and, they are waiting for my update to ensure that the issue is resolved permanently, so for now, I am impressed with the HP laptop and the HP support. I just wish I didnt have a need for the support in the first place. Also, after watching what the tech did remotely, a knowledgeable  person who is AWARE of the HP Support Assistant app could troubleshoot and fix the wifi issue themselves as long as they then also go to the HP site and update the laptop wifi and any other recommended out of date drivers; But again, we shouldnt have to do that... last note, I also have a 3 year old HP Envy laptop that I can now hand off to a family member, it has been bulletproof since day one.

Nice Small Laptop For Web Surfing and Email.,"The HP Laptop 15-dy5024nr is capable of web surfing and checking email and maybe a little Microsoft word.  It is full of the usual HP bloat ware most of which can be uninstalled. This is not a gaming laptop.  I installed the online game Runescape and it was able run ok but No Man’s Sky ran for a few seconds and shut down, probably due to a memory problem. With only 8 GB of ram and a 256 GB SSD, it is very limited.  It is small, light and mostly plastic.  There are no user serviceable panels to remove to upgrade ram etc. There is no user manual that I am aware of that explains how to do anything to this laptop.  I believe you can remove the entire back to gain access to the ram and SSD.  I may do this at a later date and will post pictures if I do.  According to online memory sellers, the ram is upgradable to a max of 64 GB with 2 DDR4 PC4-25600 3200MHz SODIMM NON-ECC Unbuffered 260pin 1.2V CL22 sticks for a cost of around $200. To upgrade to 32 GB it will cost over $80. The SSD can be upgraded to 500 GB ($55) or 1 TB ($95).  This laptop does not have a CD/DVD, Display Port or a USB port for charging the laptop. It does have a full size HDMI Port, a USB C 3.0 data port and 2 USB A 3.0 data ports. It also has a head phone/microphone port and a full size SD card reader and of course a port for the charging cable. All ports tested and worked as expected. The keyboard is chicklet style but works well and the touch pad works well also.  The speakers are loud enough. I connected a wireless mouse with no problem. I used the USB C port to connect to my Galaxy S20+ 5G cell phone and all worked as expected. It has a camera for Skype or other video call software.  The screen is bright and looks good to me.  The Wi-Fi works great.

Internal wifi adapter dies within 5 days of use,Purchased as a Christmas gift on Nov 29th. Box was never opened until Christmas morning. Wife was thrilled. Set up laptop to home WiFi and all seemed well until the morning of the 30th when wife went to log on and had no internet connection. I tried to connect and soon realized the internet adapter in the laptop was dead. I went through all the trouble shooting steps and the only thing it said was an ethernet cable was disconnected or broken. The laptop has no ethernet ports. Device manager only had Bluetooth and ExpressVPN TUN adapter listed. The internal WiFi card is supposed to be a MediaTek Wi-Fi 6 MT7921 (2x2) and Bluetooth® 5.2 combo (Supporting Gigabit data rate) internal chipset. I reset the laptop retaining the personal user information and files and it still wouldn't connect. I then just reset the laptop to factory default wiping all data so it booted up as it did Christmas morning. After setting up location and keyboard it went to the screen in the photo above to connect to a network. As you can see the next button is grayed out and you cannot proceed beyond this point.,G.

It’s just okay,"I have a iMac desktop which I absolutely love but I can’t take it with me when I leave the house, so I bought this little guy so I could grab and go. I was anticipating a little more from it to be honest. There are a few big problems I have with it. First, it runs Windows 11 S. I don’t know what the S stands for but I’m guessing it means slow because it is painfully slow. Downloading the software updates took over a hour and a half. Secondly, the 64GB hard drive space is half way full just from the operating system and software applications it comes with.  I used 2GB loading photos alone. I decided not to put my music on it just to save disk space. Lastly, as I said  before, it runs Windows 11 S. I attempted to download some files from the internet but the Windows wouldn’t allow me to do it. It forces you to use Microsoft Store which is terrible if your looking for a good selection of apps. If you’re okay with those problems I experienced then go ahead and buy yourself one. I would suggest you spend your money elsewhere.

Not to mention even after 10 years the hardware will most likely still be good. It's the evolution of software plus a stupid amount of updates that the hardware in 10 years MIGHT NOT handle be able to handle. I say that lightly. Even if they can't most can be decently upgraded if you get a laptop, even better if you can get a desktop for most people's needs. Don't know why hp makes these.

Outstanding Profile And Performance Versus Thermals Control,"This laptop is elevated by its rubber feet 2 cm off the ground.

Great laptop for the money. Really is way better than I expected.,"Usually when you get a laptop for this price you expect the laptop to be a little on the slower side especially since most laptops today have 16 GB of memory. This laptop comes with 8 GB of memory soldered in and the laptop will accept another 8 GB of memory which is on order. This is surprisingly fast for only 8 gigs of memory. I had no issues with downloads, apps watching movies or downloading about 250 gb of data from my one drive. The laptop boots up in about 20 seconds. Really does not need anything else for my use. Might not be enough for gaming but should be kind of decent. My one big complaint about this laptop is the touch panel and keyboard is off center, they did this to put in a number pad which is nice feature. The problem is that on the touch pad while I am trying to click on the item, I keep on right clicking on the item. Also, when I put my hands on the keyboard, I sometimes am off by one position and have to reset my hand.  I am sure I will overcome the keyboard but the touchpad I am having a hard time with. So, besides the 8GB of memory ordered I ordered a 1 TB SSD drive. I hate one drive I am old schooled I love having items on my computer and being fast. One drive is very clunky but is very usefull for not loosing data when the hard drive goes or for this instance when I got a new computer. It was painless to transfer everything over. For wifi connectivity the router is upstairs and I am in the room directly below and getting speeds of 400 MBPS which is really fast. Sitting next to the router I have hit average speed of 639 download and peak of just over 700 using Speedtest. My MacBook is not even doing that. The laptop is really light and feels just a touch flimsy there is almost no flex in the base part and screen does not flex opening and closing. If you grab both ends of the top of the screen you can get it to flex. Not a deal breaker at this price point and I really love the laptop. I have had a Dell and also an HP laptop at this price point in the past and was alway disappointed and by upgrading was happy. This one many years later which should be costing several hundred dollars more due to inflation but got at the same price as both of them ($500) is quite the bargain. I did not get to test other laptops at this price point but I know this is quite a deal. You will not be disappointed and even though I ordered more memory and a bigger SSD the laptop is pretty good just the way it is. I will upgrade to see if I see any more improvements in speed with the RAM. It never hurts to have more. Bonus this has Windows 11 Pro.",mrajfura,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2022",28 people found this helpful

She is using one port for a Logitech unifying receiver, that leaves only one port for her USB drive. She would have to buy a Multi port hub. She loves the sleek appearance. The grey silver color is pleasing to the eye. The keys are visible. The base got heated up hence she has put it up on plastic lids so that it is elevated. That helped. The webcam can be hidden by just moving a slider, what a relief! All in all, a good buy.

Be wary of the warranty- You need to request a ticket to get your full year.,"I'm really not happy with the purchase of this machine.  The first one arrived, we charged it, and the screen would not work.  We confirmed the battery was green and working, and that the blinking light on the power button meant it was in sleep mode.  We tried all of the tips on Lenovo's help forum to no avail.  Upon scanning the QR code, we discovered we were already three months into the warranty.  So we returned it for an exchange.  When the new one came today we scanned the code again.  This one as well was a couple of months into warranty.  So, we hunted around on their website and found an article that they base the warranty start date on when a supplier purchases the machine and add a single month.  I have tried several times to update the warranty via their ticket process yet, every time I go to actually submit the ticket, it's freezing and not going through.  This one so far at least seems to work.  However, they should include information on the warranty with the device.  At the very least they should make it clear on their site without having to hunt it down that they have a process to update it (assuming it works as I've been unsuccessful thus far).",Jay,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2022",11 people found this helpful

I had control of the cursor with the mouse and touchpad, but the keyboard was useless. Also: Twice the cursor has ""taken over,"" and started ripping out a single letter, as if someone is holding the key down. The only way to stop it and regain control is to shut it off and reboot. Per tech support advice I did a factory reset, but the problems continued, both those described above. I'm done. Sending it back. Won't be getting another Lenovo if at all possible.

"Case cracked from normal wear and tear, not covered under Lenovo warranty","I bought my Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook in April, 2021 so I have an older model than this new one.  It works fine, charges fast, I don't have any complaints about the electronics. A few weeks ago I noticed my Chromebook wasn't closing properly and it turns out the case cracked right next to the right hinge from opening and closing it with normal usage. The hinges allows me to fold the screen behind the keyboard to use it like a tablet, I never did it, but if I tried it now the case would crack apart more from the pressure and be unusable.",JoAnne,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on July 7, 2022",One person found this helpful
Rattling Keyboard,"I purchased one of these in August.  I really liked the feature set, in particular the 8 Gb Ram, and a backlit keyboard. That one had problems with the keyboard.  The Tab, Search, Shift, CTRL 1, q, a, z keys all rattled. That one also had issues with the display. The display has areas in the upper left and upper right side which were displaying as lighter color.  It was most noticeable on a dark background.

It's pretty impressive except....,I'm transitioning from a very old Lenovo laptop and trying Chromebook for the first time.  There is a learning curve coming from Windows and Mac (I don't care what anyone says).  The Chromebook itself is very impressive.  It is light and easy to use.  The touch screen is my only concern.  Sometimes it works great and other times I have to touch a button multiple times before it reacts.  Maybe it's my fingers but I also have the same issue when using a Penoval pen.  I'm not planning to return the unit just complaining about the one thing that bugs me.  Your mileage may vary.,Mudshark99,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 11, 2022",

Factory Second? Deceptive advertising? Return policy!,"First, the description is really unclear and should get you asking questions before you buy . Seller is contradictory but it is an i3 with 8 gigs at a GREAT price. However, I think these didn't pass any quality testing. The screen on mine was not properly laminated in and I have to think it will eventually get much worse so I am returning it. It wasn't damaged as the box and chassis were in perfect shape. Since they ask you to pay for the return on the product I wont be ordering another from here. I'll pay full price for something I can trust to last.  It might hold up but I'm not taking any chances as I plan to travel with this and it might get jostled. UPDATE - Reported vendor to Amazon, $27 out of pocket to return defective product.

Performance noticeably worse than Flex 5i with 128GB SSD,"I purchased this Flex 5i with 64GB eMMC (~$300) and the one with 128GB Samsung SSD (~$400) to compare. Using chrome:\\system I confirmed they are running the same CPU, the same amount of memory (8GB), and the same platform (Volteer) . Although there doesn't seem to be much hardware difference, their performance is noticeably different. The 64GB unit's Linux virtual machine is completely tying up the CPU, while it is using a very small percent of CPU resources/time on the 128GB unit. On the 64GB unit, 10 tabs in Chrome is all it takes to see significant lag when switching between tabs, and sometimes the mouse lags and jumps around the screen. I only saw this behavior on the 128GB unit after opening something like 40 tabs, and even then it wasn't as bad. The other extremely noticeable difference is that the 64GB unit can only drive an external 1920 x 1080 display at 30Hz interlaced, resulting in obvious motion blur while scrolling on websites, while the 128GB unit can drive the same display at full 60Hz with no observable motion blur. Although the 128GB unit is  ~33% ($100) more than the 64GB unit, I find the latter unusable, and therefore the former is well worth the additional cost.",JC,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on August 9, 2022",4 people found this helpful

"Very speedy and portable Chromebook, with SanDisk memory port -- but shop around on price","I like having a convenient Chromebook for searching, streaming videos, answering emails, and performing everyday tasks, which gives my bigger laptop (with Windows, Word, and other programs) a rest.  I had a trusty Samsung Chromebook but it just reached its support expiration date.  I was amazed to pay less for this Lenovo IdeaPad 3 11 than I did for that old Samsung, especially since it's also clearly better: more light-weight, more portable (but same screen size), and very noticeably faster, with a superior keyboard and touchpad.  I was thinking of getting another Samsung, but the one in a comparable price range did not have a micro SanDisk slot, which my old Samsung did have and which I find very useful, since I download a lot of files in the course of a month.  That was the decisive factor for me.  The only thing I regret is not looking around for an even *better* price, which I discovered I could have had from BestBuy.  But I still think the price is incredible, especially with hyper-inflation.  Strongly recommended, so long as you don't mind an 11.6"" screen.

The processor speed is impressive and the graphics quality are great too. Battery life is more than sufficient and I often don't even need to take my charger with me when I'm out all day. I love the flexibility of the hinge and its sleek design.

Difficult to get warrantee repair updates once shipped/received,"The Chromebook died within a month, and it was very difficult to contact Lenovo. Amazon Custer Service helped, and I was given shipping labels to ship in for warrantee repairs. Weeks without updates, multiple dropped calls, multiple different call in numbers, you name it...only to find out it was received but it is still in receiving waiting for a work order. It is awful!

Does not have Windows,Purchased for the purpose of organizing household finances in one place. The computer was decent. It did not have touch screen---somehow the product description made me think it did. Start-up was quick. My issue is because it did not have the Windows operating system it was not compatible with some software I needed to install. Did not come with Microsoft office either. I would need to use the subscription I had via a browser instead of opening on the desktop which I also was not a fan of. I did like that it was compact and small enough to fit in a large purse and charging time was decent. Comparable to a more expensive Chromebook I purchased for my daughter for school just less memory.

"Best Bang For Your Buck, Period","My job is entirely Google based.  I bought this as a second work computer because my company laptop is a Thinkpad and it's heavy.  I just wanted to leave that at home and have a nice sleek backup for any work tasks I'd need to do in a pinch out of the house.  I couldn't be more pleased with this.  It's light, fast, and the battery life is fantastic.  Lenovos are known for having great keyboards and this is the best one I've used on a small laptop.  It also doesn't look or feel cheap.  The only thing that shows 'budget' is the screen, as it won't blow you away.  But it's still very solid and surprisingly good from the side, where most screens in this price range are garbage viewed from an angle.  If you are in the market for a laptop, and you are in the probably 95% of the public that absolutely doesn't really need an $800 laptop for what they use it for, rush out and buy this one while the price is still insane.",AROB1979,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on September 4, 2022",47 people found this helpful

Worth the Money and Then Some,"This is the best Lenovo I have owned to date. It is also my first Chromebook and although I was underwhelmed in the specs I was thoroughly mistaken as this is more than meets the eye (for me at least). This thing started up faster than any OS I have had and this includes complete updates and transfer over of other apps and device info. I`m not sure if this is also driven with the same camera software as Pixel phones. Things seem smoother and sharper considering the stats of this machine. A conversation over Facebook Messenger was better than on all my higher end machines on Windows, Linux etc. The OS itself takes less than I expected as well but I added an extra 128 gb into the microSD slot that securely and snugly clicks out of harm's way, unlike my last notebook. Although at eleven inches it seems a little thicker than what we would expect, it is lighter than my last (HP Stream 11). It charges fairly quickly and the battery lasts a while but really shines in closing the lid. It looks like it uses almost no power in hibernation/sleep mode and wakes up in a snap. I have always had Windows issues with this and evn Linux seemed to eat up the battery at a quick and steady rate in any dormant modes. Windows would not wake up correctly many times either and we would have to do a hard reboot or even a battery pull to fix the problem (If that is even possible). Streaming games worked pretty well too. The system won't be able to play the better games on the components it has on Steam but you can stream it smoothly and also Stadia is integrated in the system for a better gaming experience than what you would expect for lesser hardware.",J.

Great price excellent for school,"My oldest, 13yo, does a lot of her schoolwork online. She has her own chrome book, but we wanted one dedicated to just school. So, I bought this one. It is not touch screen, which is fine. It works great. She can do her reports and schoolwork on it. There isn’t anything really fancy about it. I really like it and when she goes to her classes, it’s easy for her to take with her. She’s in gifted and will be taking concurrent college classes when she starts high school next year, at that point, we will get her a different one that is touch screen and has more features. My youngest will then use this one. I would definitely recommend it to others and really love the Lenovo brand. It shipped quick.

Worst computer buy ever,"This is the absolute worst computer buy I've ever made! The screen has a matte finish on it, making it very difficult to see in any kind of light. The screen is also not bright- the colors are so muted (especially all the grey tone writing) that it's extremely hard to read. The screen is way too small for me. It's NOT a touch screen, which is a miserable step back in tech. There is no scroll strip adjacent to the finger pad and scrolling with the finger pad and arrow is difficult. Every the you want to scroll, you have to depress the finger pad (which is too hard to hold down, killing your finger joint within just 10 minutes), find the scroll bar on the right of the screen with the cursor, and 90% of the time the cursor won't stay on the scroll bar, as the page edge is right next to it. Instead of scrolling, you end up shrinking the page size instead. The finger pad requires too much pressure to keep down while trying to scroll and the ratio of movement, from finger movement to cursor movement, is too low. IE- you have to make at least 4 full finger pad width swipes to cross the screen one time with the cursor. Terrible setup!! Save your money and get a real laptop or you'll be wildly frustrated, as I am. If I could return it and be sure my info was wiped off it, I'd send it back in a heartbeat.

Died exactly 1 year after purchase,"Inexpensive little computer I needed as a Registration workstation for events.  We use it once a month.  At exactly 1 year, it stopped working.  The screen went black and the keyboard felt very hot.  I unplugged it, let it is sit for a few weeks until I could get the time to call Lenovo.  I tried to turn it on, just to see, and it did start up.  But Lenovo says it will probably happen again, and if I give them $39 they will extend the warranty for another year (or $60 for 2) and then send me a box to return the computer to be repaired.  I don't think I want to waste any money on it.  It's a cheap little computer, I think it should have lasted more than a year, though.

The screen can be seen in about any lighting condition, direct sunlight is a little sketchy but still usable. The battery life (for me) is about 2 weeks, really depends on what I'm doing though. If I'm really using it for work and then come home to mess around on the internet I'll get about 10 hours sometimes 11 hours but that's really pushing it. The screen size is pretty nice it's only 11 inches but for what I really do on it I don't mind, if I need to do more I usually get on my 17 inch but for timesheets and excel this little thing is nice. Performance side of things this thing runs great, 99% of apps open in seconds. For the money this is a fantastic machine, perfect size for on the go, responds instantly, and lives all day or more in my case.

After weighing the pros-and-cons I went for the Windows Surface Pro 8 because there are no decent Linux tablets available and having tested my wife's iPad I was not interested in one of those.  I also purchased the flip down keyboard/cover which is a must for my use cases.  Long story short I was very pleasantly surprised by the display, performance, battery life, and form-factor with the fold down keyboard.

The requirements of the sulfur however really taxed that version of the surface pro three and so this upgrade to surface pro eight has been like coming out of the dark ages into the light. The system is incredibly responsive, and I’m absolutely loving the speed at which it processes the application and any of the tasks that I’ve thrown at it. My only issue is that for some reason Microsoft has chosen to replace the SD slot with the capability to replace  the internal drive and I really miss that little drive.

Major problems after one month,"I have had a few Surface tablets over the years including the very first model, all worked fine. Since then, I have had laptops from many different companies with varying quality etc. It was time for a new laptop so I thought I would try Surface again, big mistake. I bought the Surface Pro 8 with i7-1185G7 @ 3.00GHz  3.00 GHz; 16 gigs RAM and a 256gig SSD. It seemed to be acting a bit ""strange"" from the beginning, but I thought it was me adjusting to this tablet. Well, it all went downhill from there. I contacted Microsoft support a few times, they had me re-install Windows a few times but every time a new issue would come up. After several support sessions they said that the hardware was defective, and I needed to have a replacement. I thought that was ok until they said it would be a used ""reconditioned"" unit that would function perfectly. Having had ""reconditioned"" units in the past I knew that I was just acquiring someone elses issues. Plus, I had only had the unit for just over two months! So, I said that I would rather upgrade to a different model and pay the difference. Because this had gone on so long the 60-day period for return/exchange had passed. I was told by one agent that Microsoft had a trade-in program, so I checked it out. The amount that Microsoft wanted to give me for two-and-a-half-month-old Surface was $180!!! I paid over $2000 for it. My issue and request was sent to a ""team"" and they said because my Surface was bought 90 days ago, I would only receive a used unit and no return and upgrade. Needless to say, I said no and will relegate it to the few things that it can still do. I would never buy a Micrsoft product again. Over the years I have been a loyal customer and apologist of theirs. I've had many Surface units, countless Microsoft laptops from many different manufacturers, three Surface phones (remember them?) etc. They have made clear that they have no interest in customer service, all they want is our money and get lost.",Lorne Tyczenski,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on September 18, 2022",One person found this helpful

"The New Chromebook, now with crippled Chrome web browser","I had an early model Chromebook ten years ago and liked the convenience of browsing the internet with it, which is about 75% of the time I use a home computer for anyway. It eventually reached the rather arbitrary ""end of life"" when Google stopped security software updates for it. There was no trade-in offered for it, so into the dumpster it went. I bought this more recent Samsung device, which has the added functionality of supporting Android apps, whoopee duh. But I was very disappointed to find that scrolling with a mouse using the Chrome web browser was crippled. The mouse wheel crawls, with no way to adjust it, and the problem doesn't exist in any other apps or the Chrome OS. If you try to use the scrollbar, it minimizes to nothing, and you have to fish around blindly for the few pixels that will grab it. From what I've read in forums, this problem has existed for years. Apparently Google thinks that since users can still scroll with the touchpad I should just get over it. Or another workaround is to download any other company's web browser from their app store; the scroll bar will still disappear but the mouse wheel functions normally. My solution was to go back to using an Asus Vivobook that runs Windows 10. If Google fixes the scrolling problem I might eventually return to using this Chromebook, otherwise I'll be tossing it out.",Knukleur,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 23, 2022",4 people found this helpful

Fire hazard.,"This computer caught fire when placed on an armchair for a few minutes.  It was plugged in and vent holes were not obstructed.  The return process was cumbersome.  One particular ""Bruh"" treated me poorly without reason.  He was a manager and was acting like I was planning to sue which was not in the plan but how was he to know.  I was not acting with hostility.  Told him that I had pictures if he needed any documentation.  10 days later.  Once the return was ok'd the Samsung plus representative was very careful to point out that the return was only for the damaged device.  Guess these guys have been sued a number of times as they seemed paranoid.  Once I got the the Samsung plus phone system in order to establish a preference on how I would be payed back I was transferred at least 10X over two days and two calls.  I had two problems, one was that I did not have an account number.  They gave it to me on the second day.  The other was that I was locked out of my account and spent 45 minutes waiting and transferring without success.  Finally my account timed up and reopened so I was able to use the act number they gave me...btw was the wrong number.  She said it one way and repeated another and I repeated the one number that was different and she confirmed.  When I went live on the website I used both numbers because the first was wrong.

Handy Dandy,"This is a nice compact Chromebook. It was purchased as a Father's Day gift. The battery life lasts a good while, around 5 hours with a good charge.

Good processor but confuse specs to be a budget gaming computer,"The lot of thinks the HP did to make this computer price under 1000 dollars, can be a problem for the future of the brand Victus, they install 2 x 4Gb ram memory to save some pennies, some versions have 144hz display but a more ship video board, other 60hz with a better configuration, so hard to choose from the options.",Evelyn Umana,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2022",3 people found this helpful
Buena pero esperaba mas,"Un diseño bueno, me gusto mucho, pero hay varias cosas que no me agradaron, primero que vienen con 2 RAMS de 4GB aunque si lo ponen en chiquito, la pantalla no es la mejor y por último, lo que más me decepcionó, solo 1 slot para ssd, al parecer el segundo slot se lo quitaron.",Juan,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 15, 2022",2 people found this helpful
Great entry level,"The only drawback is the battery. A little over an hour of high graphics gaming and its dead. Otherwise, this can handle quite a bit. I'm happy with it.",Miles,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2022",4 people found this helpful

"Moderate laptop with okay battery life, and some caveats","I wouldn’t say this laptop is worth a full price of $1000, but for a discount it might be good for you. I got this laptop for going off to college (engineering, hence the GPU) and its performance is pretty great for the price. (Got it for $750) It also doesn’t have a bunch of crazy accents and colors which I really appreciate on a laptop. Comes installed with a bit of “bloatware” like the HP Omen center which I did find to be pretty useful. One thing to note is that the display on this is 60Hz. If you’re looking for a 120-144Hz display you’ll be disappointed with this one. It also doesn’t have the best colors and vibrance on the screen which isn’t really an issue but might bother some. Battery life is passable (hard to give an exact number, but I was able to watch YouTube video at 480p for 4h30m with rather low brightness and power saver enabled. Can probably extrapolate from there. Something better would be ideal but you should look for a Ryzen model if you want actual good battery life. One thing advertises is that the laptop can charge from 0% to 50% in 30 minutes, and this is indeed true which impressed me. Overall despite my nagging, it’s a good-looking laptop with good specs for a sale price and passable battery life.",Joanne M.
