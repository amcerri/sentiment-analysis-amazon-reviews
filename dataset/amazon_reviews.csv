0,PlayStation 5 Console,Worth the wait!,"After looking for almost a year, and waiting months for an invite to purchase, I was able to order the PS5 disc edition and I cannot be more pleased.  I picked up Sackboy: A Big Adventure and Ratchet & Clank Rift Apart to start my library, and both are more than impressive.  The system is easy to set up, and the resolution is incredible, even on a non-4K television.  I am using a 1080p LG oled and the picture and frame rate is magnificent.  When I upgrade TV's later on, I can only imagine the difference.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"October 23, 2022",W. R.

1,PlayStation 5 Console,Finally! Amazon makes getting a PS5 possible!,"I've wanted a PS5 for a while now. Ironically, it has less to do with any PS5-exclusive games (you can count those on one hand, pretty much), but after getting a 4K TV, I wanted to see just how big of a difference there was in my existing PS4 library...plus, I wanted a PS5 anyway. Given the problematic microchip shortage (still aching to get a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, thanks scalpers), I wasn't confident in getting one of these anytime soon, not to mention the rampant scalping that is still ongoing. When I heard about Amazon's invitation approach, I thought ""what the heck?"" and gave it a shot. I got my invite days later, and pulled the trigger.I got a month of the Premium Plus membership, which I also heartily recommend, especially for those who are just starting too dip their toes into video games. It's a real good deal. Played through all of Dark Pictures: Little Hope and Ys IX, and a few game trials and more. It's at its best on the PS5, BTW. The system is excellent, but I should mention that at this time, it's essentially a ""Super PS4 Pro"". I know that this is consistent with new systems, and it appears that current global events are putting the stranglehold on more innovation, but I am glad to see some really awesome PS5 games coming soon, especially Alan Wake 2, Street Fighter 6, and more.I've just gotta say it. The system looks weird, and weirder still on its side. It comes with a base that does the job, but like my wife described it, it looks ""melted"". My own opinion, I think it's too much design, but don't judge a book by its cover. The system and interface is exceptional, and gameplay is wonderful. The controller has even more heft to it than the PS4 DualShock, probably thanks to all the little motors in it delivering haptic feedback. This takes a lot of getting used to, but it's so novel that I'm more intrigued by it than anything else.I'm really glad to get one of these, even if it was at full MSRP. (I usually wait for Black Friday deals, but given the current climate for microprocessors and the demand of these, I wasn't counting on this for at least a couple of years.) For anyone who has struggled to get one, really just request an invite. No obligation, but mine literally shipped and arrived the day I ordered it. No other business is even coming close to as (frankly) elegant way of fighting the scalpers on this front than Amazon. Now if they would just do the same for those Raspberry Pis, I'd be thrilled!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"July 12, 2022",Daniel Hemsath,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHMVFM5M3T6DENSTHTAS3GGXDWYQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True
2,PlayStation 5 Console,Finally!!!,"After two years of searching and months being on the Amazon waitlist…I got the email to purchase a PS5! Love the console. It’s bigger than I thought it would be, but it’s super quite and fast. I loved that all the games I had in the cloud could be retrieved on here and all of my saves moved over. That took about 2 hours, but it was well worth it. I’ve been using for a few mo that now and the white controller is still as bright as it was out of the box. I was nervous with it being white, it would show dirty hand/sweat/dirt markings, but so far that has not been the case. So happy I was able to finally get a system and enjoy the new games coming out with the graphics and speed that the game designers envisioned when they made it!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"October 7, 2022",Sara,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG7VJ6MRXABA7SHIYBMSPEAQBZEQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

5,PlayStation 5 Console,Love it,"So far am loving it...have had every system except the 4 and never really been disappointed in any of them so far. The only thing have ever had a complaint about is the fact you have to start over buying games everytime other than with the ps2. I think they should make every system, playstation xbox and nintendo where they can play all old system games ESPECIALLY as expensive as games are these days.  It is ridiculous to spend the money on all these games to have to turn around and repurchase the same or newer version when the next system comes out.  That is part of reason never bothered with the ps4, I was tired and could not afford to keep starting over and most times the games I loved like the Breath of Fire series never made it to the newer ones.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"September 20, 2022",mkjohnson4471,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHCPVDKW2BE57IYPSVY6XRVPROFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

I have the new PS Plus and have a large library of games to play through that. I heard people say how awesome the controller is, but I wasn't convinced until I tried it for myself.

12,PlayStation 5 Console,Very happy with the graphics and the controller,"I didn't want to pay some eBay scalper a premium for a PS5, so few months ago I signed up for an ""invitation"" to buy one from Amazon at retail. I figured I had a slim chance of actually getting a PS5, but I could wait. Fast forward a few months and I was happy to see an invitation from Amazon!I am very glad that I got it. The graphics are the best I've seen and the controller is great! It even has a touch pad and tilt control.The only games I care about are racing simulators. I bought Gran Turismo 7, WRC 10, and Need For Speed Remastered. The PS5 does great with those games except for the latter (which is a PS4 game). It works with the PS5 controller, but not with a steering wheel and pedals. (This is the game developer's issue, not Sony's). But hopefully in a few months they will issue a new version of Need for Speed for the PS5.Anyway, get one of these if you can!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"September 6, 2022",Brett C.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGI5GSPVR53KKPB4BGU7SP4IDVFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

PS has fixed a lot of bugs and I can't stress how important updating the console is before you play - just update it first and save yourself the frustration.The console iself is quick, graphics amazing - everything you would expect but the thing I took notice of the most is the haptic feedback and adaptive triggers of the new pad... you'll just have to expeience it yourself.

50,PlayStation 5 Console,Amazing,"Amazon to the rescue after a year and a half of waiting to find a system. The ps5 is truly something special. You would be hard pressed to build a pc of this quality for $500. Yet thats what Sony has done for you here. It loads games within seconds, not minutes like older systems.

71,PlayStation 5 Console,The PlayStation to End All PlayStations (for now),"Fast, powerful, and beautiful. A few quick thoughts as you skim reviews:1. Controller is amazing. As someone who played Xbox exclusively for over ten years, I was skeptical - but I love it. The precision of the force feedback, the speaker/microphone combination, and the adaptive triggers are great fun and contribute to the immersive factor.2. Don’t sleep on the pre-installed Astro’s Playground. It’s been since the pre-N64 years that a console actually came WITH a game. It’s included. It’s fun. Play it.3. It’s laughably huge. As you’ll see if the photo, there was barely enough room in my cabinet for it. I had to alter the cabinet to allow for airflow. Measure and prepare.4. Get an certified HDMI 2.1 cable. Don’t trust the one it ships with, as I’ve read multiple reports that’s it’s not a true 2.1 cable.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"June 13, 2022",Scott D,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AETJSXYNWHYHA6FEKAJCZFAVYZKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

79,PlayStation 5 Console,Insane loading time and 10 times quieter than PS4,"This is my best purchase of the year!I've been playing PS for so many years because of its exclusive games. I really enjoy it but the loading time was a bit long recently since the modern game's quality is good. I don't know what type of SSD this PS5 is using but the loading time is insane - most of the time it finishes while you read the text on the screen.With the fast loading time, the console can load the data more than you think - which can give you a way better gaming experience, the graphics are better and the lights and shadows in-game are more realistic.Another thing I have to mention is the noise of the console. If you had a PS4 you know every time you turn it on or start to play, it's just like you playing at the airport - super noisy. PS5 is 10 times quieter! That's a big thing because the noise is really a distraction when you try to play FPS games listening to the footsteps. A huge plus for FPS gamers.There are so many good things to say if you're a gamer. I can only say it's good if you are always a PS guy. I don't own a next-gen XBOX so I'm not sure how that performs, but as a PS player, you will be happy about these. The long time wait was worth it.Talk about the games, PS5 supports previous PS4 games and many of them can be upgraded to the PS5 version for free, the quality and experience were enhanced so enjoy!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"January 20, 2022",peter721,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEVKKOSIMZYOMOONKZUF44J5QGEQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

122,PlayStation 5 Console,Worth the year long wait,"I still can't believe I was able to get one of these. I was almost beginning to think the PS5 was fake news. It might be a giant monster sitting on the shelf, but the power this thing has is incredible. My controller sucks ass though, it started out as a work of art. But it eats battery power like nothing I've seen before and other people tell me that too. IT went from charging to 2 bars to not charging at all in about 2 weeks.Edit: Hard to say if my controller is damaging my USB C cables or if the console is doing it. My charging issue was fixed with a new cable...but I've had to replace my cable 3 times. The original USB that came with the controller lasted 2 weeks so I used a spare one and it went bad soon after. This last time I bought a comparatively expensive cable to see if this makes a difference in how long it lasts. My PS4's micro USB cable was $4 and lasted 6 years...what gives?",5.0 out of 5 stars,"January 4, 2022",stephen west,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEAIUHQD2JG6Z5OX3QA3RMRHFYAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True
123,PlayStation 5 Console,Great console,"I’ve only had PlayStation consoles since the PS3 slim.  I really liked the PS4 Pro and the PS5 solves the prior gen shortcomings.  Blazing fast SSD performance makes it seem like the old cartridge consoles of yesteryear for loading times.  My biggest complaints are the color, shape, size, and storage capacity.  This thing is BIG.  The color doesn’t match any other device in my TV stand so it stands out.  Thankfully you can now purchase different color plates but it’s crappy you have to pay more to make it match.  The curvy design requiring a stand is awkward at best.  Finally the storage capacity is 825 GB rather than a more industry standard 1 TB.  With the OS you’re only left with 667 GB usable which is used up quickly.  You can run PS4 games from an external drive to save space.

125,PlayStation 5 Console,A fantastic console and system - worth every penny,"Amazon Purchase and delivery review: I obtained this console through Amazon thanks to @supplyninja on Twitter with the drop, retail price, via Treasure Truck. I suggest everyone follow him. I waited over two months to obtain the console, and it came on time via Amazon. I was very skeptical that Amazon allowed the external box to be delivered in a partially opened condition. With a very close examination of the PS5 box and console, serial numbers matched and the console was not bricked at all.Console review: Having said all of that, this is an AMAZING console. PS Plus has good game deals, PS Now expands the library available to you. The controller is great in hand and I am comfortable playing a game for 6+ hours before the next charge or a break. System storage is large, but these games can fill that up quickly. If you want more storage, get an M.2 and install it internally, as external additional storage can only store PS4 games. With Playstation's exclusives in mind, Sony is showing the gaming industry how to do gaming and entertainment!(If only it was more available).",5.0 out of 5 stars,"December 10, 2021",Fernando C.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEZYMG4NDCZU343VPTPOFYLSSNZQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

Rectangular would help when it comes to placement. Setup was very straightforward.I am coming from the PS4, so I was expecting the interface to be the same. There are some slight changes that make it fresh, but all in all it didn't feel confusing.When playing a game, you can definitely see a difference. On the PS4, character hair seemed stuck in clumps, while the 5 is a bit more flowy(is that a word?).

The hard thing is getting yours hands on one. I got extremely lucky and was fast enough to buy one. The shipping was fast and everything arrived as expected. The ps5 is extremely fast and forget the days of your console sounding like a jet taking off. The UI in my opinion is 10x better than the one on ps4. Everything is easy to find and it's very smooth. The games look outstanding. Amazing machine🔥,5.0 out of 5 stars,"January 23, 2022",Crisarlin C.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHRVNFPXD3M5JOJBTTSPX65LSAGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

The image and gameplay mechanics were out of this world.  Everything ran smoothly and efficiently.  The reason why it's only a 4 star is because the console is impossible to come by.  It took me the longest of time to get it.  Also, the packaging was sub-par.  It didn't have a lot of brown paper or peanuts for the console.  It  could've been easily damaged.

161,PlayStation 5 Console,Beware!,"Got our first console through the Sony invite, no problems whatsoever.  Then I got another invite from Amazon and we pounced on it so the wife could upgrade her PS4.  Right out of the box the new one would stop pairing with the controller within a minute of startup! We never even got to finish the updates, as we can't use the controller after the first couple commands work fine.  Spent way too much time on the phone with Amazon, who in the end could only offer a refund.  No replacement!  Upon going to the Sony page, they will take it for repair, but ""expect extended delay for return.""  Screw it, at this point we'll get our money back and wait again for another chance.  I sincerely hope you have better luck than we did, but at least the first one still works!  BTW,  I found online this pairing issue seems pretty common, although NO fix offered resolved the problem with ours. Good luck!",2.0 out of 5 stars,"September 21, 2022",P.

227,PlayStation 5 Console,Pretty Disappointing Overall,"Update 2: controller ergonomics are pretty bad. It's the most cluttered controller I've used and due to smaller hands I have a hard time reaching buttons near the center of the controller. Not to mention that the triggers are actually painful to use. Several areas have sharp corners that dig into the fingers after short use, compounded by the high force of the trigger haptics. Gaming shouldn't be painful.Update: after another week of use, reconfirming all the below with the added issues of unhideable menu elements spoiling games (progress cards) I just started, and a HORRIBLE controller battery life with no replaceable battery save for disassembling the controller. Unacceptable.The PS5 in one word: ClutteredHaving been a multi console household for the better part of the last 20 years this is probably one of the most disappointing showings when compared to the other options out there (PC/Xbox/Steam Deck). Very few compelling exclusives, especially given that some 'exclusives' will also be on PC, considerably less accessibility forethought in nearly every aspect of the controller and UI, visually cluttered and unintuitive navigation in the basic menus, the game overlays are very visually noisy and do not duck game audio, virtually no visual customization or organization options, lights up my whole room if I want to charge a controller with no options to disable lights. It feels like every feature they could think of was added to make the core experience harder to navigate with nobody stopping to ask, do people want this? It's just not a good looking console either.In short, I regret buying this console. And until it gets some serious usability updates (unlikely given it's already a two year old console) I can't recommend it.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"August 14, 2022",Cole Morgan,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFRIDZF4KHMNKPSRRPJ7TQPRWYDQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

358,PlayStation 5 Console,DO NOT BUY A PS5 FROM AMAZON,"A little while ago I purchased a ps5 on Amazon when they were in stock and I was really excited since it’s been in short supply for a while now. When it arrived I noticed that the box had been dented but I didn’t think anything of it at first. After about 1 day of use the disc drive had stopped working altogether, disks wouldn’t eject so I found out that you can manually eject them if you open up the back of the console, however the problem was actually that the laser wasn’t working. I tried to contact support for this without any luck, knowing that the chances of getting a replacement was slim to none. Luckily I was able to purchase a new one through Sony this past week and my unboxing experience was significantly different. When I received the new device the box had a reflective sticker on it that they use to tamper-proof their boxes. So in short if you buy a PS5, even if it’s directly SOLD and SHIPPED from Amazon and you do not see this sticker save yourself the trouble and return it immediately and get your money back.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"July 3, 2022",Amazon Customer,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEV66QHXPTXSABTKQK3RRQJXW3JQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

I can use that money to pay off the PS5.It's just a better system all around! Colors, power and features are great! The reason I purchased it was because I'm looking forward to PSVR 2! I don't really care for standard gaming like I use to. I have VR for my PC and it's just another level of gaming. With the SONY it will be better because the gaming community will be more active than it is on the PC.I highly recommend it if you can get your hands on it.

507,PlayStation 5 Console,One of Sony's best consoles to date...,"I want to start this by saying I got my PS5 on launch through Sony directly. I was lucky enough to get one on pre-order. So everything I'm saying is from MY experience with the console and based on facts and not either lying about something or being salty because ""I didn't get one"" so I make up things I've heard.First STOP blaming Sony for the shortage, same with blaming Microsoft for their shortage. It's due to component shortage which all stems from the pandemic (Covid-19). You want more consoles then do the following: 1) Get vaccinated. 2) Wear a mask. 3) STOP going to large gatherings.....Secondly, if you want scalpers to stop ""stealing"" consoles or really anything then stop buying stuff from them. If there is no one buying from them then there is no profit for them to scalp highly sought after items. It's as simple as that, yet people still throw $1,000's of dollars at these things because they have to have it now..which keeps these people in business and they'll do it until it's no longer viable.Third, yes I agree Sony dropped the ball hardcore on storage in a few ways. First 860gbish w/ 600gbish of actual usable space was not the best idea there. I can't say if that was a design choice or due to larger drive shortages and/or cost. Secondly they dropped the ball on making the storage soldered to the motherboard preventing anyone from replacing it if it goes bad. As far as I know currently the M.2 slot is not usable as primary storage if the board one fails. Now as for some people saying you can only store 5 games on their drive are in my opinion lying about that. On my console I had the following installed just fine:Spiderman MMAssassins Creed ValhallaCall of Duty Cold War (Campaign, Multiplayer & zombies)Watchdogs LegionBugsnaxAstros PlayroomDemon SoulsAlong with that the people saying it costs $500 for additional storage again are either misinformed or lying for whatever reasons. For a 1tb M2 drive that works on the PS5 the MOST out of pocket you'd pay is between $250 & $300. Unless you opt for the version without a heatsink and buy a 3rd party heatsink and save some money. Is that overpriced? Yes it is by A LOT. But again THERE IS A SHORTAGE currently, not to mention importing has been a nightmare. Expect paying more right now, it's the state of things all over the world.Third, is this a true next-gen console? Honestly that is a matter of perspective, is the PS5 or Xbox series X currently being used to their max? No not even close, part of the reason is the previous gen consoles are still alive and kicking so Sony & Microsoft are still supporting those consoles. Will we see the power the PS5 can actually do any time soon? Again probably not, at least not for another couple of years. Part of the reason and actually the main one is console shortage. Until there is a steady stream of next-gen consoles available developers will continue to support both last gen and current gen consoles because that is how they sell their games and make money. I like a lot of gamers don't like that but it is how things are and I understand that like most normal people do.Lastly, the argument a lot of people have....Which is better PS5/Xbox/PC/Switch? In reality none are better than the other. Play whichever you like, I opted to hold off on the Xbox Series X simply because there weren't enough exclusive titles to make the purchase reasonable for me. But to be blunt, basing it all on power/storage/graphics is futile. I still power up my NES and play that from time to time. The whole point of a game console is to play games and have fun, don't get hung up on specs. Focus on what games you want to play and go that route. Enjoy yourself, play online and make new friends (just don't be toxic....there is no need for that). Video games are meant to be fun, arguing on which is better just ruins it for everyone.So to recap. Console shortage is due to pandemic and part shortage, impatient people keep scalpers in business, storage will always be an issue regardless of times or console, and play whatever makes you happy and don't let people shame you for what you love.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"December 16, 2021",Robert,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF4FNLD6E4564FQ3RV3HDJLVR5HA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,False

510,PlayStation 5 Console,Great,"The playstation 5 or also known as the PS5 is an upgraded version of the playstation 4. With this new console instead of playing games at 30fps now with the PS5 you can play games up to 120fps only if your tv supports it. It has a usb c charger to charge your dualshock controller for the PS5. With this charger it allows you to charge your controller at a way faster rate. Another thing is that it has triffect effects that react with the game to make it feel more realistic.My experience with this product is amazing. With this product it runs insanely fast just like a pc. It runs way faster than any console I have ever used. I also tend to play spiderman which is a game that can only be played on the ps4 or ps5 which is really fun. With the ps5 it makes you feel like you're actually inside of the game.  I love the feeling around playing spiderman and the feel of the controller just feels amazing. I have had this product for almost 2 years now and I have ot had a single problem with this product yet! I very much recommend this product.The  Pros of the product is that if you have playstation 4 disk games and you plan on throwing them away because you think you can’t play them anymore well, with the console you are able to put in the Ps4 disk inside of the ps5 and use them. One thing about this product is that it has different modes you can turn it into. You can put it in rest mode and then the Ps5 will light up a bright orange color, doing this allows you to keep your place in a game mode you were in. You can also power off your ps5 if you don’t want that option, and the other option was that you could simply restart your ps5. When you Ps5 you will have a bright blue led light that lets you know it's on.One con of this product is that if your tv isn’t that good you won’t be able to see it for the full experience. You can play games but some games only allow you to play ps4 games only on the ps4. Some games that you play might be taken away because the deal with that company stopped.Also from time to time the controller will have stick drift which is very annoying. The trigger effects if not used right can break your controller if you press down too hard.In conclusion I would give this product a 9 out of 10. The reason why I say this is because everything is amazing but some features shouldn't be able to break a controller you bought and then you have to pay more money for a new one. Overall I love the 120 fps feature which is amazing and I never expected it to be possible with a console! If you buy this product make sure you have all the features you need like tv I would suggest a 144hz monitor or a 4k tv. OTher than that the product is really well built.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"December 8, 2021",Aden Collins moore,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEGR2OYFAZN2TGXNVTS3JFPJ2HLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,False

514,PlayStation 5 Console,The Best Console to Date,"As a gamer of about 30 years (I started young), I've had almost every console throughout the generations. Obviously, things get better with time (graphics, loading time, design, games, etc.). The PS5 is a real leap forward in so many ways. It was hard to envision how the PS5 was going to be better than PS4 (knowing we're reaching graphical thresholds). I think games like Horizon, Returnal, Demon's Souls remake, Ratchet and Clank, and others have really showed the pure power of this system. The load times alone were worth the upgrade for me, and although we're slow to start in this generation, as well keep PS4 in mind, I think within the next year, as God of War , Forspoken, and others arrive, we will start seeing the real potential of this machine.To the 1-star reviewers talking about shipment and stock issues - that is not a review of the console and should be taken down by Amazon.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"May 26, 2022",M.

516,PlayStation 5 Console,Great Console.  Infuriating customer support.  De facto ransomware.,"All the great things about this console are well-established.  I will tell you a few things that might give you pause. 1) Something random went wrong with my console, and it now boots to a safe mode menu with every option greyed out except ""Reset PS5 (Reinstall System Software).""  I tried contacting PS Support through chat.  Once I was finally connected with an agent, the agent immediately closed the chat, before interacting with me in any way.  I tried to go to chat again, and received a message that said ""Hey there, back so soon?, it seems Chat has not been of help to you, please try again tomorrow.""2) As of launch, there was no way to backup saves to usb, they had to be put in the cloud, using PS Plus.  For people who don't care for multiplayer, and prefer to choose their own games rather than playing whatever PS Plus decides to ""give away for free,"" PS Plus is a poor value.  It amounts to an insurance system for protecting your own (save) data, that over the course of a console cycle, costs as much as actually paying to retrieve your PC data from a ransomware user.

517,PlayStation 5 Console,Really noisy,"I finally got one of these, but within an hour of use I realized I would have to return it as I could not tolerate the loud high pitch wavering ufo like noise coming from the fan. It wasn’t coil whine as it was a different type of noise, and it also did not make the noise in sleep mode. I have owned a fat ps2 and a launch ps4 as well as various other consoles and pcs over the years so it’s not like I went in expecting silence. Like the fan noise of the ps4 might be louder in decibels than the ps5, but the high pitch frequency of the ps5 makes it totally unlivable to me. It was actually painful being in the same room with it even when it was doing nothing but sitting on the Home Screen.When I looked into it I found out that Sony uses 3 different types of fans in the ps5, and the brand that I got is known for making the high pitch ufo noise. The ps5 is still scarce even though it’s been out for 2 years already, and possibly 1/3rd of them are manufactured with the “bad” fan type. So I chose to get an Xbox instead of going through the hassle of returning systems until I could find one with one of the other two brands of fan that doesn’t make the ufo noise.Pretty disappointed in the lack of quality/care coming from Sony. It’s a perfectly nice console if you either get lucky and get one of the quiet ones, or are not sensitive to high pitch noises.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"September 12, 2022",Echo,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGDYCOFCQL62MHNKR3JV75BDN5JA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,False
518,PlayStation 5 Console,Not worth the wait,"After 2 long years of waiting I finally got my mitts on a PS5 and all I can say is meh.I've had every Playstation console ever made (yeah I'm extremely extremely wealthy what of it???) and this is by far the least exciting of all of them.  Here are my 1st impressions of each console1. PS1: disc's? What kind of wizardry is this??? This thing is awesome! Somebody give me a surge and a pack of gushers, time to celebrate!2. PS2: whoa the graphics rule, way better than that wack a** PS1! Give me a Faygo, time ro celebrate (this was during my juggalo phase)3. PS3: the graphical improvements keep on a'comin!! Give me a 40oz, time to celebrate (this was during my raging alcoholic phase)!!!4. PS4: will it ever end, how do these consoles keep blowing away the previous ones??? Give me a bag full of drugs, time to celebrate (I was having some personal issues at the time, but the PS4 was the entertainment intervention I needed)!!!5. PS5: this is it? I can barely tell the difference.  This literally looks exactly like PS4 graphics.  Somebody give me an ensure, I no longer have the will to live.So there you go. The PS5 is such a disappointment.  This did not justify being a whole new console or a $500 price tag. This should have been called the PS4.2 or something.  It's a slight tiny improvement over the last version.  Seriously they should have made it some kind of siamese add-on like the sega-cd or Sega Saturn back in the day. Too young to remember that you gen z punk? Well let me put it in language you can understand no cap on god that mf'er was not bussin fr..Why is the PS5 such a joke?  Let me count the ways. Five is in the name so it's 5 reasons I give1. The graphics: I'm not even sure they are any better. People tell me they are so I guess my own ocular receptacles must be filthy liars. Looks exactly the same to me. And before you get your panties in a wad, yes I'm playing on a 4k TV and all that sh**. Settle down nerd.2. The console size: When I say this thing is huge, I mean this thing is huge. You could hollow one out and house a homeless dude inside.  Why would you want to do that? Good question...you wouldn't.  The homeless can't be trusted but neither can Sony.Can't be trusted with designing a console that isn't big enough for a homeless man to....oh wait I already went thru that. Seriously though there is a homeless man who hangs around outside my house all day and it's got me all in a tizzy, apologies.3. The wait: If I got this thing day 1 then my disappointment still would have been immense, but not this epic.4. The price: ok the price was pretty standard for a new console but I'm running out of ideas and feel like I shouldn't have promised 5 criticisms.5. The homeless man living outside my house:  was he drawn here by the hypnotizing glow of the PS5 thru the window? It's possible.  Unlikely, but still possible.So yeah.  Five solid reasons why you should avoid this thing like the plague. Just wait for the PS6. Which I'm sure will blow too.

522,PlayStation 5 Console,Great new addition to the family,"I was one of the lucky few who received an invitation from PlayStation Network to buy a PS5 and have it delivered on the release date. Since I received the PS5 it has consistently been put to use and I haven’t noticed any factory bugs as of yet. I have enjoyed the PS5 since then and have great things to say in regards to the total experience. Now, it isn’t all a basket of roses and I’ll get to that later in the review. My first impression of the console was the design was lackluster, however it quickly grew on me. Especially with the new additions of the customizable shells in various colors. My favorite feature of the new PS5 is the controller with haptic feedback. This is a great feature with a lot of potential which hasn’t been fully realized yet by game developers. The new user interface took some getting used to but I enjoy the appearance and layout more than the PS4. The GPU and RAM are very comparable to its biggest competitor. I mainly play on the performance setting combined with a TV that has a high enough refresh rate to keep up. This has proven to be a marked upgrade from the previous console and will only get better as game developers start to utilize the full potential. The area where this falters is in the hard drive which is lacking in size at around 700 gigabytes of usable space. I’ve found this to fill up much too quickly. In this day and age it should have been too costly for Sony to add a bigger hard drive. Another issue with this console is scarcity and the difficulty some are having to get their hands on one. Scalpers using bots have also made this issue an even bigger problem with inflated prices. The last issue which is possible but hasn’t been fully realized yet is Microsoft buying up some of the best and biggest game studios. Sony does have some good console exclusives but Microsoft has the ability to now make some of the very best games into Microsoft exclusives. All in all I would recommend this console to those who can get their hands on one.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"February 17, 2022",William Bottorf,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHTMIIWP3CZUJ6ZAS3LL6OLHISYA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,False
523,PlayStation 5 Console,1 Year Review,"I was one of the lucky ones to get this the first month and have had it since and here are my thoughts.Pros: I only had the base PS4 since 2014 and is a major upgrade in terms of loading times, menu access, and free PS5 upgrades from PS4 games ( depending on the company and game ) so that's mainly 60 FPS (Frames Per Second).It is easier to clean the PS5, The system is super quiet compared to the fan of a PS4.The UI interface is a major upgrade making it easier to access apps, settings, games, etc.Cons:The controller is amazing but the adaptive triggers have a flimsy coil that will break if you put too much pressure on it, mine's been broke 2 months after use and a new one is $69 or send it in and wait a couple weeks. It also has a major drift problem where it aims in a certain direction because of it's dated hardware and is frustrating, especially if you play multiplayer games. I had the PS4 controller since launch and never had any problem with it and I have problems with the new controllers and took 2 months for problems to occur.In short, flimsy hardware for an advanced controller.Storage is little compared to the games made today. it is 667 GB and that's small if you have a big collection of PS4 and PS5 games. Mind you games like Call of Duty is 200 GB. Luckily there is a storage upgrade but it can range a couple hundred dollars so that's based on your preference.The PS5 is worth buying but not for the price above $500 and I hope everyone will be able to get there hands on one of these soon.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"November 23, 2021",Isaiah Medellin,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEZ4MKTCGOXQ3XFAVAPVZIL7224Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,False

532,PlayStation 5 Console,Storage Wars,"Although the PlayStation 5 is a fantastic console, there are some aspects that the Xbox Series X may have the upper hand. The PlayStation is equipped with about 680 gigabytes of useable storage for users. On the other hand, the Xbox comes standard with a 1 terabyte SSD allowing for more storage for games and apps instead of having to decide which games you need to delete to download a new game.Sony has taken this flaw into account. They have included an internal SSD port into the console for users to expand storage. Some SSD cards can get pricy though ranging from 100-800 dollars depending on the storage size and speed of the card. Sony was able to make the flaw of less storage and be able to make the console even better because most SSD cards while adding storage also increase download speeds, which on the PS5 is already fast.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"February 1, 2022",Unknown,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH73DWMECFTBZMVTHJVAUJZM3HZQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,False

535,PlayStation 5 Console,Not a normal review,"So obviously I got the ps5 for myself and it is a fantastic machine.  Awesome games, great features, reasonably priced etc etc.  but it shines most for me is with one of my little girls.  She suffers from autism and many things we take for granted she struggles with.  The relevant thing here being her fine motor skills.  The ps5 has a pack-in game called Astro’s playroom and my little one adores it.  She can barely speak but I often get a “I want playroom” from her and it’s a little miracle as this game is designed to show off the new controller, but since she loves the game, it actually gets her to use and develop those fine motor skills.  She’s using the touchpad, tilting the controller left or right, learning pressure sensitivity with the buttons, just a plethora of things that’s exponentially increasing the tool set she has to become more independent.

Less than a week later, it was already refusing to turn on and/or connect to my Sony Bravia tv.  The troubleshooting process is worse than useless, as the console only communicates through lights on the chassis, and my typical pattern — blue, flashing white, solid white, orange, nothing — doesn’t even appear in the user manual.  Rebuilding the database, safe mode, none of them did a thing.  This is a $500 machine that is less reliable and much uglier than my $20 alarm clock.  The chassis even feels cheap, like a poorly designed blender.  I own every PlayStation all the way back to the PS1, and all of them still work great to this day — except the one I got last week.

556,PlayStation 5 Console,"This is partly a review of the PS5 as a console, but a 1-star ding on retail ineptitude.","First, the PS5 gets a 4-star review from me, I was able to play a unit from one of those lucky family members that spend 24/7 clicking reload once per minute during restock announcements.  It is unarguably the best current generation.  The raw CPU and GPU performance are very noticeable, but it a decent internal sub-storage unit with more capacity would've been a win.  Sadly, the library has yet to grow to a point to make it a considerable investment.  It was good of many development houses to provide ""free"" upgrades to many PS4 generation games, but I'm hoping to see new offerings of the heavy hitting IPs on the console.On that note, the ONE STAR is handed to the business practices of the online retail market.  You are not protecting consumers enough and allow shady scalpers to sweep the stock using bots and then reselling for obscenely inflated prices.  These same scalpers use Amazon's lenient return policy to ensure that they don't lose any money, and then re-buy the same units for retail price once again.  Scalping isn't illegal, but it's morally ambiguous.  I will wait for as long as necessary to get a unit at the retail price.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"June 6, 2022",L.

Only unplugged and replugged in the hdmi cord twice and was very careful.Issue 3: Frequent issues the games becoming corrupted causing to have to be completely uninstalled, reinstalled and still may not help. currently performing a factory reset because have had to redownload all of my games multple times without resolve. You can only redownload an 90GB game before you are extremely aggravated.Issue 4: Controller headphone ports are fragile. I accidently put maybe 2-3lb of pressure on the headphone jack and completely broke the port. Cheap plastic.Issue 5: Consistent Issue with Adapataive triggers. Some games work well, and some games make it completely obnoxious to play. I have had to turn off this feature in multiple games because of poor optimization.Issue 6: Controller Vibtations cause audible sounds from inside the controller and sometimes don't work as intended and consistently vibrate unless you turn the controller off completely.Likely my last Playstation product and will switching over to Microsoft Series X soon.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"June 17, 2022",RoyOP,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFGERJIFAKMX2FXWOSZKW4FMAJIQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,False

I refuse to pay $200+ to someone who sits around waiting for them to drop, buys multiple and then flips it for a quick dollar. The ps5 is honestly hyped up more than what it really is. The controllers are well known to get stick drift & bad charging within the first 1.5 years of using it. And to replace the controller with a new one is expensive. There's very limited games for the ps5 alone (to have the full ps5 experience) and the headphones are trash. They hurt your head/ears after awhile and will break over time. Period. It's really sad to see people fighting and upselling this console bc Sony only puts out a limited amount every so often. If you look at the gross amount of PS consoles sold over the years starting from the very first one made, the ps5 doesn't even scratch the surface of the amount made/sold. Why create something for the masses but only have very few. I have so many thoughts on this.

580,PlayStation 5 Console,WORTH 250 DOLLARS!!!! AND MADE FOR 1 PERSON REALLY!!!!!,I purchased a PS5 March 2021 and had it for about 8 months now. At first me and my brother were so excited but then realized it was supremely over hyped. Well we stopped playing it mainly when we discovered we could only store about 5 games max on the PS5. After this it became extremely unappealing to play because we would have to delete games to play others. It wasnt even worth it because we had to spend an extra 500$ to install extra storage which is the price of the PS5. Also because sometimes the PS5 would have data corruption problems that would cause you to have to factor reset it and it would really freak you out to know you might have to return it and PS5 are really scarce. Makes you think you might never get it back. Overall the PS5 is a horrible gaming system because they should have been created with 2 Terebytes of storage since games occupy at least 100gb a piece.

697,PlayStation 5 Console,Designed by advanced alien race 🤔😀🙂?????,"First let me say the bad jokes😀. When I first held it, I said what the heck is this? Is it an encyclopedia britanica? Is it a chopping block or giant cutting board? Is it a giant bible?From the design alone I love the PS5 Disc Model. When I look at it, I feel like I have a carefully designed trophy in my room. It looks so technically advanced including the controller. The UI, home page music, navigating the menus, everything is so smooth. It doesn’t get loud. Setting up the PS5 is a breeze and not long.The 2TB memory expansion is a must-have. Let me say if SONY had of added a 2TB SSD, the PS5 would have easily cost around $650 to $700 probably. These memory expansions are not cheap but very worth it. Also adding the memory expansion is a breeze. I much rather have the memory expansion securely enclosed instead of sticking out where it can get damaged.The first game I bought? You guessed it. FFVII REMAKE INTERMISSION PS5 version. This reminds of the first time I bought a PS and FFVII. Now history is repeating itself. I ABSOLUTELY WANT THE FFVII REMAKE PARTS 2,3, and 4 👍. From the first mission to the first battle in chapter 1, I was hooked. And lost track of time.I’m looking forward to the future games and life of the PS5. I hope SONY treats the PS5 well.

747,Xbox Series S,Next Gen Console a love letter to the customers,"To be clear Xbox Series S is next gen! it can game in 4K & play games at 120 FPS !!For parents to help out if buying for kidsXbox one S is previous gen! Note it says Xbox “one” S. Some previous gen Xbox consoles have “one” in the name.  It’s Xbox, Xbox 360, Xbox One, now Xbox Series X/S.The newest generation of Xbox consoles all have “Series” X or S in the name.Series X is the black bigger consoleSeries S is the white smaller consoleThe Xbox Series S…. It’s small, takes up little space and is powerful. The Series S can out preform the Series X in some departments like keeping 60 frames per second during challenging experiences for the console to run. The Series X wins in little things like draw distances and seeing a slightly better resolution, but at times could drop the frame rate. But they are pretty much the same next gen experience just two options for customers. What’s the biggest difference?Microsoft made a way for players not to miss out on next gen experience due to not being able to afford it! If you want next gen and also to save some money the Series S was made for you!! But if you want the full experience the Series X was made for you!! Series X wins for storage but Series S can allow 20 or more decent sized games plus don’t forget you can use cloud gaming for a lot of games you don’t want to download.Game pass cloud feature you can play games within seconds not having to download / install anything.I’ve tested the Series X and Series S and it’s barley a difference. I’m able to pick up and resume my save data from Series X to Series S no problem. Gears of war 5 or WWE 2k22 for example are just about the same on both.Series X - more storage, physical games CAN be played. Slightly better resolution. Loading time differences are to be within seconds nothing wild to report.Series S - Digital only! Meaning no physical games can be played. WiFi is required to set up and download games. Once it’s fully updated and games are downloaded it can be used offline but WiFi is needed to first set up the console and download games!!Series S should not be put down or downplayed, more information should be out there to help customers know this is truly next gen. The Series S is easier to find and it’s nothing wrong with it.Example of storage. Series S. Currently have6 Xbox series X/S optimized games installed, 9 Xbox one games installed,3 Xbox 360 games installed1 Xbox (original console) game installed.Still have 52 GB free !!Downloading my library from Xbox one (previous generation Xbox) to Series S was super easy via the Xbox app. (Available on Google play android and iOS App Store) Much easier than Sony PlayStation has been. Xbox wants you to keep your library and keeps giving added backwards compatibility! I’m so happy with my Series S and don’t even care about the Series X anymore. It’s the same thing to me with little differences that aren’t worth the price difference. And not to every gamer it will be worth the price difference.  The loading and quick resume give new life into last gen games that had long loading times ! Something like UFC 4 gets a lovely FPS boost along with Far Cry 5 and many others. Games you’ve already paid for are upgraded and new games will slowly unlock the true power of your purchase. You won’t be needing to trade the Series S in for an upgrade because it will be able to run the new titles and keep up just fine!It’s even small enough for different delivery options ! I got my Xbox delivered to a local stores locker ! It was super light to carry and didn’t come in a box revealing what’s inside thankfully.If you deeply care about 4 to 5 extra bushes and a pinch more draw distance that doesn’t make a difference to the degree that you wouldn’t be able to react. Like a driving game you’ll be able to have the same experience on both consoles same game just the series x might have slightly more available to see in the distance.  If storage is that important to y’all  or resolution go with the X. But if you want next gen and don’t need the extra storage, don’t care about physical games, and want to save money go with the Series S.Don’t miss out on next gen waiting out for the normal priced Series X if the S is available.This review is to help others understand the difference between the many names of Xbox consoles and see if the Series S is the best option. If not some information about the Xbox Series X is in my review to help to decide. Also to help parents out to make the right purchase for a potential surprise gift!Reviews are always designed to help out others and I hope it has been clear to help out others!!!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"June 29, 2022",Mr. Campbell,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHJY5GQKEAJRGTCQKS5MQ6DI7I4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True
748,Xbox Series S,Plenty of power and very compact!,"To start, I purchased this for my wife while I myself got the series X. Only because I do much more gaming and thought I’d need the better system…boy was I wrong. This little console appears to pack as much punch as my series X. I honestly couldn’t tell a difference when running the same game. The graphics are great and so is the load times. I personally sold my series X and got one of these. Due to it’s small stature it fit my setup way better than the bulkier series X. Other than the HDD being smaller there wasn’t any reason in my opinion to have the series X when this worked just as well. Again this is my opinion. I definitely recommend getting the series S if you’re interested in a new gen console.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"October 25, 2022",Ronnie,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF7TXGUACZUPIQCNMY677ZTE27SA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

The only issue I see with this console, is the weak storage space.  Not sure why Microsoft thought in it's infinite wisdom to only include 500GB (364GB) storage, but they screwed that up.

778,Xbox Series S,La mejor consola calidad precio que puedas comprar,"Nunca tuve una compañía favoritas en consolas,  es pasado por todas las generaciones de Playstation, xbox. Y nintendo pero nunca había tenido la experiencia de poder jugar cualquier juego que se me plazca y la experiencia ha sido la mejor. No tengo ninguna queja de la experiencia que te puede brindar la consola y de hecho es la mitad de un ps4 prácticamente.Gracias a su tamaño me la he podido llevar para todos los lugares que he viajado, incluso un día me porque pensé que no estaba en la mochila, pero como es demasiado pequeña no la note al principio.El control es una pasada de cómodo, he venido del ps4 y la diferencia es buena, me gusta muchísimo como se siente. La calidad de materiales todo está demasiado bien y me sorprende el precio que la venden y el stock qué hay.Si no tienes y tampoco deseas comprar una tv4k en el futuro, definitivamente esta es tu consola, la calidad de juegos se ven demasiado bien teniendo una tv 1080p. Si tienes una tv4k te recomiendo que te vayas por la Xbox series x para exprimir de verdad el rendimiento que tiene. Pero si no posees una tv de ese calibre, para qué gastar tanto si puedes obtener algo bueno con lo que tienes?Muchos de la comunidad sana, hablan mal por qué el control no tiene pilas, pero es porque no saben que existe algo que se llama baterías recargables de 2600. Son una gozada y me dura más de 4 o 5 días. A veces hasta una semana cuando juego una hora por día.Tiene un almacenamiento de 500gb, en parte es muy poco pero puedes comprarte un ssd o hdd económico de 60 dólares y tienes 2tb!

No overheating issues. However I do wanna make it clear that this option Xbox S Series IS an Xbox One BUT does NOT have a slot for game discs and you cannot play DVDs or Blu-ray is on it. So if you’re looking to buy a line for your children to share their disc games on this is not the option for you.

Games load very fast. Graphics are slightly better than those on the Xbox One.The only downside is that it has 375GB of available space. With some AAA games coming in at 120GB+ you may find your self juggling SSD space for keep more than a handful of games installed.

I love it, and it works fine but 4 stars not 5 is because they did a really pathetic job packaging my shipment. I had to import this as the country I live in is out of stock, always, so it had a long way to travel. They threw it in a box with a ton of extra space and NO padding of any kind. When it got to me the box looked 20+ years old from being banged up so bad. It looked like what you'd expect original hardware retro console boxes to look like, like if you bought a sega genesis used. I like to keep my console boxes and display them and this was very disappointing. But more importantly, we are VERY lucky my series S was not damaged. It easily could have been.

Not true 4k gaming but as someone who’s career depends on my eyesight I assure you 1080p is no different then 4k unless you’re running on a monitor. Series s ($300) + 42” TCL Roku tv ($278) + the cooling towers that come with rechargeable controller batteries ($40-$60)make a solid $650 investment on a nice gaming set up. $650 is the same price as a series X these day just some food for thought. Also if you can choose get atleast the medium level spectrum plan. At a solid 80-150 mps DL rate I’ve never even had a problem especially playing Xbox on my phone while my old lady watches Netflix on the same tv.

To me the graphics is fine, performance is excellent. The only thing I may be missing is 120hz and guess what I don’t own a 120hz tv anywaysGamepass is where the goodies are at.

811,Xbox Series S,I love it!!!,"I've been always a PlayStation/PC user, and with a PC I always thought that having an Xbox is kinda useless since most of games are on both platforms. I promised myself that I would buy this Xbox Series S as soon as I see it on stock again, the reason? Xbox Gamepass, I know it's on PC too, but I consider Xbox Gamepass on an Xbox is something ever bigger, you'll feel like a kid on a candy shop, so many games to pick, probably limited by storage but it's all about how you manage it, the best part is that Gamepass can be used on PC and Xbox, the same subscription, that's something great if you're a PC user too, you'll be able to run games at a better frame rate on your PC but also enjoy Gamepass games that went only to console. I consider this console as a great deal, even if you're a PC user you won't regret, I really hope Xbox continues offering such a great service and adding more games to the service, if you take a look to what's coming on Xbox on the next years, especially for Gamepass, you'll realize that even if you're a PC user this is a great purchase and if you don't own a PC and don't mind playing at 1080p/1440p once you subscribe to Xbox Gamepass you won't regret your purchase.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"April 1, 2022",Cristhian A.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFJ7RE4UBMTJYXI6U767HISNALQQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

821,Xbox Series S,"I like it, however....","I should have waited until more games I was interested in came out. I bought this console because finding a PS5 for sale sold for it's original price at best was a living nightmare. I wanted to get back to my roots and return back to playstation, but sadly this pandemic and people buying multiple consoles to sell them for over a thousand dollars made me consider the new gen Xbox. The Xbox Series X was always sold out leaving me with a surprisingly affordable Xbox Series S. After 2 full months of playing on this console the quality is actually very good. The time it takes for me to reach the login screen was less than 5 seconds and it takes less than 15 seconds to get back into my game. The main problem, unfortunately is not the console, but the games. I find myself uninterested in a lot of the newer games and the ones I was interested in have very poor reviews.In conclusion, a lot of the games I want can also be played on my Xbox one. Because of that I feel that I had acted to quickly in buying this console. My Xbox one have more memory space than this and I could continue playing games that have to be inserted in (disk). I eventually unplugged my Xbox Series S to continue using the Xbox One until something great comes out. I am keeping my fingers crossed that the upcoming games or games that either just came out like Elden Ring don't disappoint in reviews.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"February 25, 2022",Jay H.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFROL2EVWRG66IIHSZV6653ITY7A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True
822,Xbox Series S,Great little GamePass box,"Love the small form factor of the XBOX Series S and the games look great upscaled on my 4K UHD TV set.  TBH, I picked mine up after using GamePass PC for several months and liked it and wanted to access it from a next gen console.  I wanted a Series X but couldn’t get one, so settled for an S.  I can’t pop in one of my old disks from my previous OG Xbox or 360, but most are available on GamePass or as digital purchase anyway.Pros- small and unobtrusive, games look great and even old games have visual and FOS improvements, very quiet, remote play is great, instant access through streaming surprisingly good, you can download games remotely using GamePass app. fast load times, quick resume.Cons - insufficient internal storage (you WILL need an expansion card or external storage after a while), gimped visuals and performance compared to Series X, user interface not intuitive - 360 and PS4 way better, no disk drive so no Blu-Ray movies or physical game disk.Other thoughts- I was using an external USB HDD for a while but new games won’t run from it (old games do).  I eventually decided to spring for the Seagate internal expansion card for $200, so consider this in your cost assessment.  Also exceeded my data limit with Xfinity in February for the first time ever downloading games, so don’t download everything at once.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"March 6, 2022",Savage,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF7MARZUNUTNUDOCTPABI2J6XUQQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

824,Xbox Series S,If not using a 2k dollar TV this is will please you.,Wow this little thing is powerful! I purchased it for my wife for her 18 wheeler on her down times so we can game together. I play on the series X and there is no difference when on a subpar TV but when I play on my LG TV the series x is definitely a hundred times better! Also the only drawback is digital of course which is fine for her but alot of my games the disc versions are 80% cheaper than the digital version. Hopefully this won't be an issue soon with the new patent from Microsoft to authenticate discs to download digitally to the series S. Honestly if I did not have a 3000$ Qled TV I would have gotten an S as well. I also put this thing threw rigorous gaming sessions with no overheating issues at all!!!! Good job Microsoft 👏.

827,Xbox Series S,Excellent,"This is without a doubt the best and most exciting next generation console simply because it's deceptively capable and so easily within reach of nearly anyone who might be reading this. Yes, it's not top of the line, no, it doesn't have the most storage, but NO, neither of these things matter much if you're using a good 1080p screen. Lots of games perform within a stone's throw of PS5 frame rates and when you're in motion it can be hard to see the difference between it and its big brother.I have two of these, one for the living room, another for the kids play room and a Series X.

830,Xbox Series S,Robust and budget piece of fun.,"Before buying Xbox S I had a Playstation 4 slim, which I enjoyed much. Unfortunately it's gone after my flat was flooded by flat from above.So as alternative, after doing some research, I stopped on Xbox S series and start to wait restocking. Finally I've got my piece of fun. Xbox S for 299.99 is a good price. I am not 4k, 100 FPS type of guy, I just enjoy games and having fun. So for me Xbox S doing its job: A+ (excellent)As for design, it can fit to almost any room or furniture style, thanks to its classic, rectangle shape and white color: A+ (excellent). AND you can place it horizontally or vertically, which gives more opportunitiea to fit it.Software, internal management: A+ (excellent)Memory: B+ (above good), there is definitely room for improvement, 512 GB would be filled by 6-7 games. But from other side, it is fair for 299 price.Heat management is better then Xbox 360 haha: A (very good). Of course its fan located place is heated, but no rocket start ignition temperatures.Joystick: C (satisfactory)I was a dissapointed by it's joystick. Maaan, it feels, sounds and looks so chinese-cheap. Xbox button is sticking sometimes, I mean you press it, but it sticks and do not go back (you can see on pics).Rear battery cover is thin and bends a little when you pull it out. I am expecting this will be broken after 70-80 battery changes.So in total: 4 stars. I am enjoying my Xbox S series do not get me wrong. Really want to put 5 stars, but everytime I pick joystick, I wish Xbox S series costs 20 dollars more, but it's joystick has a pleasent grip, better look, better designed buttons.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"December 28, 2021",Sanjar,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFQB33WR4OR7GPBEC2LOR5I2QS7Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

840,Xbox Series S,Can't beat for the price!,"First off, I'm a Playstation guy... I currently own & play on a PS5. I've always wanted to play Forza Horizon and also revisit my childhood and play killer instinct as well, and both titles are Xbox exclusive so I finally purchased the Xbox series S , my very first Microsoft console. This little fella is great! I actually ignored my PS5 for a month and played only Xbox series S and loved it during my free game pass trial, minus the silly controller needing batteries lol. I'm super happy with my first Xbox as a secondary console however,  $15 a month for ""game pass ultimate "" is not a good deal for me as the 100 games in the library I either own already, played already or simply don't have any interest. It's more expensive to play online multi-player on Xbox than on Playstation,  plus the Xbox controller is trash for fighting games (my main genre) as the D Pad is way too small and controller is just goofy, like it was made for small children as the PS5 controller is rather large and feels good in hand..so for these reasons PS5 will remain my go-to console and this series S will be an awesome back up console, well worth $299",5.0 out of 5 stars,"March 3, 2022",Alexander,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHQTWVCCBML6OZ566IYX7CQXHHGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

842,Xbox Series S,Best console I've ever owned.,"Grew up with nintendo , played the ps4 and switch in my adult life and love both those systems. They set the bar high for quality at an affordable price....and then the series s leaped over that bar like magikarp! Loads everything faster, including streaming services, games are quick so you spend less time waiting and more time playing. What used to take a minute to load now literally only takes less than 10 seconds at most. Otherwise its 3 seconds to load most games. Quick resume is a God send for someone like me who jumps from game to game, so I can in seconds resume playing one game then go to another. Looks very futuristic and sounds like a next gen console with the menu sound effects. But most importantly, makes games look and play better. With 4k options and the ability to run most games at 60 fps, its is a gamers wet dream. To think the switch and this gem of console are the same price is really mind boggling to me and I don't know how Microsoft was able to do it, but they did it, and absolutely nailed it!

847,Xbox Series S,Best Next Gen Deal on the Market,"If you have game pass you'll never need another console again since this will easily cover everything from next-gen to 360. The 500 gigs of storage are annoying, but with the streaming feature on game pass, you save a lot of space. The hardware is fast and consistent, and the controller is sleek and feels great to use (even as an ex-ps4 player). The price also can't be beaten, especially considering how well it runs next-gen and X|S specialized games. Honestly, unless you have a 4/8k tv there's no reason to go with the series X over the S since you won't even be able to recognize the difference. So far after a month of use I have nothing but praise for the little thing; it's tiny, powerful, and cheap, so honestly what more could you ask for?

850,Xbox Series S,Great deal for next gen gaming,"$300 for a next gen console is a great deal, I know a lot of people will argue that you are missing out on a lot by having only 2k resolution instead of 4k, however, I can tell you that 2k scales incredibly well in a 4k screen, and most of the time you will barely notice the difference unless you have a 60 inch TV or something huge like that. Either way, it is a great deal and if you add gamepass, it is the best deal to have a next gen console and library ready for you to play whatever you want. Microsoft just recently bought activision so, if you like Shooters, you will have COD, Overwatch, Doom, Gears and Halo all in the same subscription.If I have to complaint about something it would be the storage, 512 is really not as much as you think at first, new games are... BIG, even the smaller ones are more than 50gb each, and things like Forza is over 100gb, with that, you will have just a few games in your console at the time, that is the only reason I am dropping one star, if it had twice as much storage, it would be easily 5 stars",4.0 out of 5 stars,"January 28, 2022",Amazon Customer,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AERNSRQHCXKJ7AHWB4FCBRWTDJXQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

853,Xbox Series S,The perfect next gen console for PC players,"I have been debating for a long time whether to go with the shiny series X or the better priced and easier to find series S. And boy did I make the right decision. So just for a little context I primarily play on PC, but wanted an Xbox because not all games are cross platform compatible. I have many friends that still just casually play on Xbox. This was the perfect addition to my set up. What impressed me the most about it was being at such a low price point compared to the series X the load times are incredible. Yes, the storage might only be 512 GB but if you have good enough Internet cloud gaming is always a great option. Overall I would recommend this to any casual player or anyone looking to add to their PC set up. 10 out of 10 !",5.0 out of 5 stars,"April 19, 2022",baileycarithers,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHULCHXSI4ZFW3QHBXPN6MJBGQLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

858,Xbox Series S,Best Console You Can Buy - Literally!,"This is the best console you can buy at the moment at MSRP because, well, it’s the only console!Jokes aside, this console really is great. I love the smaller form factor and it runs games incredibly well at 1080p-1440p. I know most focus is on the Series X but I do think the Series S is an equally capable gaming machine and deserves a bit more love.One thing to note: I definitely recommend a 1TB supplemental storage device (whether that’s the Seagate PCIE 4 expansion or a USB  SSD) because you will fill the 320 GB of usable space on this console very quickly.Obviously the Seagate PCIE 4 expansion card will have a bit more longevity given it’ll run all games you download but you can save a good amount by getting a 1TB USB HDD or SSD and then moving the games in and out of internal storage as needed. To be honest this is what I’m doing as I’ve already got a USB 1TB SSD and it’s not as big a deal as I thought it would be. The transfers for most games between internal and external storage is only 5mins or so, which isn’t bad.Anyway this already a long winded review, but to sum it up: I love this console! 5/5 would buy again!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"February 1, 2022",Brandon,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFXFS3CKMEXBRVONBFPF45A5EPXA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

860,Xbox Series S,Fantastic Value,"I have always been a Playstation guy, but after being unable to find a PS5 for a reasonable price and seeing all the acquisitions Microsoft has been making, I decided to give this a shot. I planned to use it as a secondary console, but I have absolutely fallen in love with my Series S. The power for the price mixed with Gamepass and backwards compatibility (which I never knew I needed until I had it lol) has left me more than satisfied with my purchase. The lack of a disc drive is a little bit of a bummer, but I knew it did not have one going in, so I'm not upset about it. I would highly recommend this console to anyone who does not feel like waiting for God knows how long for the Series X or PS5 to be widely available and/or is okay with the lack of a disc drive and a little less power than the other 2 consoles. I would  recommend either getting an expansion card or external HDD if you play a lot of games, though, as the storage on the SSD will not hold that many.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"February 28, 2022",Charles King,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AELAOC67XQU6JX2EOSKKJBV7PGYA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

862,Xbox Series S,Great Game Pass machine for the price!,"Honestly can't beat the price for what you get with the Series S and a game pass ultimate subscription.  I don't collect physical media for Xbox platforms so I didn't feel it was necessary to leap for the Series X for that reason.  It is a fast, responsive piece of hardware that really performs above my expectations. It comes as an amazingly small form factor which is refreshing as my PS5 is enormous and takes up a lot of space.  I have encountered no issues while playing it.  Performance-wise I have encountered some minor artifacting when playing some games such as Quantum Break.  Side by side with the PS5 it is obviously outperformed but I'm not really playing Xbox for graphically intense games.  I love the Game Pass economy and this gets me access to all of that.  It comes with 512GB of NVMe SSD storage, which seems on the lower end as the Series X comes with 1TB but I really haven't run into issue with it as I don't typically play large file sized games. I could and probably will purchase the Seagate Expansion card at some point but I don't feel that is necessary at this time.A note for the shipment packaging:  the package arrived with a dent along the top of the box that was pretty severe.  As you can see in my pictures, the damage to the items packaging could have been avoided by added another air pack along the top and right side.  Luckily, Microsoft was smart with their internal packaging to avoid any damage to the xbox itself. Where the dent extends into the packaging is where the controller, HDMI cord, power cord, and batteries are.4 stars for my overall rating of the Series S, 2 stars for packaging on Amazon's part.Lovely system, I will buy the next upgrade if or when it's ever sold for the digital only Xbox.

872,Xbox Series S,Love this little console,"This was my entry into next gen console gaming and I couldn't be happier.  The loading times are excellent (and often on-existent)  and Xbox Game Pass has an excellent selection of games available for download.  Good sales are frequent on the Xbox store, counterbalancing the lack of an optical drive to use with used games.  Select games even run at 120FPS.  The controller is the best one I've ever used; I love the d-pad because it's so clicky and precise. I use mine on my PC and at times my Switch (via an adapter) in addition to the Xbox.  The space is more limited, but I've not had any problems transferring games I don't play as much to a USB-3.1 hard drive for cold storage (or just deleting them if I don't think I'll play them again). I've had this console for over a year now and I'm very pleased.  It gets significantly more play than my Switch does.

898,Xbox Series S,So much fun,"My son wanted a next gen console and a friend who was a lot more into gaming than me recommended an Xbox Series S. I tried finding an X or a PS5 and just decided after reading it wasn’t worth it. There are some good articles from serious gamers on why they like the S for its next gen capabilities, slimmer profile, and friendly price. We’ve had so much fun with it and my son is very satisfied with it. The Tv it’s on can only do 1440p so it’s perfect for the S. Even if I had a 4K tv connected to it I’d be satisfied as I don’t think the graphic quality difference would be materially noticeable. With Game Pass Ultimate we’ve been able to play Forza 5 and other games. And there are the free to play games like Fortnite at 60 fps and Rocket League that are lots of fun. I was concerned about the smaller hard drive but now I see Microsoft beta offering the cloud streaming games and the ones I’ve tried have worked well. I anticipate that’ll become more common and it’ll minimize the need for a bigger hard drive. If your son or daughter wants a next gen console and doesn’t need a disc drive for older games I’d say go for it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"December 11, 2021",Dan W,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGX6GBUYXAWL35YF4FLUPTSONYSQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

904,Xbox Series S,Good Next-Gen Experience but…,"This console is great for someone like me who is on a budget and looking to dip your toes into some next-gen stuff. The quick resume features are great and load times are just phenomenal, GTA V is basically done loading in a minute in a half. The 120 Fps is also just awesome, it’s very fluid and for being the smallest Xbox ever I find it very impressive what’s it’s capable of. Now onto the problems, 1. No disc drive, now this doesn’t affect me much since I own my games digitally but I can definitely see why this would be a problem for others who have a whole collection of discs, 2. You only get 512 gigs of storage and I’m just gonna tell you that ain’t gonna last long especially games nowadays that can exceed 50 Gigabytes no problem. And if we’re being technical since your console has to download and install a bunch of updates that 512 is knocked down to about 390 something gigs. Before you buy this I recommend you either save up enough for a Memory Expansion Card made by Microsoft or buy an External hard drive for more storage.

I bought a cooling stand along with it and after seeing what this thing is capable of I realized that the cooling function is pretty much useless. I ended up keeping the stand for the charging ports. But back to the Xbox, the system I received is phenomenal. It came to me in perfect condition and it works like a charm. As for the consoles performance, probably the best of the newer models, it’s perfectly portable, the all digital setup ensures that you don’t need to worry about the clutter of taking game discs with you. The fact that the only form of storage on it is only solid state, it guarantees that you can keep the games you buy saved to the cloud and also allows for extremely fast loading times. Although the storage isn’t as much as advertised, since I thought it came with the full 512GB but instead I had around 318GB because of all the other apps it had already installed. But that would only be a hassle if you aren’t like me and have a ton of different games you want to play that are very big, or you’re a content creator or the sort. But regardless of that one minute flaw, it’s still a powerful system that runs high demanding games amazingly.

942,Xbox Series S,This is legit. And I’m pumped! ᕦ(ò_óˇ)ᕤ,"Came in a day early and delivered in original and unopened packaging. Everything was in the box. When you get it I recommend downloading the Xbox App before starting it up because on set up it will ask if you want to use the app and the only problem that I had is that if you take too long between steps it will ask you to re-enter the code. When I say to long I don’t mean the time it gives you. I mean if you pause for a minute or two between steps it might completely forget that you entered the code from the app. You can choose to continue without it but thought it was a cool user experience to control my Xbox with my iPhone. Also know that I downloaded about 5/6 games before the storage wasn't enough so get an internal drive too depending on what you’re getting. The games were Rocket League, Forza Horizon 4, COD War Zone, and Assassins Creed Odyssey Origins and Valhalla and it ran out of space on Valhalla. Hope this was helpful. I know I was worried I’d get scalper scammed. It’s just about as thick as a standard trading card so if you can fit a “Pokémon” or “Magic: The Gathering” card in a space you can probably fit this XBOX. It fits into the laptop pocket of my backpack so very easy packing too.

943,Xbox Series S,Awesome,"Exactly what I was wanting. Many want the series X and that is great for them. However the series s works better for me as I built a gaming PC in September of 2020. I waited until now to get the series s because I have no psychical media and no need for it. It plays games how I want. When I want and in good clarity. Sure you don't get ""true 4k"" gaming but that's fine by me. It works for what I need it for. Gamepass, Netflix, discovery plus. That simple. The 360gb you get does suck but again how many games can you actually play at a time....Any game that is not optimized for series x/s is played off my external D30.You won't regret buying one.

945,Xbox Series S,Powerful machine,My last new game system was a Wii. But after much prodding by old friends I decided to upgrade for multiplayer hi-jinx. I was planning to get the X but when I realized tracking one down would be next to impossible I decided to pull the trigger on the S. I am glad I did. It does everything I want/need. I did quickly realize that I had to add the expansion. And some rechargeable batteries. And of course an Xbox headset. So it does add up and the X is still probably the better value overall.

I ordered it from Amazon Warehouse on 12/15/21 and received it on 12/20/21.

953,Xbox Series S,A great buy so far,"The Xbox series S model so far as been a great buy. I was amazed at how small for the specs it carries. I know its not as fast at the X model. I didn't need the 4K tv specs. What some people don't know is that if you don't have an HDMI port with HDMI 2.1 settings you can't really get 4K 120hz anyway. The X model is only meant to be used with newer 4K tvs with the latest specs. I have a 4K tv but not the 2.1 HDMI port only 2.0. It still looks great on a 1080p TV though as well. I did test that. This model can handle up to 1440P at 120Ghz if I'm not mistaken. It only has 512GB solid state drive storage. I bought the 1TB expansion port card by Seagate.  Its pricey (i say what till Microsoft goes down on price on the expansion cards) It still has enough main storage to handle a few games. The thing I love about Xbox is the amount of games there are. Xbox has Xbox original, Xbox 360, Xbox one and Xbox S/X games. Please note this system is all digital (no discs). This didn't bother me. I play most of my discs digitally anyways.

955,Xbox Series S,Next gen?,Well my Xbox one x stopped working so I needed a quick replacement wanted the series x but didn't want to give scalpers my money. The series s is small and has quick loading time and for $299 capable of producing the level of graphics is impressive but I wouldn't call it next gen. I think the Xbox one x is better because of the of 4k gaming and going from a one x to series s feels like a downgrade. I'm just thankful for being able to purchase it for retail price on Amazon instead of paying $500 for it.

958,Xbox Series S,Great Step Into The New Gen of Consoles (Series S),"Loads games at stupid fast speeds, far faster than any last gen system could even come close to, this includes transitioning through menus and apps. Console is slim and compact, vents heat well and is near silent even when it's rendering heavy performance games. The only compliant I have is the storage size, it states 512gb but due to updates and system firmware it needs the system comes out to 364gb of usable space left. More and more modern games are edging up with the 60+ gb size catagories, this effectively limits the amount of games you can have installed vastly compared to series X.The system storage info can infact be remedied! With the additional purchase of the Seagate storage expansion card, which is unfortunately around $200 itself on top of a console that costs $300-$400 ( depending on who, what, when, and where you buy it) which in total brings itself up to the price of a series X of around $500.Overall I am happy with my purchase as it suits my needs perfectly and may even exceed them.

965,Xbox Series S,The Bridge Between Last-Gen and New-Gen Consoles,After playing on my Xbox Series S for a month now I can say I am happy with this little beast console ! This console can play new Xbox One and old Xbox 360 games if it's backwards compatible. The fast load times are amazing on current Xbox games and the increase frame rates are also very much welcomed. I redownloaded alot of past games just to try out how it stacks against my old Xbox One X there just no comparison to how stable it is plus most games are getting a X/S upgrade to take advantage of the new hardware. Then comes the downside to the Series S the internal hard drive only 346 GB is just way too small to build a library of games. You will constantly be deleting/reinstalling and good luck with updates. Sure you can fix this with buying a external hard drive but gotta sacrifice that fast load time or even the pricy $219 SSD just to maintain that fast load time for only 1 TB. If you can get past the small storage space then I would highly recommend you pick up a Xbox Series S to play your current games/older games at higher speeds or framerate but if your wanting bigger space and more graphical enhances of the new games coming down the line then get a Xbox Series X.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"July 13, 2021",abby,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGCRVAT5OCWRNXLVEKKIX5ZPRETA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True
966,Xbox Series S,"If you can make use of cloud gaming, this console might not be for you.","First, I've fully embraced cloud gaming and have no problem streaming games over the internet and I understand that this is not the case for everyone. Taking that into account, for me the Xbox Series S is of little use. Being all digital, the best thing to do is to subscribe to Game Pass of which Game Pass Ultimate is the best deal. With Ultimate, you get access to Xbox cloud gaming which you can use on your PC, on your phone, even on your Atari VCS if you have one. So the Series S is pretty useless without Game Pass but if you have Game Pass then you don't need the Series S. I know this sounds nuts but it's the dilemma I ran into after plugging my Series S in for the first time. If you don't care for or can't use cloud gaming then the Xbox Series S with Game Pass might be perfect for you, otherwise I would suggest making use of the cloud gaming service and don't worry about getting this console.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"October 8, 2022",David,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHRONJU4JRFOOL5LBCLMLVC3GMDQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

Comes with the console much smaller than the x box one much easier to store and fits very easily on a shelf or desk, a free HDMI chord, a power chord and a controller which feels much durable than previous x box box controllers. The console does have a cooling fan on top which makes for longer gameplay without overheating and the only downside to the console which isn’t really a downside if you hate going in public is the system doesn’t have a insert slot to put physical copies of your gaming disk. Overall a great gaming system with great performance at a lower cost.

1015,Xbox Series S,Best value of any gaming experience,"This console is obviously not the most powerful console but if you are looking at consoles in the first place I'm guessing it's because you prefer value over a top-of-the-line experience. The reasons this particular console is my favorite to emerge from this new generation:-Cost-The $300 price point is cheaper than any other current gen console and is affordable by most gamer's standards.-Value-I've done a bit of comparing and you would be hard pressed to build a gaming pc with identical specs for this price. Obviously, a pc with an operating system like Windows 10 has many more capabilities and functionality over the consoles but even the most budget of pc builds would be hard to accomplish at this price point.-Physical Build-I've seen multiple comparison pictures online but nothing beats getting your hands on one of these. It is the smallest console in the modern era and extremely well built. I also need to get my head about 4 inches from the exhaust fan before I can even hear it and I have excellent hearing.Conclusion: Unless you absolutely need the 4k gaming and/or the use of physical discs that the Series X provides, I think this one is a no-brainer.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"November 17, 2020",Cameron E.

1042,Xbox Series S,Read before buy,"I love this console, I do not regret in the least having bought it, the reason why I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I consider that it was advertised with false arguments.It was promised that there would be no difference with Series X beyond the resolution, however, some games do not have raytracing on this console, while the X does, such as Control and Doom Eternal.However, for its original price, it is impossible to get a video game device with a better performance/price ratio.Regarding storage, it is not worth spending on additional ssd storage, with an external hdd you can store new generation games, then when you want to play that games, just need to move them to internal storage.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"August 10, 2021",daniel,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEIO4SZ4VYDYULGKNW2DBUJF67RA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

1048,Xbox Series S,Storage kinda sucks but console runs great .,Over all pretty happy with it . It downloads and starts up much faster then my Xbox one x.

The only thing I don’t like is it’s not native 4K and not having a disk drive aren’t really super important but still would be nice . Major down fall is the storage or lack there of . You can have like 3 titles stored before taking up all your space . The aftermarket memory card will be a must if you plan to use this as your only console. I’m using my usb storage for now for my Xbox one games luckily I only own 3 games formatted for the series s .I will eventually make this console my back up / bedroom console snd upgrade to the series x.

But because of the price gouging and the fact that I was more likely able to find a new Series S at the $299 tag given at the right moment, I've decided to go for this instead. After owning it for over a month, it has worked well. The quick resume feature is one of the things I like about this console. The hardware design and the fact that it has less weight than my One S is another thing I like about it as well. Only downside is that there is no optical drive which I knew about already. So no more playing my disks. However, it was still worth getting it. I did buy a 4TB external hard drive since I know 512GB isn't going to be enough.

This console has achieved disappointing performance in many major major release. It seems incapable of producing native 1080p at 60fps, let alone 1440p at 60fps. It has terrible storage and memory, so essentially I can only play a handful of games at a time, and they all suffer from poor textures or pop-in. Budget console or not, the concessions required to reach 60fps are mounting and frustrating. First party developers even seem incapable of making this console not seem destined to be discarded sooner rather than later.

1188,Xbox Series S,NOT what was promised.,"With load times not much better than the original PS4, it's very hard to recommend this system for anyone interested in competitive gaming, or even those wanting a smooth casual gaming experience. Do not buy if you are expecting this to run anything in 120fps. Even with a high quality monitor/TV, this system will disappoint you with the realization that it only runs very specific games at 120fps as a maximum. This means even in the games optimized specifically for this system, you will usually be in the 60-70fps range. Where they get away with the scam is claiming the system can run UP to 120fps, but good luck getting that frame count on anything other than the dashboard. Also, if you're interested in gaming with a mouse and keyboard, this system is not for you, as even fewer titles than are optimized for the system, actually support mouse and keyboard. The games that do support mouse and keyboard however usually do not have any keybinding options, and mouse acceleration is enabled by default on most supported titles with no way to disable it. By far the biggest disappointment from this system is the fact that it's picture quality is worse than a release PS4 console, in attempts to improve responsiveness, which horrible fail. Do yourself a favor, don't fall for the marketing scams. If you need a console, put the money towards a series X, or PS5. You could also have a much better experience by spending this much on PC with outdated hardware. The only redeeming quality (and what you're actually spending $300 on) is the NVMe SSD, which delivers very slightly noticeable improvements in loading times over last gen consoles.The claims of this system are most definitely scams, and Xbox has a history of promising and not delivering, but the have outdone themselves in this regard with the Xbox Series S.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"April 16, 2022",Jimmy,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHNMLPI4C43AY2F3FIYFHPZIUODQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

1320,Xbox Series S,Broke in a day,"I live in Costa Rica.The story began with a black screen after the initial code imput on my smartphone.After a reeset, the set up was done from the xbox and not the app.Worked ""alright"" while downloading the regular qpps. Downladed Hollow N and slept since it was late.Next day, the console has several glitches while starting and it's showin lots of error codes, something went wrong from our side etc... at some restarts it wont log to my account, on others it logged and then froze... basic apps like ""settings"", ""storage"" took around 30 seconds to open. Device was very hot all the time and there was a never ending Microsoft store update in the background. Got a another black screen (1 more from many) and this time the xbox was no more.Troubleshoot menu did not show up with the ON and pairing button as Microsoft says. It appeared by itself, but after 15 minutes ""left alone"" while trying to start"". Manual usb update stays in ""preparing the console"" and never moves from 0%. Then displays  an error. Restore options would not accept the final imput from the controller to accept and begin.I contacted Microsoft and they offered the 1 year warranty But, they said Xbox is not available in my country so I have to psychically put the Xbox in the USA, then send it to Microsoft, they repair it or replace it, send it back to the US address and then I have to see how to ship it back to my country. They also added that since it's a full year warranty, perhaps on a possible future vacstion trip. I asked if they have an authorized company or repair shop that could work on it here and they said no. That Xbox is not available in my area.Luckily amazon accepted the return via a DHL pick up at my house (in Costa Rica), free of charge.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"September 27, 2021",Ruben,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH55USQMBMNNVNCGJRJRPCAP4WNQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

1621,Xbox Series S,Mutiple issues. Wait out the demand for quality.,"The packaging was low grade. Seemed as if the seller did not care about the item. Little packaging protection was used, meaning little amounts of bubble wrap, while the size of the box allowed for abuse if the product was mis treated by those not knowing what was inside.My controller's A button also got stuck many times after what seemed like 3 presses. The console also ran very hot. To the touch, it was by far the hottest I've ever felt any console perform at. It seemed like it was made by a company whom did not care about quality. I will be waiting out the rush of everyone buying systems due to the above issues.

1747,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,"Has flaws, but overall its a pretty solid system","This review is targeted at newcomers so for veterans of Nintendo products, not much new information here! As for everyone else looking at this gaming system wondering if its right for them, I'll do my best to explain what this model in particular brings to the table. In my particular case a: ""Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy‑Con - HAC-001(-01)""Introduction to the system/What is a Nintendo Switch?:The Nintendo Switch is a ""hybrid system"". Lets break it down to its core do understand what people mean by ""hybrid system"", lets start with what is basically a gaming tablet with a plastic screen and a multi-touch-touchscreen. This is the ""Switch itself"" so to speak. For a ""console"", it is EXTREMELY thin in comparison to a PS4 or Xbox One for example. This also means it takes significantly less energy to run. The internal cooling fan is also significantly quieter than either of the prior two other consoles mentioned.That multi-touch-touchscreen allows for certain mobile games like Muse Dash, VOEZ, Deemo, and many others to be ported to the Switch without compromising their touch screen gimmicks from their mobile phone counterparts. Despite this, many of them do have support for button controls. Many Switch games gives you options on how you want to play and this is a running theme with the Switch.Now for the controllers which are ""hybrid controllers"" in a way. For those of you who used the Nintendo Wii, these ""Joy Cons"" share and improved upon the motion controls from the Wii days, except in addition to the motion controls, Nintendo also made the actual button layout resemble a regular controller like the button layout found on a Xbox One controller for example. Not that weird button layout on the Wii for example. This means both the Wii crowd can assimilate into this new generation of Nintendo, along side the core gamers who would prefer a more ""traditional"" controller button set up.Normally a player would use both Joy Cons together as a pair, whether that be attached to the Switch Tablet itself to be played on the go like a 3DS (be it much longer than a 3DS), at home and connected to a plastic grip that gives you those controller ""thighs"" to make it easier to hold and to make it feel more like a more traditional controller even more. You can even use the Joy Cons without them being attached to anything like the Wiimote and Numchuck, but without that annoying wire in between your controllers. This ""detached"" controller style option with the Joy Cons allows you to play in positions otherwise impossible with a more ""static"" controller. For example, you can play with one arm behind your head while the other arm is resting on your stomach as you play from your bed or couch.These Joy Cons also have two buttons on the plastic rails that connect them to the Switch Tablet piece. These buttons are functional and you can actually use just a single Joy Con per player in certain supported games.Key word ""supported games"". This is where the main issue with the Nintendo Switch lies, Nintendo laid the foundation for developers to have the best tools at their deposal but not all of them use them. Some developers have games that cost less overall on the Switch than their original releases on other systems, or from mobile with mobile's atrocious micro-transactions , meanwhile there's other developers that neither have the full game on the physical game cartridges while having the audacity to be more expensive on the Switch. But again, its ALL developer based. Research the game developers in question to see if you're getting the best value for buying their ports (or original) releases on the Nintendo Switch.Oh right, this gaming system uses cartridges. Don't worry, they're not those huge ones from the Nintendo 64 days! They're more Nintendo 3DS sized if anything. If the developer you choose did it properly, a entire game can fit on these cartridges. This means you can play those properly done physical releases immediately without any additional downloads. But again, developer based. Some of them DO only ""partially"" have the game on the Switch Cartridge(s). Do your research.Now to talk about the Dock that connects the Switch Tablet to a TV.If you open up the back side of the Dock, there should be two slits near the bottom of the Dock. The Switch Tablet has two air vents that when ""docked"" should be right up against those vents. Please try not to block off those vents so the Switch Tablet as a easier time cooling itself off while you (and others) play in ""TV Mode"". The Switch Tablet also has a air-vent on the top. So keep that area of the Switch Tablet clear as well.This particular model of the Nintendo Switch, model number ""HAC-001(-01)"", is different from day one Nintendo Switch systems in the sense that Switches with the model number ""HAC-001(-01)"" have better battery life. For example, day one Switches would run really graphically/resource intensive games for about 2 hours 30 minutes (or 2.5 hours) minimum. Whereas this new ""HAC-001(-01)"" numbered Switch(es) can run those games for up to 4.5 hours minimum in ""handheld mode"". The way these ""new Switches"" accomplish this is by having a more efficient component in the inside of the Tablet piece. This also means these new Switches are more energy efficient and less prone to overheating than the day one models. So this is even helpful for people who would use this gaming system for TV use.If you don't have a Switch yet, I recommend this model for its versatility. You never know when you'll change your mind on ""how"" you want to play. I used to use it mostly in TV mode but eventually started using it more and more while outside in general. For example, on the bus, while waiting for something to start whether it be a class, jury duty, meeting, you name it. The Nintendo Switch will make that wait all the less painful. Waiting to be called or dismissed for jury duty especially.Oh, I almost forgot! You CAN use power banks with the Nintendo Switch! The minimum power requirements for a power bank to work with a Nintendo Switch is 5 Volts, and 2.4 Amps. The cable you use to plug the Switch Tablet with a power bank can be found bundled with the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller, or the Nintendo Switch Charging Grip. Both of those products come with the USB cable required to use a Nintendo Switch with a power bank. So even if you manage to drain this new Switch's battery life on a long trip, bring a battery bank and you can extend its battery life even further. But again, this mostly won't be needed unless you're on a air ride for over 7 hours or so. Anything less than that, if you're smart about it, you can get away with just the Switch's battery life.Speaking of battery life, the Joy Cons each have a estimated battery life of 20 hours each. Let me repeat that, 20 hours. That brings its competition's controllers to shame!So if you keep your Joy Cons charged overnight (they charge when connected to the Switch Tablet while the Tablet is charging in either the Dock or via battery bank), they ain't going to die unless you deliberately go out of your way not to charge them at least once a week.When their batteries are completely dead, both the Switch Tablet and one pair of Joy Cons takes about 3 hours to fully charge everything. So if you're able to, put the Switch Tablet with the pair of Joy Cons connected to it, and leave the three of them in the Dock overnight to keep everything nice and charged for tomorrows challenges.Get creative, once you get used to the options the Nintendo Switch offers, going to anything else, you'll realize that you'd taken for granted with the Nintendo Switch! In my particular case, using the two Joy Cons in each hand unconnected. I can't do that with a keyboard and mouse! So get your Joy Cons, get them in a position that works for you, get cozy on your couch, bed, etc. and have some fun with your game(s) of choice!Just keep in mind it is a GAMING SYSTEM FIRST, and the ""entertainment media center"" SECOND. So as of January 15th, 2020 don't expect things like Netflix to be on this machine. If you treat it as a DEDICATED gaming system, you're in for one hell of a ride!Just don't forget your screen protector since the Switch Tablet's screen is made of plastic!If you don't want to go through all of them, get this one:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XDWBPMZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1It should serve most peoples' needs. Its durable, cheap, anti-glare, self heals from minor scratches, etc. Its the most value for the price I've found from searching through all of what Amazon has as far as Switch Tablet screen protectors go.As far as the ""system itself"" goes, this is pretty much all of the information that you'd need. Everything else is developer centered, game wise. Do your research, and think very carefully which developers will give you the best bang for your buck!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"January 16, 2020",Spearra,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFHK67RLQRZS7XS6NAQG6ALYCQPA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True
1748,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,Really lives up to the hype.,"I couldn't afford to purchase this video game system for a good few years since money was tight while I was attending college. But, after saving up over the course of a few months, I became the proud owner of a Nintendo Switch system last year. And I gotta say... it really lives up to the hype.Being able to switch (no pun intended) between gaming on the TV and gaming in portable handheld mode has been a very nice, convenient gaming experience indeed. For example, it lets me take the game with me if I suddenly need to head into town with my family and I don't want to wait until I come back from town to continue my game. The games run very well and it gets great internet reception too (most of the time).I'm not sure I've ever had this much fun playing video games since Pokémon Ultra Moon on the 3DS. I'm definitely glad I ordered this game system.

1749,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,"The switch is a unique console that has a lot of good ideas, but is poorly executed.","I have an loaded opinion on this console that I want to express. The Switch is flawed. As an avid gamer who usually ends up buying all the consoles (except the xbox one) and loves the hardware behind these machines, the switch was super cool when I first heard about it and saw it. I got one not to long after release once they came back to my area. Though it took awhile to save up for any games as during that point in its life, everything was expensive on it and 3rd party devs hadn't moved to it yet. Also there were no media apps on it besides hulu which somehow is still a thing, surprising. But that isn't what I want to talk about, its more how the switch feels really damn cheap.I don't mean cheap as with the plastic shell either (but that is an issue, dislike the texture a lot, and it was also damaged by strong adhesives from dbrand before), but you get a wimpy TN panel for its main built in display, in an era where amoled and ips are very obtainable for device of this size (the original psvita was oled, so it could have been possible). As the resolution is at a solid 720p, which can help balance good enough quality on the go with actual game performance, I feel like they should have opted for a nicer quality screen to have better range of colors, would have created more vivid scenes using sharper and brighter colors. Instead they chose washed out TN panels which leave a lot to be desired when comparing it to any handheld screen semi modern hand held screen with exception of DS's which also chose awful screens. (and some might argue TN for faster response time, and to that, I highly disagree with improvements to other display types, and also for the type of audience the switch aims at)Next I want to talk about the Joycons, as they are lovely little controllers that snap onto the side of the console with a satisfying click. I actually wouldn't have minded them despite being kinda awful when using them on a big screen if they worked correctly, but three years in and these things are still built to fail. There is a major design flaw in them that eventually has the analogue stick wear our and start ""drifting"", making the controller effectively useless. If these were cheap, maybe I wouldn't care as much, but they are 80$ to replace. Sure you can contact nintendo customer support and they sometimes take care of you, but this is a hassle and shouldn't even be a problem. They could have just owned up to the mistake, and redesigned the controllers at this point. ( pro controller is actually a solid design, but its more expensive then both ps4 and xbox one controllers so I dislike recommending it. I believe its the amiibo sensor that does this and that's just bad).Lastly, I kinda wanna just complain about nintendo being nintendo. But before that I want to praise them for how far they did come up to this point. There is finally 3rd party content being pushed on the Switch and thats awesome. It seems like they did listen a bit and made it much easier to get games on the Switch. Ok now onto the bad. The Switch has no utility, and I get that its a gaming console, but still its surprsing that the most mobile and potentially flexible console lacks basic OS features that things like the ps4, psvita, and even 3DS were capable of doing such as, have a variety of streaming services, a basic web browser, and customizing the layout of your home screen/having fun backgrounds. There is no personality to the switch despite it being one of the most unique consoles I have ever seen, which is quite baffling to me. Despite the console featuring bluetooth for its joycons and pro controller, you cant connect bluetooth headphones to it without a 3rd party adapter, which is a little baffling for an on the go console. The UI looks pretty ugly when put onto a big screen, just a personal gripe of mine, I really don't like it. Lastly, the game cartridges are a letdown. The reason games usually feel more expensive on the switch is because they more often then not are. This is due to the game cartridges costing more to make than blu-ray media for the other consoles. Nintendo also didn't want a disparity of cost between physical media and digital media, so if you launch a game both ways, you need to have the price be the same, which creates higher costing digital games on the switch store vs any other platform. The cost of the cartridge also varies depending on size of the game, so larger games will suffer more to this than smaller ones.That's my loaded opinion which turned more into a typed rant on the switch. Its still a pretty ok console that provides a ton of unique experiences that you can't get on any other platform. As a sole console I don't think I would recommend this unless you fully know what you are getting into, but as a side device to play exclusives its not bad. Hopefully they will release new hardware and software updates to fix many of the gripes I rambled on about.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"July 31, 2020",Terrorgod,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEN5PWWOWHGAMH4B6UZFSAZNMOCA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

1769,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,"Great Console, however not without flaws","After Switch's became almost non-existent at the beginning of March 2020, it is good to see they are finally back on the market. I pre-ordered my switch off amazon in January. It was supposed to arrive in March, but to my surprise and delight, it arrived a whole month early. I've been having a blast so far, but like everything, there are pros and cons to this device.I've seen some complaints from people about buying the switch on amazon. When buying it, make sure that it cost 299. If the switch alone costs more than that, you are buying from scalpers. Avoid buying switch bundles. They might seem like a good idea but they often jack up the price to get an insane profit, because you don't actually know how much it costs to make all the various extra add-ons they are supplying. Lastly, make sure it says that the seller of your switch is Amazon.com. If it comes from anyone else, you might be scammed/sold a switch that is supposed to be new but is not.PROS:- Great for people who miss the days of mobile gaming. And when I say mobile I don't mean phone games, I mean PS  Vita's, DS, etc. The switch gives you the best of both. Sometimes I plug it into the tv big screen and enjoy the beauty of it, but having the option to play in my room or in a car is or literally anywhere is a big plus for those who want to.- The Price. While in comparison to other consoles the switch is not the best in terms of technology (it's not even close), it is the cheapest. It cost 299 prior to taxes/duty. A digital PS5 is going to cost at least 399, and an Xbox is 499.- The games. While at launch it might have been a bit sparse, not anymore! There are tons of games available to play, from Nintendo classics to indie games.- Perfect for casual/busy players. If you're like me, and can't devote your whole life to gaming, the switch is the perfect device. Its cheaper price-tag and mobility make it perfect for gaming for one or two hours a day, without breaking the bank.CONS:- Joycon drift. If you buy a switch, expect your joycons to eventually stop working correctly. It hasn't happened to me yet (thankfully), but it will happen. To everyone eventually. For some reason, Nintendo won't fix this. My best bet is they know people get annoyed and just buy new ones instead of waiting for them to sort it out/replace it for free. Be prepared to fork out 80 USD if yours break.- The ""Nintendo Tax"". Expect Nintendo games to cost way more than their counterparts. Mario Cart 8, which came out on the Wii U, is still 60 dollars. Old Nintendo games that came out years ago are still selling for full price. Why? Because Nintendo knows you bought the switch just to play these games. Also, the fact that you can still buy these games on game cartridges pushes up the price.- The dock. The dock is, well, not as advanced as you might expect. It is an electrical part surrounded by a piece of plastic. I highly recommend buying a dock sleeve or a screen protector before using the dock. There have been reports of the dock scratching/ damaging screens because of the plastic scratching against the surface.- Lastly, the storage. I bought 2 games to start, Animal crossing and Mario cart. Half of my switch's internal storage is now gone. You are going to need to buy an SD card. You do need to be careful however, not all SD cards work with switches. So if you're like me and don't know how the technology works, you might just need to buy the branded SD card for switch, which is more expensive than a regular old sd card. If you are technologically advanced, I highly recommend doing some research to save moeny.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"February 10, 2021",Erin Phillips,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGUU7XVPF7ZQ6IDQAMRH25JVZZJQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

1779,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,Take it anywhere,"I used to play Nintendo 64 back in the day and now I have another Nintendo product that I love.I play my Switch every single day. Mostly Animal Crossing at the moment, but I change it up sometimes. The only thing is the price of the games. They have sales all the time for various games on the shop but a lot of the bigger name games aren't included those. Or if they are the ""sale"" is pretty negligible.The things I love the most about the Switch is that you can take it pretty much anywhere. To my friend's house when we hang out, on long car trips, outside, you name it. The other thing I love is how durable the system is. I have dropped it at least three times on hardwood floor and tile and it hasn't affected the performance at all.Great little game system.

1786,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,Nintendo's best console in a long time,"Sure, it's no PS4 or PS5, but it's an incredible little machine with such incredible versatility in such a tiny package. While it might not have the pure processing power and graphics capability of the other two major systems it does do what Nintendo has done best for a long time, provide a reasonably priced quality portable gaming system. The advantage this time is that the Switch is both a home console and a portable console in one unit. This is something that consoles in general have never really been able to do until now and it's amazing how great the game quality is even in this small form factor.I mean, the Wii was good in the motion control but the gimmick did wear after a bit. The WiiU really felt like a disappointment in that it just didn't bring much to the table and Nintendo clearly wasn't going to be able to compete in the home console market against the other two juggernauts. What Nintendo has always been great at though is dominating the portable gaming market and the switch sees them bringing their expertise in the portable market to the home console market in a power play that really paid off in my opinion.Now, this system does still suffer from some of Nintendo's generally less favorable business practices so do take that in to account. The price for the Switch itself actually isn't that unreasonable so I don't fault them for that whatsoever. The peripherals, on the other hand, really put a dent in the pocketbook if you need to buy anything that didn't come in the box (and you probably will need to at some point, let's be honest). The price of games also comes at a premium just as it has with past Nintendo systems as you will rarely see even older games every discounted or put on sale while such things are very common with the the competing systems. For instances, ""Zelda: Link's Awakening"", which has roughly 13 to 15 hours of content, will still cost you $60 which is incredibly high for a game that offers so little content with little replay value. Sadly Nintendo has a tendency of doing this and always has so do be prepared to pay premium prices for most games with the Switch.All in all I still think the unit is worth it particularly since you just can't find a better portable gaming platform than this. I definitely recommend getting the Switch over the Switch Lite as those are fully integrated and if you bust an analog stick or a button you're pretty much screwed. With a Switch you can replace the side controllers as you need and we all know controller buttons and analog sticks can wear over time so that alone is worth it. I mean, for $100 more you get a heck of a lot better of a system than you do with a lite so I highly recommend going this route if you're looking in to a Switch.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"March 7, 2021",Keonyn,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGOQW22ILHQGZ5IELCXX5KWSX32Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

1792,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,It’s pretty but not sturdy.,"This is my first switch console. So let me start off by saying the console itself is absolutely beautiful. The design on the back is so pretty and the joycons are gorgeous as well.My biggest issue is not the console itself. But the accessories for it. I’m sure you’ve seen the terrible reviews for the joycons themselves. If you haven’t please check them out. I had done my research on them before hand and ended up buying a different controller just because I was so nervous about using the joycons. The idea is awesome. But they feel so flimsy and cheap. I hadn’t planned to even use the ones that came with the console. I planned to put them away as collectors items. But of course I had to use them to start up the console. As I was holding them I felt the plastic on the back of the right joycon move and make a loud snap. I thought I broke it and I hadn’t even done anything. I was just setting up the console. The colors may look great. But after having that as my first experience I do believe all the reviews I’ve seen for them.The next thing that feels awful is the dock. I had planned to play with the console docked the majority of the time. But just putting the console in makes me cringe because no matter how gentle or slow you are it still hits the sides of the dock when attempt to dock it. There’s only two tiny pieces of soft rubber like material in the dock itself. Which doesn’t protect the console enough. So I ended up buying a screen protector immediately just to give some protection from the dock itself. Just pushing the power button makes the console move and jiggle around in the dock, making it repeatedly hit hard plastic. It doesn’t feel secure whatsoever. The actual part that connects to the switch inside of the dock is very lose as well. The door on the back of the dock also feels cheap. Reminds me of the doors on the Wii. It feels like it could pop off rather easily.Let’s move on to the console a little bit. I have used the kickstand. It doesn’t feel super stable and I’d worry if I didn’t have it standing up on a very stable surface. I’d be nervous to have it anywhere near children or accident prone people like me while using it. The screen looks great though. But the hdmi quality of the console menu looks horrible on my monitor. Games seem to look great though, just not the menu/home/settings etc. So I’m not sure if there’s a way to fix that or not. I play other consoles on my monitor and they look beautiful. Another thing, while holding the console with the joycons attached it feels huge. Too big, awkward, and heavy for my tiny hands and I wasn’t even holding it that long. So if you are thinking about getting the switch to playing more mobile and you have tiny hands, maybe consider a switch lite? Unless you want docking and kick stand capabilities which isn’t something the lite can do.The console works great. It’s fast and easy to use and navigate. The buttons feel sturdy as well. I’ve been playing Animal Crossing for hours while docked and the console never gets hot. Just a little warm.Overall this console was a cool idea. Just wish they would have put a little more time and money into making some parts a little more sturdy.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"March 20, 2020",Sydney W.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEVKMKUVATN4CZOAJUHEAHG4W4GQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True
1793,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,Love the Switch - A Casual Gamer's Best Console,"This is my review of the 'V2' (2019) version of the Nintendo Switch (model #HAC-001(-01)).So a little background, I was a enthusiastic PC gamer in college who built my own PCs for the purpose and am now - due to the demands of adulthood - someone who only plays the occasional game. My last handheld Nintendo console was the black and white Game Boy Pocket in the early 90's, so I've been away from the platform ---- a while.I bought the Switch purely because I learned they had ported Skyrim to it, and as a huge fan of the Elder Scrolls genre I was hoping to devote some of my train commute to questing around Tamriel. In this sense, the Switch does not disappoint. I am not a graphics connoisseur, but - compared to the PC version - Skryim plays really well on the Switch. No perceptible lag, colors are crisp. Yes, it's missing the expansions and yes, the text can be a little small, but that's a fair trade-off for the portability this platform brings.So far, I only own 2 games - Skyrim and MarioKart 8 (another throwback to my college dorm days on the N64), and I love playing both on the Switch, MaroKart is obviously the newer game and so the graphics and gameplay are much better but I'm a still a sucker for Skyrim (at least until the next ES is released, hopefully in my lifetime).Anyway, all this to say the Nintendo Switch is a great console for busy adults who want to reminisce about the fun they had 10, 20, or even 30 years ago. The Switch doesn't take itself too seriously (which I love) but that means it might not be the right choice for people concerned with the perfect graphic or gameplay experience - there are dedicated consoles that do this much better. What the Switch does is make gaming on the go effortless, fun for the average busy person and something you can really enjoy with your whole family - which I think was Nintendo's real goal here all along.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"September 6, 2019",Sherlockian,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHVVC3WLMDJRWMMZ2Z2TDJ2PQDCQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

I thought the controller would be a little awkward to play with, but it's easy to get the hang of. The only thing I can say is that it's not as ergonomic as an Xbox or even a PS controller, so if you're playing for long stretches of time, your hand will cramp up.I think that the biggest plus for me is how small this thing is - the entire console isn't much bigger than smartphones nowadays, and the games for it are half the size of DVDs. If you're fine with the limited game lineup and just want a console to kill time now and again, this is a great option.

(He's 4) He is really thrilled that he can take it room to room and place it on any switch dock we have in that room and instantly start playing on the TV (We have 2 switches). As a 4 year old being able to do that without help from adults gives him the feeling of being independent for him I'm sure. Since getting his device we have bought multiple accessories for it including a case, screen protector (of course!), SD card and a Nintendo switch pro controller all working flawlessly with the switch. Nintendo really made a genius product not only for adults but for littler kids too as my 4 year old can run his system all without help from me which is quite a big deal not having to help someone 24/7.

1819,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,(New) Nintendo Switch HAC-001(-01),"This revised model of the Switch comes with a number of features that I honestly can't fully appreciate as someone who didn't own the previous model. The big thing that drew me in was the extended battery life, even though so far I haven't played much in handheld mode and not at all in tabletop, but they use the same amount of battery either way I would imagine. The reason I'm giving this system five stars probably say more about how good it is than anything else. But I pretty much expected as much. I'm sure by now you can go online and find more detailed reviews for the gaming system, but in case you're wondering here, this one comes with the system, two gray joycons, two attachments to turn each joycon into its own controller, a base to connect both joycons into the formation of a singular controller, the required cables, and the Switch dock. So you'll probably want to buy a few things alongside this such as an SD card for reasonable storage space, a pro controller for a more standard controller experience, maybe a dock sleeve to prevent the possibility of scratching the screen from insertion and ejection of the system, an online pass if you plan to play any games with online features... just basically a lot of things that would be nice if they came with the system itself. This will inflate the price further, but the thing here is that this is going to replace the old models of the Switch and simply make this the main one manufactured now. So... basically, if you want a cheaper Switch you'll want to get a Switch Lite and this one will still cost about 300 bucks like the 2.5+ year-old original variant still costs. That is, unless you want to go used. I'm only bringing up these points because while this is a great system, I do think you should be aware of what is likely to happen with prices and availability going forward and plan accordingly. Once I realize a Switch was still going to cost the same if I wanted the ability to do on and off TV play I decided I might as well just hop on board with this newer variant. I'd recommend you do the same as it has had tweaks to make it just a slightly better version all around than the previous model. Otherwise, if price is a concern, wait for the Switch Lite and see how it tickles your fancy. Also, here's tip. If you want to turn the system off as opposed to leaving it in sleep mode, simply hold down the power button on the system for a few seconds and then a menu will appear with the option to restart or shut down. Also note that you cannot play on the TV off of the Switch's battery power. The dock needs to be plugged in for the dock to function. I hope something in here was helpful.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"September 15, 2019",Sam Lilly,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFCUXKZ2RIFJPRAQ6LTDNOVNE7OQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

People might say that it's not great and it's very small and does not process as well as the New Xbox X or the PS5. But it's not supposed to be like that. It's meant for the Nintendo games. You can't play any Mario game or Pokemon game without the switch. Every other console is can't compare. There's a reason why it was never in the console wars.

1831,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,"Best battery life, largest screen and HD rumble make this a better buy than the Lite version.","I don’t use this the way that Nintendo advertises; predominantly hand held.  I have the Skull & Company Grip Case attached at all times and only play in handheld mode.  The Switch Lite is too small and doesn’t have the HD rumble like this one has.  This model is the better one with the longest battery life currently available.  This is not designed with comfort in mind for handheld play sessions so the Lite may be a better option if comfort is important.  If you get hand cramps like I do, I highly recommend the Skull & Company grip case.  They also have a great travel case that you can get with it that has plenty of space for the switch with case and joycons attached and space for games, a power adapter and power bank.  It is very good quality and the Switch is dockable with the grip case attached.The switch itself has a much faster, more user friendly, prettier, less congested graphics user interface than all of Nintendo’s previous consoles.  It has a solid state drive for saving and downloading some games, and is expandable with the purchase of Micro SD cards for additional space.  The online store is easy to use and probably the best Nintendo has ever had.  Easy to sort by price, genre, developer.  It is fast and easy to use and you can sort for free games and demos too.  The load time between starting games and between cut scenes in game is very quick on hard drive, sd card, and game cartridge.  Much quicker than nintendo’s previous consoles.  I haven’t played with the joy cons detached so I can’t comment on how responsive the joycons are to movement and player interaction when joycons are detached.  The HD rumble is more subtle than on PS4 and XBox but some games have used it very well.  Mario Odyssey for example has done a great job of blending the environments in some levels to match well with the rumble feedback; its hard to explain, but this feels like the next step in controller evolution and PS5 and NextBox will be adopting a similar tech so more developers should get on board with HD Rumble in future games, hopefully.  The switch buttons have a nice click and feel like they will last, much like most of Nintendo’s products but the stick feels a little looser than the PS4.  I would like Nintendo to tighten that up for the Pro version.  Overall, this is decades of Nintendo engineering in the making which has resulted in, arguably their best console to date.  It is going to shatter console sales records for good reason.  I highly recommend this version of the Switch for the battery life, larger screen and hd rumble, but you may want to get a comfort grip if you will be using it predominantly as a handheld.  I no longer play on my 3DS because this is a much better player experience.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"December 7, 2019",Chrissy,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGZXOXB7YPUMKB64BVK74STH4Z3A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

1838,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,It has its pros & cons..but more pros!,"I bought the Switch a few months ago and now that I’ve spent some time with it (more than I’d like to admit ^_^) I wanted to leave a review.The Switch has many pros over other consoles, it’s main pro being that it’s a portable console with games that previously are only found on PC or console. I am a PC gamer and my PC is an absolute beast with an 8700K & 2080 Ti BUT the reason I bought a Switch is because oftentimes I am out and about and can’t bring my big honkin’ PC with me. Obviously I prefer my PC but it’s nice to be able to play games like Witcher 3 and then  when I have to go somewhere in the car or something I can seamlessly “Switch” to the Switch and continue my game.There are some absolutely AMAZING games on the Switch: Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Witcher 3, Splatoon, Super Smash Ultimate, etc., which are worth buying the Switch. This is especially true for people with kids as most of Nintendo’s big hits are kid friendly. You may not want your very young children to play violent games like Call of Duty or Battlefield 5 but they can definitely play a similar kind of game with Splatoon 2 only instead of shooting bullets to kill people they’re splattering paint all over each other.However the Switch also has its cons. Let’s start with Nintendo’s “E-Shop”. The E-shop sells games that are WAY overpriced. They charge $59.99 USD for games that have been out for years. The fact is you can buy physical copies of these games for less on Amazon AND you have the benefit of being able to resell the game later if you want too. Not so with digital games.Then there is the price. Yes the Switch is $299 which is cheaper than Microsoft and Sony’s consoles but when you factor in the cost of necessities that are almost required for optimal play (Pro Controller, SD card, Screen Protector) the cost adds up quickly.All in all though I do recommend the Nintendo Switch. It’s a great console for anyone who just wants to have a good time and it’s especially great for families or people with young kids who want to play games with them without worrying about violence, drug use, sexual situations, etc., that are in a lot of other games.5/5 Stars",5.0 out of 5 stars,"March 15, 2020",Blake,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEBORGHNCXOCGYEJ4WCULQCQWLAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

1853,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,Great for younger kids or mobile gaming.,"This is, strangely enough, the first portable system I have ever bought in my 30+ years of gaming. I’ve actually bought 2 Switches so far. The first one was a Christmas present for my son who I was trying to ease into video games. He loves it. After him having it for a year and me occasionally playing it to help him through areas where my greater experience with games could help get through certain areas, I was tempted to get one for myself to play when I had long periods of downtime at work. When Witcher 3 came out for the switch, I bought another one for me and have been playing it a few times per week since.My experience with the console is pretty much strictly in the handheld mode. I bought a Satisfye grip and case for my switch which allows me to hold the system more comfortably than I would without it. Holding the standard system and playing for more that 20 minutes or so causes my hands to cramp. The small joycons are just too small for adult male hands to use for long without some discomfort. I’m fine with that since the small size makes the system easier for kids, like my son, to use. A regular controller can be a bit bulky for a grade school age kid to use well. With the case and grip, this system is perfect for me to throw into my vehicle at work and forget about it until things slow down when I’m waiting for a call. Then I can break it out and pass the time in style.All in all, I have no complaints about the system, my son loves it and uses it constantly. I like it for its portable nature and surprising computing power. It is the first portable system I’ve experienced that didn’t feel like a downgrade or gimmick. The Switch instead feels like a true portable version of a larger console like PS4 or XB1. I still play on my PS4 far more than I do the Switch, but I can’t take that system to work and play in the office or car.

1863,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,A satisfying multi-use gaming device for the family,"The Nintendo Switch is a nearly perfect gaming device for family use. With our one-TV household our Xbox Series S spends more time streaming Netflix than gaming while the Nintendo Switch can entertain both on the big screen and away from it.Out of the box it took a bit of time to get gaming as you need a Nintendo account. Pokemon Quest was the simplest and quickest to get going with. We haven't yet tried any ""physical"" games meaning we've only tried games you download (which the Xbox Series S/X excels at.)The multi-modality of the Nintendo Switch is great but be prepared to be disciplined with the various bits or you'll lose them. You'll also want to buy a screen protector and a carrying case. The build quality is pretty good but there is some flex when using it in mobile mode. The default brightness is underwhelming while the max brightness of the screen is only good enough if you are used to top-end mobile phones. The controller buttons are not backlit and have small print so for older parents like me you'll have to memorise what is X, A, B, Y etc.Nintendo Online is somewhat confusing and not quite what you get from Xbox Game Pass. Setting up kids profiles from the parent's Nintendo account is more complicated than it should be and creates blockers if you are away from WiFi. Nintendo, just let people play offline or online and sync it later.The games on offer are family friendly without being childish. You can relive Super Nintendo games with the Nintendo Online subscription. There are more games to create and explore than games to destroy and kill. The free-to-play games include some usual suspects but the list is quite short. There is no Roblox on the Nintendo Switch, yet, and you'll have to buy Minecraft, again.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"July 19, 2021",Paul Watson,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFVPFE37DD3JLF5U2VP24PQXZTFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True
1864,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,Worth it if you want it,"The ability to swap from dock to handheld still amazes me to this day. The library of games is crazy good, The battery life isn't bad, and the build is fairly durable. The screen is prone to scratching due to it being plastic, but a $10 screen protector fixes that easily. The controllers do go bad over time. I would recommend also purchasing a pro controller due to it having a better feel for me personally and they last far longer than any Joycon I've had. This purchase date was for my sister but I've had mine since near release and have gone through 3 pairs of Joycon, meanwhile my oldest pro controller (between 4 or 5 years) of the 3 I currently have has only shown slight signs of degradation. There is a ""Nintendo tax"" on some games which basically means they cost more than they would on other consoles (e.g. Borderlands collection I got on pc for like $20 where as the switch is charging $50 for games released between 2009-2014 so that you can play them on graphically worse hardware, but the portable part may be worth it for some people with certain games). The online services are really bad a lot of the time especially when playing with people who are far away or have otherwise unstable connections. Playing with random people online can be a very painstaking process a lot of the time. With all this being said, I love this console. It is the only console I use (I also have a pc and a ps4). I only look at it so critically due to how much I love it. If I didn't spend hours and hours using this thing I wouldn't be telling you all it's flaws in a 4-star review. It can be frustrating sometimes, but the exclusives are amazing (there are also a lot of great 3rd party games but I mainly mean that BOTW is a masterpiece and Mario Odyssey is phenomenal) and the ""home console and handheld"" idea is honestly incredible. I basically wrote an essay about this thing to tell you how much I love it.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"May 12, 2021",Elijah Maciejewski,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEWIKCTMBJ7YIQNZMGPR7N7RJQFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

System is sleek and easy to set up, making it a very stress-free situation.  Everything is well documented so that you can have the easiest time setting up your console.

1867,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,Best Handheld System Today,"Okay, so, initially I thought the Switch was a bit overhyped mainly because of the price. However, now that it has dropped I find it to be a fantastic investment- especially for casual gamers. It's so nice to just curl up on my couch and enjoy my favorite games.The experience of mashing buttons really reminds me of the DS and Game Boy days, but the fact it has a touch screen as well makes some things more convenient depending on the game. The Switch can give you multiple experiences considering it's joycons can come off and attach to a controller like the more modern gaming systems. You can play from your Switch's screen, or hook it up to your TV.I find the quality of the screen to be really good as well. Obviously it's not juiced up like a PC setup, but considering the amount of power and versatility that is contained in one small device it is IMPRESSIVE.The main downside to the Switch is the pricing of some of it's games, as I see no reason the mobile version of most games should be priced like PC games. However, many of these pricey games also have a lot of effort put into them so it is understandable. If you're like me and casually game normally buying games when they're on sale, this isn't much of an issue.My overall experience is amazing and I plan on getting many games for my Switch.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"September 26, 2021",Starry,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGTQUV4XBMHINA7PMOTFSUBJ5SSQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

1870,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,"Bit of a rocky start but good for now!  Wish it was as sturdy as my old PS2,  now that is a beast...","I bought this system for myself as a birthday present, and I have enjoyed using it!  The controllers took a bit getting used to detaching on and off properly.  I think the main thing is to be careful about what games you buy if the device will be worth it to you in the end, or if you are excited about upcoming games.  I waited to purchase the Switch until I knew there were about ten games I wanted to play and added about three of them into the in initial cost as well.  I’m pretty picky about my games because I am a casual gamer. Zelda breath of the wild—which I borrowed from my brother later— is more intensive than anything I have played in YEARS.Games are expensive in physical format, although that is my preference.  There are some cheaper games on the online store.  So far my favorite local game shop does not have any used copies of Switch games although they have everything else.  Maybe some day.I might buy a screen protector for it in the future but have not as of yet.  If your Switch is to see heavy use by an entire family or if as an owner you plan to travel with it I’d recommend one but that is not the case for me. I did have a problem within a month of ordering the machine where the fan started whirring LOUDLY.  At first only when it was plugged in to charge then all the time when it was at rest, then at last even while playing a game.  I called Nintendo customer service and had it repaired (although I had to send it back three times with the same issue to a radioshack in Syracuse NY.  Last time I sent it in they just replaced the system.)If I have a problem in the future I will request replacement rather than repair, especially if it’s going back to New York.  Just not happening.  At least customer service was good, but I was becoming a bit disgruntled toward the end there with their techs!  For my troubles customer service gave me a new set of controllers automatically and then later, three months free on the eshop.

1873,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,Buy it for the exclusives or don't buy it at all.,"If you look at Nintendo's list of exclusive games and think, ""Yeah, I'm all about that"", dive in. This is a fun console that offers play on your TV screen or handheld (switch... duh). With multiple controller configuration options including extra peripherals that will make your controller become a steering wheel, a golf club, a fishing pole, and a fitness ring just to name a few, there is a lot of fun and creativity built into Nintendo's latest console.Add to all of this, with a Nintendo Online subscription you get access to tons of free and low cost games. They have included a virtual NES and SNES console with a good selection of classic games. There are also other free games like Tetris 99 and the new Super Mario 35 which are loads of fun. There are also lots of other games that can be had for as little as $2.99If however you're looking for a console to play the latest cross platform hits, you're probably better off with a PC or one of the next gen gaming consoles. Playing a big cross platform game, you will notice a difference in graphics quality. The Switch only displays in HD, while every other console (and pc) is up to 4K now. Plus the Nintendo controllers, while fun and creative, will not hold up to long term play for something like a FPS. They are fun controllers, and work perfectly for the Nintendo games, but they feel like they would ultimately break after a few serious button mashing sessions. If you've seen all the drama about controller drift, you now know why.Bottom line is if you're all about Nintendo exclusives like Mario, Zelda, Animal Crossing, Metroid? (please?), get this console. It will provide a great deal of entertainment.

I wasn’t expecting to get it for about a month or so but it ended up coming 2 weeks early which was a nice surprise. I see a lot of bad reviews and they’re all mostly because of the price which I think isn’t really fair, saying you got price gouged but you’re the one that paid for it.. it’s not like you thought it’d be 300 and they changed the price to 400 after the fact. If you don’t wanna pay more then wait. I wanted to get this but Amazon was out of stock so I waited a couple days or so n it was back in stock and regular price. Anyway, good price good product.. works just like it said it would.

1897,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,Be Patient!,"I got this Gray version of the Nintendo Switch after a few months of hunting for retail price $299. There's a couple of websites out there that will notify you of in-stock. I happened to be able to grab it off of Amazon, but GameStop, Target, Walmart, Best Buy, etc, also have them as well. With it being in stock is rare, so you just have to look and be patient! Plan a few months ahead for birthday / xmas gifts so you have time to wait for a retail priced stock is in. Enough about the INSANE price gouging....I am very pleased with the Switch and am very happy with it. I have played on it for a week so far and everything is working fine and dandy, as it should. One gripe is that the storage capacity is small so only a few games can be played at a time, but with a micro SD card, possibilities are endless. I ordered one of those, and expect it soon so I can expand my downloaded game collection. I've enjoyed the Switch so much I'm getting some additional joycons and a grip and a charging station. I'm going to continue looking for accessories. Maybe a case I also had to get a TV adapter because my old TV only has one HDMI port, so I had to RCA to HDMI it up in order to not unplug and replug my Roku every time I want a bigger screen. How that goes is yet to be determined.I'm still figuring out how the dock station works (TV debacle), but for the most part - no complaints!

1899,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,Situation Better than You May Think,"First of all, I wanna say that although Amazon may have some date when they say it will be in stock or some date when they say it’ll be delivered, just know that it may be earlier than anticipated. I ordered mine thinking it wasn’t gonna be here until  around June 4th, so about 3 weeks to a month after I ordered the switch, but fortunately, it came 2 weeks earlier! Apparently, I’m far from the only one who has experienced this, and a number of people have gotten their switch earlier than expected, so don’t look at the date thinking that’s when you’re gonna get it, ‘cause you may just get a nice surprise like a number of customers did. Yes, there are some stock issues with the switch at the moment as well as some production issues, but they are not as bad as they’re made out to be, so if you are thinking about getting the switch, go ahead and pull the trigger! Also, DO NOT BUY FRON SCALPERS. As some other people have mentioned, they will buy a switch and then sell it for a greater price than needed in order to make a profit, and although it may be tempting to buy from them so you can get it sooner, it is so not worth paying the extra money when the situation is actually better than amazon makes it out to be. Don’t do yourself a disservice and fall into the instant gratification trap. Be willing to wait a little bit longer for your switch.

1907,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,Great overall system for gaming with friends!,"Similar to other Nintendo systems, innovation is always attached to their new ideas. The joy cons are similar to the wii remotes, albeit not as precise for some games where they were used for shooting type games, the joy cons are incredible for multiplayer. I honestly prefer using one joycon whenever I can when playing games, it's really nifty being able to play two player automatically with a friend or family member without having to pay for an expensive controller, or a cheaper built one.Nintendo Apps are so-so at the moment, it would be great to have streaming apps such as Netflix for streaming, but other apps such as Youtube have worked well streaming but I do not like the interface for searching for videos.When playing online, after paying for a year subscription, was not as bad as the days of the Nintendo Wii, but it could be better. Wifi play has always been a struggle for companies and consumers that I don't expect to go away with any patch made by Nintendo. Buying the year subscription also includes many nes/snes games you can play with the joy cons in single/multiplayer. My roommate got rehooked playing super mario world and it was a blast seeing someone who says they ""hate games with bad graphics"".Overall, if you're looking for a system for on the go or for a house hold device, the Nintendo Switch is a excellent system with a good range of games to play on.

1909,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,Elegant compromise between handheld and console,"In terms of raw horsepower (CPU, graphics, whatever) the Nintendo Switch is far behind the current generation of consoles like the XBox One.  But, the Switch is a unique device.  As a handheld, it is quite powerful (the latest iteration nearly doubles the handheld's battery life, addressing the Switch's greatest weakness).  This allows you to play the same game on your TV and keep playing it as you take it out with you --- a unique ability.Most importantly, there is a staggering array of software available for it.  Software is what makes or breaks a console, no matter how good it is.For example the Zelda game ""Breath of the Wild"" is a visual stunner with a huge open world.  And this is the first portable system that has the full version of Skyrim available for it (the reason I bought it --- a high quality port of Skyrim with the 3 add-on packs).  Nintendo has also done high quality ports of other gems from older consoles such as ""Mario Kart 8"" as well as a lot of new titles such as ""Super Smash Brothers Ultimate"" or ""Luigi's Mansion 3"".In addition,their digital store has a lot of quality indie games such as Stardew Valley.Also, if you purchase the Nintendo Switch Online membership ($20/year) Nintendo also gives you a large selection of NES and SNES classic games.  The membership is worthwhile for that alone.Basically, because Nintendo is ONLY selling the Switch as a current console (the 3DS is on its way out), all of their best software goes to the one console.  And that gives developers strong incentives to bring their best titles over as well.If you want a wide variety of games, the Switch is a good choice.  If you want THE best console graphics or performance, obviously the Switch isn't for you.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"November 5, 2019",C.

1914,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,This switch saved my marriage.. for now.,"This is my second purchase of a Nintendo Switch Animal Crossing edition. I was bummed out when my wife took my switch hostage claiming it for herself to play Animal Crossing, especially since Monster Hunter Rise had just come out. I was even more bummed out because I had missed out on buying the MHR switch edition because my rationale mind decided I didn’t need a second switch. I was left with 2 options, leave my wife & fight for custody of the switch or purchase another during the shortage brought by on by the epidemic. Surprisingly after a few months of contemplating my decision the switch prices went back down to an affordable price. It still wasn’t easy finding a switch in stores so I took to the internet where I was surprised to see a brand new switch going for regular price. I quickly added the item to my cart & purchased right away! It was delivered with upmost care like a stork bringing me a new baby. Everything was brand new, I was taken back to a simpler time in my life, opening presents on Christmas day. Finally after a quick software update I could play MHR months after its release!

1925,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,Such a cute switch! I love it!,"I couldn't believe my luck when I was able to snag one at MSRP after the release date. It's so cute! I like the design of this one much better than the other switches, and the dock is adorable, especially if you're an Animal Crossing fan. And it's the newer version with improved battery life, too! I was thinking about getting a switch for a while, but the lack of games I absolutely had to have and the colors (I'm not a big fan of the standard colors/designs) put me off. Animal Crossing solved both of these problems with ACNH and this amazing special edition.My only complaint (other than how difficult it was to get - finally caught a restock in the middle of the night and even that sold out in less than 5 minutes) is that sometimes one of the joycons gets stuck when trying to remove it from the strap. It's probably just an issue with mine in particular, but it does make it kind of annoying to remove. I have to put some force into it, and I'm sure that one of these days, I'll accidentally scratch myself trying to remove it. Otherwise, it's very cute, and at MSRP, I'd definitely choose it over the other colors!PS - I hear that this version is restocking, at least in Japan, so absolutely do not buy from scalpers! When I was hunting for this, there were at least 100 being sold by scalpers for ~$500;  now there are just over 20 for $750 each. It's cute, but it's not worth making a scalper $400+ off of other people's desperation.

1930,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,The Switch is riddled with controller disconnects and pairing issues,"After owning the original Wii for years and enjoying it with 0 problems I decided on getting the Switch, even though I mainly play my games on PC now a days, I thought it would be a great console for my wife and I to come together every now and then to play. I was lucky to score one when Nintendo finally got it back in stock after months of no stock because of the pandemic. The first day I got it the right (red) joy con kept disconnecting every 5-10 minutes. I was literally 5 feet away from the console with line of sight. After going through the troubleshooting steps of disconnecting joy cons and updating the console OS and controller firmware, it still had the same problem. The left (blue) joy con worked flawlessly. I searched online and found hundreds if not thousands of posts about people experiencing disconnecting joy cons and various work-arounds. Some even claimed that by having your foot propped up in front of the line of sight would cause all sorts of controller issues including lag and disconnects. So I did my long hours of testing, purchasing new official joy cons, and 3rd parties and am discouraged by my findings.Ultimately I found that the built-in bluetooth radio in the switch is just not powerful enough. Considering the amount of posts regarding controller pairing and disconnects issues, I would say the problem has been known for a long time. And instead of Nintendo recalling or replacing their poorly designed consoles they blame the environment or user error. They state things like ""make sure your console is away from wireless devices of any kind"". Seriously? Everyone has 20 wireless devices in their house from cell phones, routers, modems, smart TV's, wireless speakers, smart hubs, Alexa devices, the list goes on. Nintendo even states to keep the Switch away from fish tanks. Really? Soon they'll be saying to keep the switch away from air and light.I contacted Nintendo within the first week I got the Switch after getting fed up with dying because of constant controller lag and disconnects. Tier 1 support is a joke. They just want you to send it in which customer pays for shipping, and I may get my console back in 30 days. So after back and forth discussion with Tier 1 support I finally found that there is an escalation line which they forwarded me to which seems to be a line of seniors or assistant managers. Again they wanted me to send in the console. I called BS and explained that the console was only a week old. We finally agreed that I would temporarily pay for a replacement right joy con, and only after they received my defective right joy con that I would get reimbursed. New right joy con came, had the same problems albeit it was less noticeable, less disconnects. I sent my old one to them and it took them 30 days to refund my money which was $50 because they had to inspect the controller for any damage or mods. Seriously? I eventually got my money back but what a pain.Fast forward about a month and lag and disconnects are still happening. I purchased a brand new official joy con from Amazon and even though it hasn't outright disconnected it has shown lag issues again, sitting 5 feet away from the console and with direct line of sight. I even started unplugging wireless devices like my wireless speaker, just to see if anything would increase the controllers range and reliability and nothing helped.At the end of the day the Nintendo Switch is riddled with controller issues and I am not even getting into the whole ""drifting"" problem that people are suing Nintendo over. Now a days it seems that companies just release untested unreliable electronics, even the all and might Nintendo company, and don't take responsibility for it. A player needs reliable controllers to play a consoles content AKA joy con controllers for the Nintendo Switch, like a player needs a reliable mouse and keyboard for playing PC games. And for the price tag of an official Nintendo Switch joy con set at around $70 I expect them to be flawless, and their from from it. And this console isn't even new. It's been out for several years and Nintendo has had plenty of time to fix their issues, and they have chosen to blame us, the consumers instead of taking ownership of the problem.I plan to exchange the Switch for another using the Amazon exchange policy. Luckily, my purchase qualified for the holiday return policy so I have until February 1st to return it. If the new one acts up the same way I will be returning it and will be calling my credit card company to reimburse the 4 games I purchased from the Switch store since the Nintendo store has a no refund policy, which is a complete joke and such a policy should be discouraged.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"January 3, 2021",Jay,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGCAYHDBTZRSHW7Q4YIEDURGUECQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True
1931,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,Won my sisters heart!,"Alright so since the Covid-19 outbreak has officially ruined my sisters senior year she had started getting into animal crossing.

Also so she could get a taste of Animal Crossing new horizons for when it comes out March 20th, 2020!  The day I told her I purchased it she hopped with joy. I was excited too considering I was sharing my own excitement for animal crossing with my sister. It had finally arrived. Its box didn't come in damaged and the console was packed safely to prevent possible damages. It works perfectly as any nintendo switch should with no defects at all in the console itself. The only concerns I have to remind future buyers is that the joycons will stop working properly after a year of use. This is coming from my own nintendo switch experiences and other fellow switch owners where the controls will drift randomly while you're trying to play a game after a year after consistant use. So I'd be best to invest in a second set of controllers just in case.All I have left to say is that this was indeed worth my money and my sister couldn't be happier with her early senior graduation gift!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"March 20, 2020",Chloe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGPYONWLGEBQDFVWDPPQ2X4HLF3A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

1933,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,"Purchased 'used', feels like new.","I've been wanting a switch for a long time, and finally managed to get my hands on one close to MSRP (at $307) during the pandemic. I only have one game on it so far, but to say I'm pleased and impressed so far is a bit of an understatement. It's nice to be able to play on my TV in the living room, and when someone else wants to play their own game or watch Netflix, I can just take the switch out of the dock and play in handheld mode, but stay in the same room and socialize. I like being able to bring the game into my room and not be forced to play it in the living room if I don't want to deal with all the noise.It's pleasant to hold, with just a bit of weight to it to feel sturdy. The Joycons are nice to the touch, although the sticks are a little too 'smooth' for my liking so I put some grips on. I haven't experienced any drift, yet, but it's only been a few days. They're very satisfying to hold, and even more satisfying to click into place on either the tablet or the included joy-con grip. I haven't tried the straps yet.The screen is lovely, and the speakers are front-facing so it seems louder than other handhelds. It IS a little frustrating to adjust the volume while I have it on the kickstand. The kickstand is a pain to pull out, and isn't sturdy in the slightest.Overall I'm very, very happy with it. I can't wait to get more games on it and play with friends.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"May 27, 2020",Sarah Murray,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGZ7YNHFZAMNHTFGB5LQA2THFZTQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True
1934,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,Before you buy...,I managed to snatch a retail price Switch away from scalpers somehow.  Which took about two months of attempts to pull off!  Anyways here is my honest assessment after watching repair videos.The Switch is an excellent console at an excellent value (As long as you can obtain one at MSRP).  However being what it is the Switch itself is fairly fragile.  If your child has the self control of Angry German Kid(tm) this would not be the best gift for them.  And if playing it in undocked mode understand by all that is holy that the Nintendo Switch is not a modern smartphone.  There is no water resistance built into the design.  Submerging the switch or even spilling something onto it will likely be the end of the console.  The docking port is another point of fragility.  It won't suffer being slammed into the dock well.  All of the weight of the unit is baring down on that port while docking so being gentle and sorta gingerly easing it down is advised.  The Joycons are also rather fragile.  Not flimsy but they won't tolerate mauling like let's say a PS1 controller could take.That being said I do not think the Switch is cheaply made at all despite these points.  The owner and operator just has to accept that they need to be gentle and they'll be fine.  And I don't mean you need to treat it like a china cup.  But this is NOT the kind of console for a roid rage neanderthal hopped up on Monster drinks and adrenaline.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"June 23, 2020",Blimlimlim,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEAV2C3A5EQRCX4GHXGY65K5YVRA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

1936,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,Tons of games to choose from,"Great system.  My son owns one but has it with him at college so I decided to get one for myself and I must say it's got such a huge selection of games.  I still have my 3ds but didn't realize how much Nintendo had expanded on game selection and variety. I'm a huge animal crossing fan so I bought this version of Switch since I played the first one on the 3ds.  Their online eshop, accessible through an online connection, has an almost endless selection of games.  You can buy physical copies or digital copies of games and some are digital only through the eshop.  As a longtime gamer (I own a PS4 and original owner of a regular NES I bought in 1989), I can honestly say this is Nintendo's best system since you can play it on your TV but also take it with you (portable) like a 3ds.  You can also play games on it offline so you don't have to always be connected to the internet.  This is a console that is great for all ages of people, young or old and when I'm tired of hack and slash on my PS4, the Switch has many chill titles of games to relax with.

1943,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,It's everything I could've ever dreamed of and more.,"I had experience with the Switch since my family had a shared one for a while, but sometimes you get tired of passing the console around so I got one of my own! I'm so glad I was able to get the New Horizons one because it's so much cuter in person and as an avid Animal Crossing fan since the 2001 Gamecube release here in the west, it's just so good. It took a while since this design is so popular but when I finally caught it during a restock period I knew I had to grab it!I love the color scheme, and seeing Tom Nook with Timmy and Tommy on a lil' island is so precious <3 The all around aesthetic makes it feel like both a console and an artpiece dedicated to your new journey on a deserted island.If you're a big AC fan who can afford to get it and you're able to grab one when they're in stock, I'd say to go for it.

1944,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,Love the ACNH switch,"Call me crazy.....I bought the original switch a while ago and never played Animal Crossing before. When everyone was talking about New Horizon during the start of the Pandemic, I thought to give it a shot. Boy, I should not have done it :) I started spending all my free time paying off my loans to Tom Nook, hunting for villagers and trying to decorate my Island. Like many, I got kinda bored after everything was unlocked and got tired of the Villagers repeating the same over and over again. I thought of resetting my Island, but didn't want to lose everything I had worked for so hard. Then Nintendo announce to release the ACNH special edition switch again and beside I didn't like the idea of buying another switch, it was a great opportunity to start another Island with an ACNH themed switch. Anyway, I didn't regret spending another $299 - the switch is VERY cute and fits perfectly on my shelf. Beside still having my old switch with a developed, but basically abandoned  Island I mostly play on the new ACNH switch now. I know it's very hard to reset your Island, but if you don't have the money to buy another system, you may want to consider it.

There is a limited selection of AAA games, more so if you like action and FPS genres. You have more than enough RPGs to choose from and a lot of the Asian anime style games (not sure what they're called). Nintendo's own selection is PG as always. It sounds odd to say this, but my mistake was buying this when I'm not a Nintendo fan. The lack of support from major developers and studios means that I eventually turned to a laptop to meet my real gaming needs.PROS:Gaming on the move: great on airiplanes and to bring on tripsEasy couch coop for supported gamesHolds charge for a good amount of timeMain console body is durable AF. I dropped mine down a flight of stairs and it had no dentsCONS:Joycons are a straight rip-off. They will fail on you then you'll have to pay 40-60 USD for replacementsLimited game selection (this is the biggest issue). Almost none of the large developers are supporting the Switch. Some of them are trying, but the Switch hardware is already behind the times with current-gen releases and you get knocked-down graphics.

1952,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,My son likes it,"My nine-year-old son saved and worked in order to buy a Nintendo Switch. He bought it with his own money and I couldn't be prouder of him. We bought the Animal Crossing edition only because it would have been available earlier than the standard version. He said he didn't care how it looked as long as it could play Switch games. Originally, Amazon delivered a completely unrelated package and said it was the Switch, but their customer service sent the replacement as soon as the issue was reported. Kudos to Amazon for that. My son has only used it in handheld mode since there isn't a TV available for his use. He has never placed it in the dock so I don't know how that would work. We've had it for a couple of weeks at this point. Here is my son's review:I like it. It's been good so far. Its most impressive feature is the battery life. One charge can last for six hours of continuous gameplay. It also charges more quickly than any other device I've ever had. It goes from around 4% to 25% in 10 to 15 minutes.

When Pokemon moved to the Switch, ""some point"" became ""right now"".Nintendo likes to make their consoles unique. The DS Lite had two screens, a touch screen, and a microphone that were all used to make the experience unique. The 3DS, The Wii, and Wii U also had their own interesting elements. At times, it just felt gimmicky. The Switch on the other hand, doesn't feel that way at all.It's the gaming equivalent of a laptop with a docking station. You can have the TV experience like any other console, which is also great for party games. Then you can take it with you. This is basically THE go to gaming device for plane rides. The joycons are also genius. It is just incredibly versatile.I'm pleased that it has USB C. The Dock is easy to connect to as it literally just drops in place. I do think it could use more apps. it pretty much only has Hulu and YouTube at the time of this review, if I'm remembering correctly. I am a bit of a geek so I have plenty of other devices to watch on, but if it wants to compete with some of the other devices, it would be nice to have the option of watching Netflix, for example.I remember when the Wii first came out, and you'd go play the sports games with whoever had one.

It came with little dust and packaging particles but I believe it was just from the warehouse storage that got into the hole the box has. I’ve been playing multiplayer for 2hrs now and it works perfectly fine! If you can wait, don’t buy 3rd party and do AMAZON. Totally worth it and really, really cute! I bought it MSRP btw ($299). No overpriced, scalped switch!Shipping: I bought it as a pre-order for the next month. It changed to arriving next week to this Sunday for me! There’s a chance it will be the same for you too! So if you can wait, be patient, look out for pre-orders (they are available every now and then) & buy it MSRP ($299)! It’ll be worth it!UPDATE AFTER 1 DAY:Just found out 1 vent on the back of the switch is loose and your able to push it in. I don’t know if this will be okay but review looses a star for this :(.

1974,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,Beautiful Special Edition!,"I got to admit, I was a little ticked off at Nintendo that the day this switch arrived at my doorstep, they announced the OLED Switch.That being said I am VERY happy with this purchase!  This console is beautiful and is a very nice upgrade to my launch day Switch that died last month.  Throw on a couple of pretty cases to help protect this and you have an amazing set up on your hands.  Nintendo has always made high quality consoles and special editions like this Animal Crossing Switch help showcase that very well.  Now even though the OLED was announced as well, it looks like the same specs just with a better screen.  Very nice for those who prefer handheld mode.  I use mine in the dock most of the time so I didn't really need that.TLDR: If you want a really nice Special Edition Switch then don't be dismayed by the OLED announcement.... the Animal Crossing console is very nice and well worth the money. 👌",5.0 out of 5 stars,"July 6, 2021",Craig Campbell,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH7SFXJQIOMDLTYTMIFNUUI7XDWQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

1979,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,BEST B-DAY PRESENT EVER !!!,"We bought this for my 7-year-old son's birthday & he couldn't be happier!! This is by far the most adorable Nintendo switch console out there!! I definitely recommend purchasing it.We bought it when it was $300 plus tax. I do not recommend paying any more than that price.. just wait till it gets back in stock & buy it for $300. Do not purchase it from greedy scalpers.. keep an eye out because as soon as it gets in stock it sells out usually the same day! We are so fortunate we were able to get one in time for my son's birthday ..we purchased this back in October & held on to it till December for his birthday. If you want one for Christmas, I doubt you will be able to get one at the $300 price ..unfortunately it's sold out till mid January.. but if you can I say go ahead & get it! This thing is adorable & really is a great collector item for any Nintendo fan! Even if they aren't into animal crossing. It is a very unisex design. I believe it can be for a boy or a girl. 👍",5.0 out of 5 stars,"December 8, 2020",GoldenBunny90,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHURVDTVRWQ3VGF4CR5XAYC66I6Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

1981,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,Nintendo Switch w/Grey joy cons V2 HAC-001(-01),"This review is for the Nintendo Switch w/Grey joycons, V2 HAC-001(-01). I've owned the original Switch(HAC 001) and recently, the Switch Lite(Turquoise). Battery life wasn't so good with the original Switch and only a bit better with the Lite. This Switch model has improved battery life, up to 40% depending on brightness settings, volume settings, and the type of game you're playing. Another thing I've noticed is if you download digital games, it takes less time. The graphics(colors) seem to be more vibrant.If you're a gamer who likes to play games on the T.V exclusively, this would be the perfect choice. On the other hand,someone who enjoys gaming on the go, might find it cumbersome carrying this console around. It won't fit in your pocket. Just something to keep in mind.Lastly; if you buy plenty of digital games, a micro sd card of 32-128gb is a must. Another basic necessity would be a glass screen protector, as the plastic screen does scratch easily. There are two models, one with the grey joy cons and one with the red and blue joy cons. The Switch with the red and blue joy cons seems to be the rarer model and is sought after by gamers for it's resell value. There are plenty of games available for the Switch, something for everyoneand more to come. If you have your old Switch, it isn't really necessary to upgrade to this newer model. However; just for the improved battery life, I would recommend it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"December 8, 2019",Mr. James,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG7VFIHNGHSM34SCRNUQ5MHXUBNQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

1985,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,"If you love being around people, get the Switch!","I absolutely loved the concept of the Nintendo Switch and decided to get one due to its popular demand. It’s pretty awesome and best to get it at the normal price of $299.99 because it really isn’t worth $300.00+ and it really refreshes the gaming atmosphere. However, handheld mode is so enormous that it’s a little uncomfortable. I was on the fence about buying this or the Nintendo Switch Lite, because I rarely have anyone else around to play some really cool multiplayer games like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe or Super Smash Bros. Plus, the Switch Lite doesn’t come with controller/joy con problems and is smaller, more comfortable, and accessible. One other thing that stands out on the Lite is it has a smaller screen but games look a bit sharper on it. That said, some of the free games are pretty addictive! I think it was totally worth the $300.00, but it does cost $20 to buy Nintendo Online to play any Nintendo game’s online player. I also wouldn’t recommend buying a Pro controller because the joy con controller is pretty comfortable, so far. If you’re someone who loves hanging around friends and family, get the regular Switch. If you’re a solo and lone wolf type of badass, get the Switch Lite!",4.0 out of 5 stars,"January 28, 2021",Mikel Ilasco,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFQTSXKJV23AAO6KIG6YOJ32Y7MA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True
1986,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,Decent console with a nice option for the tv/projector,"Hey, it's a Nintendo for 2021. It's fast, simple, and the games are clean. No long loading times and the controls are fairly intuitive. Battery life on the joy-cons is great, though the handheld version is a little lackluster... that's fixed by treating it like a standard console though... so yay.Only real sticking point is the price. For 300 bucks, it feels a bit steep. Many of the games feel like time-eaters for casual players, and there's no browsing or media to speak of. Again though, this is Nintendo and as a game console, it plays games. They play smoothly and have a very finished feel to them.

1988,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,Love the Switch,"I want to start by getting the obvious out of the way. Scalpers = Trash, and I cannot believe with everything going on right now that Amazon is allowing them to sell at such inflated prices.  Wait for the official Amazon restocks because they charge MSRP, now onto the Switch.Love it. I cannot say that enough.  The console won't blow you away, but it will keep you entertained for hours. Whether you play in docked mode or handheld mode, they both work very well and looks very good on both screens.  The battery on this generation is much improved over the day 1 release.  The battery itself is the same size, but Nintendo put in a more efficient processor which extends the battery life.The game selection is wide and varied, if you like shooters, you can find them here. If you like platformers, look nowhere else, you have some of the greatest ever made. Not just this generation, but former generations in the Nintendo Eshop.The rundown is the Switch is a great console and worth the $299, just wait until Amazon gets it back in stock, stay far away from this worthless scalpers.Last note: Follow @FatKidAlerts on Twitter, he is always keeping up with Switch stock on Amazon, and that is how I finally got mine for MSRP.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"June 1, 2020",Chris S.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFA62XW5CVHTVXWBIOJKXVC7YQAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

The joy cons come on and off easily but stay in place when you want them to.

We bought the online subscription as well as the expansion pack and quite frankly I’m not terribly impressed Xbox was a much better set up online. No surprisingly when I signed up for my switch subscription it told me I already had a profile because of my Xbox subscription. Huh? Ya don’t say. Anyway it’s all connected and now we are too kids love it.

That being said Mums Collectibles & Stuff is by far the cheapest I have seen a new switch go for on amazon, ebay or a number of other websites.On top of all of this one I bought the item from them they had it ready and shipped the next day as I did buy it rather late at night. With an estimated arrival time of 2 weeks I actually received it a week early which I give my thanks to UPS.

1999,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,The cutest!,"Needless to say, the Nintendo Switch is so much fun and a great way to kill time.  But on top of that, this particular console's Animal Crossing theme is just the cutest I've ever seen.  I never liked the primary-looking colors of the OG console, so the soft blue and mint green joy con colors really appealed to me.  The back of the switch itself has rivers and islands etched onto it as well!  It's the little details that really make a difference for me.  The dock is a light cream color with the raccoon travel agents on the bottom right.  I'm so glad this set was available again because, although I'm sure I'd be happy with the OG console, I'm so much happier with my Animal Crossing edition.  It makes me smile every time I see it.

On top of it all I received it within days of ordering, picked it up early from the post office and I’ve played it at least once a day since owning it. The fact that it’s the updated version of the Switch with a better battery life means I can play longer on the go, and I don’t think a review of this version of the console would be complete without mentioning the gorgeous Animal Crossing New Horizons designs on the box and dock.

2006,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,Nintendo Switch,"It's really nice to take your console game anywhere you want! It sucks that Nintendo didn't give us enough storage space, so make sure you buy a microSD card to store your games and their content. I read that it's better to buy the physical game discs. They take up less space, but if you want to download all of your games go for it. If you play a medium amount of games I would recommend the 256GB - 512GB microSD cards. There is a 1TB microSD card on amazon for around $300.00. Get this one if you're a hardcore Nintendo player. There are many accessories on amazon to also decorate your Switch. You can decorate the controllers with skins or buy the different color joy-cons. The exclusive Pickachu one has nice Pichachu designs on the stand, and I think there's also an Eevee version both from Japan that cost $500 or more.

2008,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,Brand New Animal Crossing Edition Switch for MSRP,"For anyone looking to get an Animal Crossing Edition Switch without paying more than retail price, my advice is to be patient and check back here frequently.

Just make sure the listing says ""Ships from and sold by Amazon.com"" to ensure it's not a third party seller and that the price is exactly $299.99.In terms of the product itself, I had already been playing on another Switch for a while and it's a great console (aside from the infamous joycon drift issue). My preferred play style is docked on the TV but it works perfectly on handheld mode as well. The Animal Crossing edition is super cute with its pastel joycons and ACNH-themed dock, I highly recommend it!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"February 1, 2021",Nikki,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGBCMJLEKRBMQUZY64C6M3SLRJMA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True
2009,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,Was exactly what it said it was!,"I was really skeptical purchasing this switch off Amazon based off of the reviews, but I went for it and so glad I did! It came brand new, no scratches and in its original packaging. I have been playing on it everyday since I got it with no issues as well.

2010,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,One of the Coolest Gaming Devices I’ve Owned,"The only time I’ve used a Switch has been playing on one that my friends own. Just these experiences has really intrigued me into getting my very own Switch. I love playing video games and I own an Xbox and PS4, so I figure at some point it was time to complete the trifecta. While I’m more of an Xbox person, I will say I am very impressed by the Switch. It is a very simple console, but genius in of itself. I’ve had some Nintendo gaming devices here and there. A SNES back in the day, but mostly their portable ones from the Gameboy to the Advanced to the DS and 3DS. The Switch combines that of a home console and a portable gaming device and for that I love it. I can put it in the dock and play it on my TV. I can play it handheld which will be great for road trips or maybe just wanting to play anywhere. This was a brilliant move by Nintendo and it makes the Switch really stand on its own.Now what I’d say my favorite thing about the console is it’s simplicity. This device is made for one thing only and that is for playing video games. The console is both modern and old school at the same time. Would definitely recommend to anyone who really likes Nintendo and their games.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"March 7, 2020",Matthew Welker,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH5Y4RYZ37BOL235TKBMVHDNNODQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

2012,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,Nintendo Switch #2,"Here is what happened. I already had a Nintendo Switch but I didn’t play with it for a few months so when I wanted to use it it had no power. I put it on the dock to charge and nothing. I thought it was dead forever so I ordered a new one from Amazon. Later I went to see if my old Nintendo would power up after I charged it. What I was not doing is pushing in the power button enough, after I pushed the Nintendo powered up. So now I own 2 Nintendo’s. It’s great to have 2. This new NS works great just like the old one. I could care the less about the game Animal Crossing but I like how the NS looks. Also there was waiting time if I wanted the exact one I have. Over all the NS is great! In fact I like it better then Sony play Station or X-box I don’t even play them anymore. I love it I can play the old games from Nintendo and others. The first game I played was PONG back in the day.

2015,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,Joysticks stopped working,"My family has been an XBox family for some time, but with a toddler we were looking for something a little more family friendly so we purchased the Nintendo Switch. The idea is mind blowing, but the functionality is inferior to other gaming systems I've owned. I haven't even had it for a year and the joysticks don't work like they should. They work on the controller but it doesn't translate in gameplay. If I try to turn and look around my television screen (or the screen on the Switch) just stays in the same position. Or if I try to move my character a specific way, it goes a completely different way on the screen.

2017,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,10/10 Recommend,"This is my third switch so that I can have three Animal Crossing islands because I’m insane, also I have severe ocd - same thing I guess?, and I am absolutely in love with the AC theme. I have a different style/color for each one so I can tell the islands apart but this one is def my fave. The Switch is my console. I have played a couple of games on ps4 (Atelier games that weren’t out on Switch until more recently), but now that those games are on Switch I will get them as soon as they go on sale. I love the handheld option because I can play while my husband watches something on our tv, and I love that it can also be docked so I can see things on the big screen. I play mostly handheld. It plays smoothly with the joycons and a pro controller. You can even play with a pro controller when it’s not docked if you don’t want to/can’t use the joycons. I’m sorry about the novella.

Missed a couple then finally had some used listings straight from Amazon for get this, $280!Order was delivered in two days.  Came in original box and had everything in packaging basically like it was new.  Screen had a protrctive film which was cool.  All controllers and adapters were nicely placed in plastic sleeves.  Everything was pretty much flawless.  The only thing is one joy con had barely any battery and the other was dead.  Not a huge deal got it charged in dock quickly.Everything was factory reset and when I started it up it was like it had never been turned on.DON'T BE SCARED TO BUY USED!

I would literally check every month (since April) to see if maybe a store had this in stock, but sadly at the time, it was only third-party sellers selling at a huge markup price.By October, I decided to check one last time hoping that someone was selling at a decent price and to my surprise Amazon and several other retailers had this back in stock! Bought it right away because from my understanding this was supposed to be a limited edition item and didn’t want to miss the opportunity to own it.Got it in no time and I love it. It’s such a pretty color. It came around a good time since a lot of Switch games have gone on sale for the holiday.

2033,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,Product is great! Resellers... not so much!,"TLDR: Product is SO CUTE!! BUT doesn’t do anything special compared to a regular Switch (other than give 10/10 on aesthetic) so don’t buy unless you can afford it/the look it worth it to you.Long review:This product is amazing!! The pastel colors are so cute and the texture on the back adds a great extra touch. The dock has an AC graphic on it which was a great addition tomy living room! The packaging is also well thought out leading to a great unboxing experience. Of course this works exactly like every other Nintendo switch, so this is entirely about aesthetic.With all of that said, the price gouging on this product is insane. Because it is a limited edition the reselling price is crazy, and because it does nothing a normal Switch can’t do, so purchasing this is a novelty. If you have the cash to drop go for it (I was lucky enough to get one at the normal price). But as I was hunting one down when they were first announced, I watched people buy them up and list them at inflated prices before it even came out. So maybe consider if you want to give those people your money.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"April 3, 2020",Ali,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGCIUK6FOYVHJ424DK2JC4QWJOBQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

2037,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,One Year Later as a Switch owner,"I’ve had my Switch for about a year now and I can say it’s a very fun console. It’s no where near as powerful as the PS4 or Xbox but the fact that I can take my games on a road trip or play it at home is pretty awesome and convenient for gamers. The Joy-Cons do get loose however over time and will slide off without having to press the release button so I would recommend getting a grip or a case like the picture shown above. Another thing I wan to mention is the joy con drift, which can get really annoying at times. Having to calibrate them in the settings menu every other minute can be really annoying and for others, ruin the experience. I usually use a pro controller while playing on docked mode and I don’t run into any issues but the problem persists when I’m playing on table top or handheld. Besides the minor inconvenience here and there, I think the Nintendo Switch is great, especially with third party games like Skyrim or the Witcher 3 being ported over to the Switch.

The game cartridge part is a little hard to take out at first too and I thought I broke It but it’s flimsy plastic so it bends.The controllers are kinda small if you have larger hands.I would also recommend a screen protector, carrying case, and a stand (so you don’t have to keep opening the kickstand it comes with)",5.0 out of 5 stars,"August 12, 2020",Brianne,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGHDRFHLEBXEJEYWTNXMHV2XNAXA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

As I was looking I was so lucky to see the animal crossing special edition back in stock and not at a scalping price. But at the normal price of 299.99, but when the first package was delivered it got stolen because Amazon delivery didn't know, customer service at first had an aditude with me. I had assume they didn't believe me that it was stolen. But it was and at the end of the day. Im so grateful they were able to replace the console with out Me having to get my money back because I saw that the price instantly jump from 299.99 to 360.00 which I would never recomend buying it at that price.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"April 5, 2021",Dru Rodriguez,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AETQBBNU34LKDC7AXSWSLOBKLYLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True
2052,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,Some points - From months after purchasing,"Awesome Console I get to run many games I've never gotten to play before, here's a few things:The screen and around it get items or ""spots"" Items and spots as it the tiny crack between the screen and the rest of the console, same goes with the speakers but you could use a toothpick or something small.The spots that I talk about look like if water or any other liquid had dried on the screen even though I never drink n play and they usually can be removed with ease(by rubbing) however I've had to use the backing of one of my rainbow pins to break it down so it could be scraped off with my fingernail. Thankfully it didn't scratch up the screen.  Quality, certain games that are usually meant for quality look absolute garbage on switch(dbd, subnautica/below zero, etc). this usually can be fixed if you set it up on TV and up the quality or toggle with the settings however if you're on the go and wanna enjoy the game it'll be rather difficult. The Battery is still golden after a long time use! Pricing; when this console was bought it was 240-300 now its way more? This is a scam Nintendo!If anyone is looking for something like this just invest your money elsewhere like maybe the switch lite or one of the DS's. It's not worth it.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"September 10, 2021",MsPANDORA,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFNUSYM7NANPTXJAX35OCSZGLRDA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True
2053,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,Not Impressed,"I expected a bit more when it came to the Switch and I was a bit let down. First of all, I feel like the design is counter-intuitive especially the docking system. I don't understand why you need to place the entire tablet in-between such a cramped space where you could accidentally scratch up the device. There are so many bells and whistles that snap on and off it becomes rather annoying just to play a simple game. You can scratch up the joycons just by sliding them into the joycon grips. Why did you design it that way? The kickstand on the back of the Switch is a joke. It's so hard to open and isn't long enough to support the device. Also since, the power cord plug is directly under the device, you can't plug it in when you're using the kickstand. So many design irregularities and inconveniences. Fifty million buttons all over the place, which means fifty million ways to play one game and hold the controllers. It's so chaotic and annoying. Fun features such a streetpass and an internet browser are not on this device. This device still isn't powerful enough to compete with Playstation or Xbox. Just playing this device in your hand is a struggle because it is so freaking huge and weighty. I wouldn't buy this for a child, they can stick with the 3ds. To be honest, I had more fun playing on my 3ds and vita than the Switch.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"August 9, 2021",AmazonCustomer,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEUAQ6BAUEBP2C754LR3ILYHP54Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True
2054,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,Best Nintendo Switch for $299.99 but Avoid Scalpers!!!!!,This is the best switch for this year  I bought is at original price of 299.99 which is a great deal for this special animal crossing edition  worth the money  as you can see in the photos and video of unboxing everything is there and brand new I cant believe I have it. It was sold out everywhere but now thanks to my dad I have it for Christmas eve  when we open the gifts I Am so ecstatic and excited for Christmas eve thanks Nintendo for the best switch ever but it does not include the game  but that's ok because I already have it but if you are going to get this for your kids or for yourself for family fun avoid scalpers I hate them they suck also if you want  buy the switch and game itself it is a great game and I guarantee you will have a blast playing it,5.0 out of 5 stars,"December 16, 2020",GEORGETTA,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHZEHITHN2CKIEQPBOH6UJ2L3NEQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

I also purchased a few other Nintendo switch games and enjoy them as well. One recommendation I would pass on is “not” buying the actual game cartridge but buying the downloadable version as you won’t worry about losing the tiny cartridge as my son did, but we later fixed them, I was upset at the thought of $60 dollars going down the drain as I should have bought the download so I wouldn’t have that issue.

The online subscription they offer for a measly 20 bucks a year offers a library of nes and snes games you can play at will. You can save state in them as well up to 4 save files for each game. You can ALSO reverse time when playing (it is a cheap feature but VERY cool still) Died in mario, just hold in two buttons, reverse the game like a dvr on tv show and bam, try that part again right where you just were!! i do not know if it is true but i read they have two more slots for future classic systems in their coding in the system. We have Nintendo 8bit, Super Nintendo but we could see Nintendo 64 or game cube in the future as well.All 5 games i picked up for it run great as well, no complaints except it was 150 dollars more than list price.

I really don’t care if it’s not “4K, 60fps”.The controls are super advanced. Li always play with the grip, even if Motion controls are recommended. I don’t personally own a Pro controller for the switch, but I’ll consider it. I have a Wii U Pro-controller which is my favorite controller for the system.The Switch approves upon the Wii U in most ways. The Wii U does however possess a better UI, more comfortable controls, and Virtual console.Overall the Nintendo Switch is worth the hunt and the money.

However, the controller had an issue.  It would only work for an hour or so and then would say, ""problem connecting.""  Of course this meant I wasn't able to use the controllers.  I actually purchased two pro-controllers that worked great with the game.  Amazon connected me to Nintendo service team and they tried to help me reset the controller but that didn't work. They said that I needed to send back the game so that they could try to repair it and if that didn't work they would need to send me another game.  I just returned this and got the Nintendo switch blue/red console instead. That one works perfectly without any issues so far.

I love the portability of it on the go and the ability to allow multiple players play at once. For $300 I think this is a solid gaming console that can be used to pour hundreds of hours into and still find games refreshing. The Nintendo game lineup also has the best exclusives out of the other competitors, from Mario to Zelda to Animal Crossing, there’s a game that suits anyone’s taste. Of course there are improvements to be made such as the joycons being small and sometimes uncomfortable in the even if you put it in together like a controller, it still doesn’t replace the feeling of a real full sized controller. In the future, I would just like Nintendo to make the portable screen 1080p with a 120hz refresh rate for an even better gaming experience.

They were very quick to realize their mistake and corrected it right away. I actually got the email the same day the accessories arrived so it was absolutely fine in my book.

The reviews were pretty glowing for the Switch and I can say they’re warranted. Just make sure you buy the newer generation (this product) so you have better battery life and less decline over the life of the product.I love how Nintendo the Parental Controls essentially live within an app on the parent’s phone. A motivated kid can hack just about anything so keeping these settings non-local is a brilliant little safeguard. My kids have to ask me for “more time” when they’ve hit a daily limit (which is customizable for the day of the week). It’s very much like a simpler, more reliable version of Apple’s Screen Time feature on iPhones. Of course, you can also unlock more time on the switch itself using a pin code.It’s also worth mentioning that Nintendo did a great job with the “user assisted driving” feature on Mario Kart that helps young kids and inexperienced gamers be competitive.

Yes, it was overpriced, I think this was worth it, I personally got it for the Joy-cons, and I don't regret it, because you really don't know when you will get the opportunity to get one for less. Anyways, arrived in perfect condition, first switch ever, the only thing that was wrong is the Left Bumper on the Joy-con, which i don't know how to explain it but kind of loose, more than the Right Bumper. It bothers me because of something on the inside, and also since I paid a lot for this switch but not enough to complain, its just something i'll have to live with. But besides that, it was a great experience, the bumper was the only thing that gave me a fright since it feels very weird.

Joy-cons(controllers) connect right away once attached through wireless electrical conduction like a power mat.The U.I. makes me happy.

2095,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,Incredibly fun! Can also use parental control to track playtime and protect console from siblings,"I bought this just to play Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and it didn't disappoint in the least! It's incredibly fun!One cool feature is that if you set up Parental Control using the free app, it will tell you how long you've played each day. Since I'm neither a parent nor do I need to be controlled, I disable restrictions and play-time limit so it doesn't actually interfere when I'm playing, but it is a bit sobering to see that yesterday I played for 6 hrs and 40 min.Also, if you set the play-time limit to 0 min everyday, the console will prompt you to disable Parental Control via a PIN. This could come in very handy if you have a sibling or roommate who likes to steal your Switch.I would also recommend getting a screen cover, either plastic or glass. I have a glass one that adheres like a second screen and haven't had any trouble yet, but then again I've only had it for 8 days and treat it very carefully.Overall, a great product, and worth every penny!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"April 3, 2020",Bean Mathews,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH6GBLH4COTJEBS7Q7L3MP36VVUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

2098,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,Excellent Device sold from an Excellent Seller,"I thoroughly enjoy the size, versatility, and portability of this product! Easily one of the best handheld devices ever manufactured. Nintendo has completely out classed their competition with this wonderful piece of machinery that is guaranteed to have you busy for hours. And this is coming from a die-hard Sony fan :). The sleek but comfortable design of the joycons makes intense gameplay surprisingly seamless. Their massive game selection ranges from AAA titles, to RPGs, First Person Shooters, and MUCH MORE. There is so much more that could be said, however, it’s too much to type! Lol. If you’re looking for an excellent game console that you can play either casually or continuously, look no further. Additionally, if you’re like me (frugal) and you’re on the fence about shelling out the money, don’t be; it’s worth every penny. Also, this seller moved my shipping up to one day shipping FOR FREE!!!

2100,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,Great,"I was suppose to receive my package October 27th. I didn't receive my package until the 29th. It wasn't Amazon fought at all. I blame USPS for screwing up. They sent my package to the wrong address. So I had to go online and have them redeliver my package.When I finally receive my package I notice it wasn't damaged or tampered with. The switch box was still intact thank God. One thing I notice is the switch itself looks more premium if that makes any type of sense. Lol You can tell they fixed a lot issues with the joycons and other things. My OG switch had so many flaws. My TV screen would go black then turn back on for some reason while playing. The vents on my switch ended up melting off. The back had so many scratches from the dock.Anywho, the battery life is amazing!! If you're like me and you play your switch an hour a day. It will last for a couple days. If you're the type that play your switch for hrs. You can get up to 9hrs of play depending on the game you're playing.Im glad I got the upgraded version. 5/5",5.0 out of 5 stars,"October 31, 2019",The Gamer,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGBMSUG6EAS4MGBAGJIFAMCRBDUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True
2101,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,For the child inside all of us,"I love my Switch, this console really brings me back to my childhood, there is something about it that recaptured that magic I felt playing my Super Nintendo and even the GameCube. I've played every Nintendo console and while I was a major fan of the early ones, after the Cube, I got sucked into the Xbox 360 and then the PS4, but, this console is the first I've played in years that brings me back to that childhood magic. I got this console on a whim after watching Detective Pikachu and realizing how much I missed Pokémon games, so I had to get Let's Go Pikachu and pre-order Pokémon Shield, as well as getting back into Mario, and checking out Fire Emblem Warriors which is totally amazing. All in all, not only are the exclusive games amazing, but, the console and even the joycon controller rig are something special. I can't put my finger on it, and I really can't put it into words, but this is a great system and for kids or those trying to rediscover the child inside of them, this is a must have. Just don't try to get inside a child with this is, or you're going to jail sicko.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"October 22, 2019",Lottie C.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEKVZLXSVMT2DU6QRBETX42H7UHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

I first purchased the Nintendo Switch about 2.5 years ago.  recently, there was a problem with the Switch and it stopped turning on.  I called Amazon, at which time they let me know that I surpasses my warranty on the item.  I immediately was disappointed and than immediately relieved for the next thing the Amazon representative told me was that I was going to be able to receive a $340 refund of the 399 i spent on the item.  After 30 months, if you tell me that I would receive almost a full refund after my warranty had run out... I am still in shock.Now as for the Switch itself... We love it.  It's not a Playstation 4 or Xbo 10000 or something.  But it's a great family system that also is great for when friends and relatives visit.

2108,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,It's Nintendo's newest generation console - you know what this is.,"I'm mainly going to list off the pros for this unit, something I like that they did on this generation compared to the other consoles by Nintendo and some gripes.Portability obviously with its docking capabilities - very good move.  The way the Switch locates itself within the dock is a cool party trick.  I like not having to have a rucksack full of gear just to bring my system with.The Joy-Con controllers are passable and you can actually play 2P games with each one.  I do wish they offered a Pro-controller bundled version.The setup of the system is easy, you don't have to fill out another mortgage worth of EULAs to play.For pennies you get a slew of NES and SNES games through Nintendo Online.Mario Maker 2 is pretty fun and I wished more games had BYO levels like it(cue the wave of gamers that will correct me on 20+ games that have their own world-building options. I'm 43 and don't have time for games like I did in my teens.

2109,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,Beautiful Switch - Definitely worth the buy if you can find one,"Definitely love how bright the colors are on this switch, more of a neon pastel shade. The switch is the V2, which has extended battery life and a more efficient CPU. Comparing this switch the the V1, the IPS panel has a warmer tint whereas the V1 is much brighter. Though color values do vary across switches. The joycons themselves are more of a matte finish on the coating rather than the glossy feel on previous joycons. The colors match well with the dock and will definitely stand out by your TV. The dock itself is a bit wider compared to the V1 allowing more wiggle room to prevent the switch from being scratched, though I do recommend purchasing a glass screen protector. The pattern on the back of the switch definitely gives it an ""animal crossing"" feel to showcasing. They did a really good job in making the pattern stand out compared to previous special edition switches.Overall, pretty happy with having a new switch that stands out and has a longer battery life. Will definitely be a well-used switch in the coming months.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"March 16, 2020",K.M.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHJFMU4G53XQFNFQYRLU73JAKWFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

The battery life is nice and the motion controls are alright but I tend not to use them.  I was confused about where to put my micro sd card till I looked it up. It's hidden under the kickstand which is kind of flimsy and the only real con when compared to the list of pros.

For about a week she really enjoyed it and raved about the special look of the Animal crossing edition. She played it for hours at a time and would regularly send me pictures of her progress in AC. After about a week she noticed some issues with the “B” button and after looking into the issue, confirmed the problem. The “B” button would glitch and would sporadically auto click as if it was smash down (no it wasn’t sticky).  Will be returning it after I can save her progress on a SD card.

2142,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,Nintendo coming back to greatness,"For quite some time Nintendo has been underwhelming when it comes to hardware specs on consoles. To the point that I switched to buying only the handhelds after the Gamecube. With the jump to an Nvidia GPU, not only does the bar for graphics get bumped up significantly from what Nintendo has released recently, it also allows third-party title developers the ability to bring their fun games to Nintendo for releases.Let's state that this isn't as powerful as the PS4 or Xbox One, but still has very good graphics. Not only that, but being able to undock it and play it like a handheld is an awesome feature. Switch Online, a service needed for online gaming, also includes NES and SNES titles you can play for free (included in the price really). My ONE issue, is that chat is needed through an external app. If this is done so the playing experience online requires less bandwidth in the rooms and therefore is smoother on the servers, than it makes sense. Otherwise, seems a bit annoying to have to need another device for it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"December 2, 2019",Owen,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGZKB2LNNCIGBYTTZZHZSZCNNHDQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

2183,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,GREAT!! I LOVE IT. DO NOT BUY FROM SCALPERS.,"I finally caved and got one (of course at retail price. It’s great so far, I love it. The box came on time and in good condition. Very easy set-up!I’ve never had a console before, so this is my first official one!! I was considering between this and the lite, but I think it’s totally worth it getting this one. I like to have the option to play it on my TV. I also didn’t think the switch screen would be that big but it’s actually a decent size.The controllers are so bright, especially the red. I wasn’t expecting neon pink. I’ve seen videos and pictures of the switch, but it’s nothing compared to seeing it in-person.I was iffy about buying it on Amazon, even if it was from Amazon themselves instead of resellers, but this turned out great.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"August 26, 2020",Em,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEK27A4LPBXDCFP472NCFDFFGS3A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

2188,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,Good portable system for the Nintendo exclusives.,"I got two of these for a couple reasons:1. I wanted to upgrade my niece from her Nintendo DS.2. My niece loves Pokémon and knows I used to play when I was a kid so she raves about all she’s accomplished.3. I wanted to spank her in Pokemon battles accordingly and show her who the original master is.The system is great. I love the portable aspect, and the docking for a console. However, I don’t even use the portability anymore. I don’t like that Nintendo doesn’t have an achievement system like Xbox or Steam. So I’ll only play exclusives on Nintendo. Other games on multiple platforms, I choose something else.I’ll close with the fact that my plan backfired. My niece kicked my ass and now I don’t wanna play.

Had another issue where one time the image wouldn't show on the TV, and all I had to do was unplug everything, plug AC adapter into wall and also directly into switch (not dock), and then unplug and replug everything into TV.  Every piece of tech has its occasional frustrating moments like this but it's been pretty easy to fix anything that comes up by googling solutions.

They said they couldn't pre-order/seemed unwilling to help before it was released months ago when I asked, and all had in-store pickup in locations hundreds of miles away when it finally came out.

The console was brand new and works very well. It didn't take more than a week to arrive. At the end of the day, if you want a Switch and there is nowhere real close by that has them in stock, I'd reccomend it.

2202,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,Great Console for a Busy Life,"When I was little I used to be able to spend all day playing games. Of course as I got older, my amount of free time decreased exponentially. If, like me, you need to balance your job and college life but still want to play games, this console is a really great choice. It's loaded with tons of pick-up-and-play games that are great for quick 30 minute sessions. The handheld mode makes it really accessible and portable, and the new model has a great battery life. My only big complaint is that the controllers when in handheld mode don't always feel securely attached to the sides of the console. There is a small amount of wiggle if you move the console that is not really enough to bog down the experience, but is still noticeable enough to feel sort of cheap. Overall though this is a great console for a busy young adult still trying to find time for their favorite hobby and I highly reccomend it if you're interested.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"December 24, 2019",Amazon Customer,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGROFC6TZIWLMGIIYOPGRHCXTTZA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

The dock is adorable. A refreshing alternative to the standard black. As soon as I took the Switch out of the box I applied a tempered glass screen protector on it.  I was also able to transfer user data and save data over from my old Switch to this new one. Something I wasn’t aware I could do, which was a very nice surprise.

2227,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,Nintendo hit a home run with the Switch.,"The Switch is the console to have. We were very lucky to get one during the worst of the pandemic when they were sold out everywhere. Amazon really came through! Our 8-year old has loved playing Animal Crossing while stuck at home - 12 weeks so far! It's going to be a quiet stay-at-home summer, so I'm glad we have this as a distraction.We also have a Wii U which in many ways is the first generation of the Switch. A lot of ideas that Nintendo tried out on the Wii U went on to be implemented even better on the Switch - such as the handheld game pad. And the games! Mario Kart 8? First on Wii U. Breath of the Wild - Zelda? Also on Wii U.

Definitely worth its original price ($299) and even though the rise in price is disappointing and definitely pricey, I would argue that its also somewhat worth it. Playing on this is a good way to spend lockdown, so I don't regret making this purchase.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"July 21, 2020",Ty,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH7JIJNPG5SYQZX2UJLYS7GC3B4Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

The mobile feature is pretty cool.  No Netflix and extra stuff.  Eshop is simple.  System processes games quickly.  Worst part is the peripheral devices and other things are expensive.  Games don't deflate much in value, and then people buy up the physical copies.  The eShop will help you get those hard to find games.  Nintendo doesn't censor games either.

Comes with everything you need except a carry case (which I would recommend instead of putting in your backpack lose) as well as picking up a good sized Micro SD card. I got like a 200gb one for $30-40 so I will never lose one of the tiny came cartridges.It's light weight and feels a little fragile, but not cheap feeling.

2276,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,Too many mistakes?🤦,Just like the title shows this console has lot of mistakes.First mistake is the charging when you go to charge it that it'll automatically turn on which will ware it down more sooner if not shut down after being plugged in.Second mistake is not able to be put it into airplane mode while operating in TV mode until you put it into handheld mode which makes no sense because it shuts down both the wireless controllers and Amiibo instead of having options to shut off the online function without disconnected everything else at the same time when feeling playing offline in TV mode.Third mistake is the charging dock and this one got me confused because in the front part where screen goes is solid plastic which will scratch the screen which I was aware of from watching YouTube videos and I was smart enough to get a screen protector but yet think that Nintendo would put in some type of foam or padding for that reason by now.If it didn't have any decent games I wouldn't bought it where I'm giving it 3 star review for the games that work on it.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"April 26, 2021",Mr. Game&Grump,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFL32Y2RID7MN3PGCAISHDD4QU4Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

So many are over priced.2) Online play required by Nintendo for a not good service is poor. Especially for things like minecraft.3) Where are any older games. The games that Nintendo has no need to keep out of the store. The old pokemon, Zelda games, or any games really. Like, great you are putting witcher 3 on there...But not Orignal Zelda and Ocherina of time?Physical? Great! Nintendo online and games? Bad. 1 or 2 games does not make the switch worth buying.

2331,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,Disappointing for me.,"On paper this is such a slick device, and combined with great Nintendo titles this was something I was excited for. BUT this system just isn't there yet. Right now I'm dealing with input lag that goes beyond controller or title specific issues. Right from the get go, setting it up (while in portable mode) felt odd. The touch screen and the attached joy-cons felt a bit slow. The input lag was the same speed as my PS4 with my TVs game mode OFF. Not a huge deal for many who will play most casual games, but annoying enough for me that titles like Cuphead and Enter the Gungeon are hindered. I do wonder if the newer portable only version doesn't have these issues, but I'm mainly interested in this as a home console.And it's online component? They still haven't caught up with Xbox Live from the 360 generation. Not a huge problem with Discord around, but still.Lot's of pluses for this system for sure, but this is mainly a message to people to try out the system first and decide for yourself if the input lag is bad enough to ruin your experience. A lot of people are very satisfied and don't even notice. I can see this not being a problem in games like Pokemon, or Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle.

The hubby had it up and going easily and quickly, and it went from box to play time in about 30 minutes. Be prepared to spend about $20 at start up to join Nintendo, and you get a couple packs of games, some looked retro to me. The battery life is amazing, seriously.

2449,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,All hype - little value,"I'm suppose to love the Switch, but I don't.  I think it's a bad deal overall.1) Nintendo Online doesn't offer much compared to the Wii virtual console days.  There's no Metroid games from the GC/Wii/Advance era.  Nearly all the games for the switch look like something from the 90's when flash games were popular. But the games are priced as if they're made out of gold.2) The frame rate on this console is poor. Yeah, some games reach a respectable 30fps, but I'd say most games fall below that.3) The dock is very woobly, it doesn't lock in, and it's very easy to scratch up the screen.4) There is no wired connection out of the box.  Why should I have to buy an adapter for that?  If you play online seriously, you use a wired connection.5) Here's what really bugs me.  There's no web browser on this thing.  No web browser for a mobile device? Are you kidding me?  This also leads to bizarre consequences.  Since there's no reviews on the Nintendo store, you're forced to go to third party sites for reviews... but you can't, because there's no web browser.  LMAO! And I had to create my nintendo account on a PC!  ROFL!Conclusion:I'll stick with the PC, Xbox and Playstation.  If these issues ever get resolved, I'll reconsider.  It's an interesting design, but it's all hype - little value.  $300 is way overboard for this gimmicky soy toy.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"October 31, 2020",Vincent Steel,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE3MKSNYORLOKYHYLTUXS7LKA7ZQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

Not for nothing but nintendo is getting to dollar, offering the worst deals on the switch and with the switch being it’s big hit , still can’t have quality control, the switch should feel as solid as a tank, not cheap when the joy con wiggles right out if the box and nintendos policy for fixing their mistake in my particular right out if the box defect is that they might send you a replacement which might be the plain grey/black instead if the colored joy con that I paid for is imo,a disgusting business practice, way to stand by their flagship product and instantly  turned me into a never by another nintendo product for anyone person.

2711,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,This console is NOT a NORTH AMERICA console,"Seller deliberately did not state that the console was for sale and use in either Korea/Phillipines/Dubia as it turned out after calling Nintendo and giving them the ups code the one I received was meant for the Phillipines. I called the seller Wacky Jacky and told them what was written on the bottom of the box, he then told me to please wait a minute while he got another from his warehouse and proceeded to verify what I said then said he was sorry and that he had no idea and that his distributor assured him it was a US (North America) console. He then said I feel really bad and was going to send me a $100 gift card but what he did was refund $100 of the purchase price thinking that I would then keep the system. I don't know why he thought I would keep the system when I already had my return authorization label printed out and told him I was returning it, never did I say I wanted to keep the system. Am I supposed to believe he didn't know it wasn't a North America console when even now he has edited his listing to let any future buyers know that what he's selling isn't intended to be sold in the US. The seller asked me to please edit my review and rating but I see no reason to change the stars although I did edit this review to include the conversation with him and the fact that he did not add a note to his product description to make buyers aware of the consoles region. BEWARE WHEN YOU ARE BUYING A SYSTEM THAT IT MAY NOT BE INTENDED FOR SALE IN THE US.....

2737,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con,ITS THE NEW MODEL!!!,"It’s great! Bought this to play Pokémon since I waited 3 years for them to release games I had been waiting on. Sold my original switch, this one is the new model with the longer battery life! And it’s definitely noticeable. I have gone entire days (hour are a time usage)  using it and not had to charge it till I got home or went to bed. One issue that still remains is the onboard WiFi on the console is still just as bad as it was in the first original model.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"November 26, 2019",Jake Paske,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG6DQBEG6ECHI5E3EYPUIX4B3LGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,True

I really wanted something I could play bowling, tennis, Mario etc and after finally pulling the trigger I can say 100% I'm in love with the Switch.
