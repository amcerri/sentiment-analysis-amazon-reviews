133,"i was looking to upgrade from my current dual core intel i7 windows laptop and tablet. the 2020 macbook air m1 screen is sharp, the m1 processor performance is similar to intel i7 quad core for most uses . this laptop is fan-less and gets very warm/hot only when constantly exporting very large 5gb+ files - otherwise it runs cool to cold. i edit photos on this laptop and my editing software opens much faster and the edits occur very quickly. the 8gb ram/256 gb ssd combo in this laptop is fast and responsive. the mac os memory management allows 8gb to be more than enough for my projects. the m1 cpu performance and battery life for the macbook air m1 easily exceed those of my dual core i7 windows laptop and tablet. my photo editing software runs faster and is more responsive than on my windows devices. also, the macbook air m1 performance seems the same whether on battery or ac power unlike my windows devices. this laptop is a fantastic entry-level device but hard core gamers and video creators should upgrade to the pro models for the larger/more vibrant screen, richer audio, cooling fans, additional usb-c ports, sd card slot, dual monitor capability, and more ram/ssd options. i purchased this used base model used at a substantial savings over the list price which made it a fantastic value. i would suggest most users get the 512gb or larger internal ssd so you will not need an external ssd for video/music storage. i currently use external ssd drives to store my large files so the small 256gb ssd size in the base model was not an issue. the only possible drawbacks for the macbook air are there are only 2 usb-c data/charging ports so you may need to purchase a dock if you need multiple connection options, (or use older usb accessories), there is no sd card slot, and software apps are still being updated for the m1 cpu. i run microsoft office 365 on my macbook air. i notice that office 365 takes a second or two longer to load but once loaded office 365 runs as fast as it does on windows. i do not use this laptop for gaming, video editing, or to connect multiple monitors so i cannot comment on those uses. i was not expecting this level of performance from an entry-level device. do not get caught up in the hype that this base model can replace the macbook pro models for heavy work loads or professional use - it does not have the heat distribution (fans) to dissipate the heat to prevent thermal throttling under heavy computing or gaming. for most users, just use and enjoy your 2020 macbook air m1!!",5/5,"this laptop is a fantastic entry-level device but hard core gamers and video creators should upgrade to the pro models for the larger/more vibrant screen, richer audio, cooling fans, additional usb-c ports, sd card slot, dual monitor capability, and more ram/ssd options",0.19,['richer']

238,"m1 pro chip is super powerful - photo/video editing, graphic design - this thing just kills it. compared to previous macbook pro, it is a giant leap ahead. these tasks are a main reason to buy the pro version of the macbook. this particularly model is the lower end of the spec you can get for a pro, but it still kicks butt. you can get the pro max chip and bump up the ram to 64gb if you want - and add tons more storage. the 14 inch macbook pro is the perfect size for a balance of portability and power. it can do pretty much everything the 16 inch version does. the display is stunning. just gorgeous. 120hz capability (pro motion) gets rid of blur when scrolling and makes for clearer action when viewing movies. the brightness and black levels on the display are awesome. real hdr viewing - a big difference. you will hear about ""the notch"" at the top of the screen where the camera is. after 10 minutes i do not even notice it. it means nothing for your experience. its just something critics have chosen to harp about. in most apps the notch is no even visible. camera is now a full 1080p and is a big upgrade over previous macbooks. six speaker sound system with new woofers - sounds incredible. music/movies it feels like surround sound. for video conferencing the microphones are studio quality and you can tell - this is great for video conferencing. the keyboard is a dream to type on. very solid like all macbooks, no spongy feel you get with so many other laptops. the apple magic keyboard is the best - as is the track pad. battery life is amazing. i have gone all day on battery without needing to plug in. at best its spec says 17 hours, which is crazy! especially for this spec...but for real world use with a mix of tasks, it will not be 17 hours but i did a 9 hour session yesterday, and still had a ton of battery left. the power efficiency is ground breaking. they have added back the magsafe power plug - which is great! and added back an sd card slot and and an hdmi port - which many of us hated the previous macs that deleted these ports. i wish it had at least one usb-a old style port - but it does not. you get three usb-c thunderbolt 4 ports that you can use with adapters if needed. they got rid of the touch screen bar at the top of the keyboard from previous pro macbooks and put back the regular mechanical keys for the controls. apparently they listened to a lot of users who did not really like the touch pad. the shape and style of this laptop is great. some say the edge of the laptop looks ""sharp"" where your wrists rest. that is bs. i have been typing most of the day and i do not feel any issue with the edge of the laptop at all. very comfy for typing. some haters may try to find reasons to bash this new macbook pro, but i am telling you - from any perspective, all brand bias aside - this is an amazing laptop - the best apple has ever made, hands down. and i would say you will not find a better power laptop anywhere. all that said - this is not a gamers machine. apple is not for hard core gamers. i mean you can play games on it that you get from the app store. i am a hard core gamer and a pc geek - i have a powerful windows pc for gaming. and always will. but for everything else. this macbook is king. i use to for music, for photo and video editing, for productivity. i can plut into a giant monitor if i want a bigger screen - it works great on my 34 inch ips panel. so if you are wondering if this macbook 14 inch pro is the real deal or not - i am here to tell you, its the real deal. i finally upgraded from my 2015 macbook pro because this new one hits so many sweet spots - revolutionary power and battery life, excellent ergonomic design, great sound, stunning display - its the whole package. if you are thinking of getting one - you will not be disappointed. one last comment. i am an old timer windows guy, and i know all the counter arguments for the mac. many wills say this is overpriced compared to a windows laptop with similar spec. first, show me an intel based laptop that can match these new m1 pro chips - you cannot. and aside from that, the mac os is secure and stable - rock solid - and is intuitive with amazing features - like the ability to copy and paste text from a photo! whaaat? and the design/ergonomics/quality of these macbooks is unmatched. so, yes you pay more - but you get more. my last macbook pro lasted me almost 7 years and it still works great. if you want this laptop - get it! it rocks.",5/5,"six speaker sound system with new woofers - sounds incredible | music/movies it feels like surround sound | i finally upgraded from my 2015 macbook pro because this new one hits so many sweet spots - revolutionary power and battery life, excellent ergonomic design, great sound, stunning display - its the whole package",0.44,"['incredible', '', '']"

""performance"" mode (predictably) runs the battery down quickly but this mode is best used when connected to a power outlet. the fans are a little loud under heavy loads, but that is also to be expected in such a slim chassis. the speakers are competent but not stellar. the display has a great refresh rate & good viewing angles. i think the i7-12650h model was the right choice as it still gives you all 6 performance cores compared to the 12700h, you are losing 4 e-cores but as a mostly stationary/occasionally portable gaming system it is not really a loss. the tb4 & multiple usb ports (that do not block each other by being too close) are all usb 3 & up, no usb 2 here. my model has an sk hynix gold p31 ssd (512gb) & i am plenty happy with that performance. i will but putting in a second nvme drive later since the slot on the board is open. keyboard is good, the touchpad has an excellent feel & spacious.",4/5,"the battery life is reasonable for this system; the ""silent"" mode keeps things quiet & cool for non-gaming and non-video/audio production tasks | the speakers are competent but not stellar",0.15,"['for reasonable video', 'but competent']"

672,"i will put this first. i am unsure if the ram or solid state drive is set or if you can upgrade them. i did not try to open or upgrade the item. these are the two things you should research before purchasing this. although with the current specification, i am sure you do not need to do that. this acer laptop overall is an average size laptop and the specification are not bad for what you get. this laptop is relatively thin and not too heavy. it has a decent processor (ryzen 7). the ram is 16 gb which is well beyond the suggested nowadays. it will definitely work for most daily usage as well as design and gaming. that being said, it is not the best in terms of battery life. it really only last about three to four hours at most on a full charge. the fan is a bit loud on heavy usage. it is a standard ac charger which can make it a bit annoying to replace in the future if needed. the power brick is okay but does get hot while charging. you will need it plugged in to really game on this device. upon boot up of the acer laptop, the laptop boots up fairly quick. the setup is pretty straight forward and does not require any driver installation. the bloatware is not too terrible. the laptop also has only a 14 inch screen with the max resolution at 1920 x 1080. the screen has an okay brightness but not the best quality. it still keep the traditional two usb port as well so you do not have to buy an adapter for this laptop while also having the type c (non thunderbolt) port. the laptop can be angled back for better viewing but it cannot be pushed back all the way. the laptop surface where the wrist rest is where i do not like the material. it looks nice with the bright silver but with long term use it will fade over time. the keys are okay, but not the best. i am not a fan of typing on them as it just feels a bit on the cheaper end. the external casing of this surface is very easy to scratch (seems to be an issue with all this material) so i would recommend that you get a laptop case for it. the trackpad runs pretty well, it is sensitive and feels smooth to move across. it also does not look like it will wear down easily which is good. there is a camera that will record at at least 720p. you could put a web cam cover on it. the dual microphone makes for a very clear voice and i have not had any issues with any sound issues. it usually does not pick up too much surrounding noise and focuses more on voice. on laptop, there is a 3.5 port to plug in headphones/microphone. it does have dual band wifi built in and no issues with speed/connection. the laptop itself can last about five to six hours or so on a full charge. depending on how much you have open and how much you utilize the laptop capability, you could actually have less than that. best thing to do is just balance the resource as best you can. the overall charge time depends but it can take up to three to charge the laptop to 100% from what i can tell. it is not too long and the charger does get hot so handle with care. it has a decent boot up being less than fifteen seconds to boot up but the bloatware has to go so i would recommend you uninstall that if possible. the speaker system is pretty loud but they do have a bit of a feedback noise that is a bit annoying but that is okay. the 3060 ti runs great! it is a very powerful card that allows you to game very well on this computer although the screen is only 14 inches. the fan also is a bit loud on high usage (gaming). the processor is an ryzen 7 which is more than enough power for what i need it to do on a daily. in terms of video games, it can play many games at very high quality although you do need to have it plugged in. the processing speed is really fast and it works really well for what i need. there is an hdmi port so you are able to connect this to an external screen. i am unsure if there is a dock that is meant for this laptop. overall this laptop is a a very powerful laptop. you get a smaller screen but the gaming on it is not bad. the acer laptop can run a bit hot and the battery life is not the best. the specification is not bad at 16 gb ram and 512 gb ssd drive. the space is decent for what i need it for but for gaming it will fill up fast. it is good for all around use and can easily be made into a work, gaming, or basic computer with a single monitor connection.",5/5,the dual microphone makes for a very clear voice and i have not had any issues with any sound issues,0.27,['']

1519,"i will put this first. i am unsure if the ram or solid state drive is set or if you can upgrade them. i did not try to open or upgrade the item. these are the two things you should research before purchasing this. although with the current specification, i am sure you do not need to do that. this acer laptop overall is an average size laptop and the specification are not bad for what you get. this laptop is relatively thin and not too heavy. it has a decent processor (ryzen 7). the ram is 16 gb which is well beyond the suggested nowadays. it will definitely work for most daily usage as well as design and gaming. that being said, it is not the best in terms of battery life. it really only last about three to four hours at most on a full charge. the fan is a bit loud on heavy usage. it is a standard ac charger which can make it a bit annoying to replace in the future if needed. the power brick is okay but does get hot while charging. you will need it plugged in to really game on this device. upon boot up of the acer laptop, the laptop boots up fairly quick. the setup is pretty straight forward and does not require any driver installation. the bloatware is not too terrible. the laptop also has only a 14 inch screen with the max resolution at 1920 x 1080. the screen has an okay brightness but not the best quality. it still keep the traditional two usb port as well so you do not have to buy an adapter for this laptop while also having the type c (non thunderbolt) port. the laptop can be angled back for better viewing but it cannot be pushed back all the way. the laptop surface where the wrist rest is where i do not like the material. it looks nice with the bright silver but with long term use it will fade over time. the keys are okay, but not the best. i am not a fan of typing on them as it just feels a bit on the cheaper end. the external casing of this surface is very easy to scratch (seems to be an issue with all this material) so i would recommend that you get a laptop case for it. the trackpad runs pretty well, it is sensitive and feels smooth to move across. it also does not look like it will wear down easily which is good. there is a camera that will record at at least 720p. you could put a web cam cover on it. the dual microphone makes for a very clear voice and i have not had any issues with any sound issues. it usually does not pick up too much surrounding noise and focuses more on voice. on laptop, there is a 3.5 port to plug in headphones/microphone. it does have dual band wifi built in and no issues with speed/connection. the laptop itself can last about five to six hours or so on a full charge. depending on how much you have open and how much you utilize the laptop capability, you could actually have less than that. best thing to do is just balance the resource as best you can. the overall charge time depends but it can take up to three to charge the laptop to 100% from what i can tell. it is not too long and the charger does get hot so handle with care. it has a decent boot up being less than fifteen seconds to boot up but the bloatware has to go so i would recommend you uninstall that if possible. the speaker system is pretty loud but they do have a bit of a feedback noise that is a bit annoying but that is okay. the 3060 ti runs great! it is a very powerful card that allows you to game very well on this computer although the screen is only 14 inches. the fan also is a bit loud on high usage (gaming). the processor is an ryzen 7 which is more than enough power for what i need it to do on a daily. in terms of video games, it can play many games at very high quality although you do need to have it plugged in. the processing speed is really fast and it works really well for what i need. there is an hdmi port so you are able to connect this to an external screen. i am unsure if there is a dock that is meant for this laptop. overall this laptop is a a very powerful laptop. you get a smaller screen but the gaming on it is not bad. the acer laptop can run a bit hot and the battery life is not the best. the specification is not bad at 16 gb ram and 512 gb ssd drive. the space is decent for what i need it for but for gaming it will fill up fast. it is good for all around use and can easily be made into a work, gaming, or basic computer with a single monitor connection.",5/5,the dual microphone makes for a very clear voice and i have not had any issues with any sound issues,0.27,['']

1642,"i was looking to upgrade from my current dual core intel i7 windows laptop and tablet. the 2020 macbook air m1 screen is sharp, the m1 processor performance is similar to intel i7 quad core for most uses . this laptop is fan-less and gets very warm/hot only when constantly exporting very large 5gb+ files - otherwise it runs cool to cold. i edit photos on this laptop and my editing software opens much faster and the edits occur very quickly. the 8gb ram/256 gb ssd combo in this laptop is fast and responsive. the mac os memory management allows 8gb to be more than enough for my projects. the m1 cpu performance and battery life for the macbook air m1 easily exceed those of my dual core i7 windows laptop and tablet. my photo editing software runs faster and is more responsive than on my windows devices. also, the macbook air m1 performance seems the same whether on battery or ac power unlike my windows devices. this laptop is a fantastic entry-level device but hard core gamers and video creators should upgrade to the pro models for the larger/more vibrant screen, richer audio, cooling fans, additional usb-c ports, sd card slot, dual monitor capability, and more ram/ssd options. i purchased this used base model used at a substantial savings over the list price which made it a fantastic value. i would suggest most users get the 512gb or larger internal ssd so you will not need an external ssd for video/music storage. i currently use external ssd drives to store my large files so the small 256gb ssd size in the base model was not an issue. the only possible drawbacks for the macbook air are there are only 2 usb-c data/charging ports so you may need to purchase a dock if you need multiple connection options, (or use older usb accessories), there is no sd card slot, and software apps are still being updated for the m1 cpu. i run microsoft office 365 on my macbook air. i notice that office 365 takes a second or two longer to load but once loaded office 365 runs as fast as it does on windows. i do not use this laptop for gaming, video editing, or to connect multiple monitors so i cannot comment on those uses. i was not expecting this level of performance from an entry-level device. do not get caught up in the hype that this base model can replace the macbook pro models for heavy work loads or professional use - it does not have the heat distribution (fans) to dissipate the heat to prevent thermal throttling under heavy computing or gaming. for most users, just use and enjoy your 2020 macbook air m1!!",5/5,"this laptop is a fantastic entry-level device but hard core gamers and video creators should upgrade to the pro models for the larger/more vibrant screen, richer audio, cooling fans, additional usb-c ports, sd card slot, dual monitor capability, and more ram/ssd options",0.19,['richer']

1743,"i will put this first. i am unsure if the ram or solid state drive is set or if you can upgrade them. i did not try to open or upgrade the item. these are the two things you should research before purchasing this. although with the current specification, i am sure you do not need to do that. this acer laptop overall is an average size laptop and the specification are not bad for what you get. this laptop is relatively thin and not too heavy. it has a decent processor (ryzen 7). the ram is 16 gb which is well beyond the suggested nowadays. it will definitely work for most daily usage as well as design and gaming. that being said, it is not the best in terms of battery life. it really only last about three to four hours at most on a full charge. the fan is a bit loud on heavy usage. it is a standard ac charger which can make it a bit annoying to replace in the future if needed. the power brick is okay but does get hot while charging. you will need it plugged in to really game on this device. upon boot up of the acer laptop, the laptop boots up fairly quick. the setup is pretty straight forward and does not require any driver installation. the bloatware is not too terrible. the laptop also has only a 14 inch screen with the max resolution at 1920 x 1080. the screen has an okay brightness but not the best quality. it still keep the traditional two usb port as well so you do not have to buy an adapter for this laptop while also having the type c (non thunderbolt) port. the laptop can be angled back for better viewing but it cannot be pushed back all the way. the laptop surface where the wrist rest is where i do not like the material. it looks nice with the bright silver but with long term use it will fade over time. the keys are okay, but not the best. i am not a fan of typing on them as it just feels a bit on the cheaper end. the external casing of this surface is very easy to scratch (seems to be an issue with all this material) so i would recommend that you get a laptop case for it. the trackpad runs pretty well, it is sensitive and feels smooth to move across. it also does not look like it will wear down easily which is good. there is a camera that will record at at least 720p. you could put a web cam cover on it. the dual microphone makes for a very clear voice and i have not had any issues with any sound issues. it usually does not pick up too much surrounding noise and focuses more on voice. on laptop, there is a 3.5 port to plug in headphones/microphone. it does have dual band wifi built in and no issues with speed/connection. the laptop itself can last about five to six hours or so on a full charge. depending on how much you have open and how much you utilize the laptop capability, you could actually have less than that. best thing to do is just balance the resource as best you can. the overall charge time depends but it can take up to three to charge the laptop to 100% from what i can tell. it is not too long and the charger does get hot so handle with care. it has a decent boot up being less than fifteen seconds to boot up but the bloatware has to go so i would recommend you uninstall that if possible. the speaker system is pretty loud but they do have a bit of a feedback noise that is a bit annoying but that is okay. the 3060 ti runs great! it is a very powerful card that allows you to game very well on this computer although the screen is only 14 inches. the fan also is a bit loud on high usage (gaming). the processor is an ryzen 7 which is more than enough power for what i need it to do on a daily. in terms of video games, it can play many games at very high quality although you do need to have it plugged in. the processing speed is really fast and it works really well for what i need. there is an hdmi port so you are able to connect this to an external screen. i am unsure if there is a dock that is meant for this laptop. overall this laptop is a a very powerful laptop. you get a smaller screen but the gaming on it is not bad. the acer laptop can run a bit hot and the battery life is not the best. the specification is not bad at 16 gb ram and 512 gb ssd drive. the space is decent for what i need it for but for gaming it will fill up fast. it is good for all around use and can easily be made into a work, gaming, or basic computer with a single monitor connection.",5/5,the dual microphone makes for a very clear voice and i have not had any issues with any sound issues,0.27,['']

1946,"i spent several weeks with this laptop before sitting down to review it. my conclusions are that for the price-point asked for it, which incidentally is less than what it was when it first arrived at my place, it is well worth the money. the graphics card delivers images and a gaming experience as good as machines i have that costs several hundred dollars more than this one. for me this the essential feature of a gaming laptop and this one passes that test with flying colors. my most demanding games performed without glitches, sputtering or any of the other problems that arise from inadequate graphics functionality. speed on gaming and all other activities on this device leave nothing to complain about. the screen here provides crisp, clear images, another plus for demanding gaming in which partly hidden features during play need to be identified and engaged. conversely, however, the sound card could be better. this card can deliver uneven sound-effects when gaming, though it is fine for watching movies or streaming. ram can be upgraded though i see no need to do so at this point. the casing for this device is strong even though this machine is thinner and sleeker than my other gaming laptops, so much so that i would feel comfortable using it in a business setting; something i would not do with my other gaming machines which look too much like they are designed for fun and games rather than a professional environment. this is a very fast and responsive piece of equipment, essential for a good gaming experience and something i would want anyway from any computer. my bottom line is that you get an exceptional bargain with this machine priced at just under $900 as of this writing in late july 2021. i would definitely recommend it for those looking for a good gaming device capable of handling demanding play at a more affordable price.",4/5,"conversely, however, the sound card could be better | this card can deliver uneven sound-effects when gaming, though it is fine for watching movies or streaming",0.28,"['better', 'for fine']"

2024,"i was looking to upgrade from my current dual core intel i7 windows laptop and tablet. the 2020 macbook air m1 screen is sharp, the m1 processor performance is similar to intel i7 quad core for most uses . this laptop is fan-less and gets very warm/hot only when constantly exporting very large 5gb+ files - otherwise it runs cool to cold. i edit photos on this laptop and my editing software opens much faster and the edits occur very quickly. the 8gb ram/256 gb ssd combo in this laptop is fast and responsive. the mac os memory management allows 8gb to be more than enough for my projects. the m1 cpu performance and battery life for the macbook air m1 easily exceed those of my dual core i7 windows laptop and tablet. my photo editing software runs faster and is more responsive than on my windows devices. also, the macbook air m1 performance seems the same whether on battery or ac power unlike my windows devices. this laptop is a fantastic entry-level device but hard core gamers and video creators should upgrade to the pro models for the larger/more vibrant screen, richer audio, cooling fans, additional usb-c ports, sd card slot, dual monitor capability, and more ram/ssd options. i purchased this used base model used at a substantial savings over the list price which made it a fantastic value. i would suggest most users get the 512gb or larger internal ssd so you will not need an external ssd for video/music storage. i currently use external ssd drives to store my large files so the small 256gb ssd size in the base model was not an issue. the only possible drawbacks for the macbook air are there are only 2 usb-c data/charging ports so you may need to purchase a dock if you need multiple connection options, (or use older usb accessories), there is no sd card slot, and software apps are still being updated for the m1 cpu. i run microsoft office 365 on my macbook air. i notice that office 365 takes a second or two longer to load but once loaded office 365 runs as fast as it does on windows. i do not use this laptop for gaming, video editing, or to connect multiple monitors so i cannot comment on those uses. i was not expecting this level of performance from an entry-level device. do not get caught up in the hype that this base model can replace the macbook pro models for heavy work loads or professional use - it does not have the heat distribution (fans) to dissipate the heat to prevent thermal throttling under heavy computing or gaming. for most users, just use and enjoy your 2020 macbook air m1!!",5/5,"this laptop is a fantastic entry-level device but hard core gamers and video creators should upgrade to the pro models for the larger/more vibrant screen, richer audio, cooling fans, additional usb-c ports, sd card slot, dual monitor capability, and more ram/ssd options",0.19,['richer']

3367,"i will put this first. i am unsure if the ram or solid state drive is set or if you can upgrade them. i did not try to open or upgrade the item. these are the two things you should research before purchasing this. although with the current specification, i am sure you do not need to do that. this acer laptop overall is an average size laptop and the specification are not bad for what you get. this laptop is relatively thin and not too heavy. it has a decent processor (ryzen 7). the ram is 16 gb which is well beyond the suggested nowadays. it will definitely work for most daily usage as well as design and gaming. that being said, it is not the best in terms of battery life. it really only last about three to four hours at most on a full charge. the fan is a bit loud on heavy usage. it is a standard ac charger which can make it a bit annoying to replace in the future if needed. the power brick is okay but does get hot while charging. you will need it plugged in to really game on this device. upon boot up of the acer laptop, the laptop boots up fairly quick. the setup is pretty straight forward and does not require any driver installation. the bloatware is not too terrible. the laptop also has only a 14 inch screen with the max resolution at 1920 x 1080. the screen has an okay brightness but not the best quality. it still keep the traditional two usb port as well so you do not have to buy an adapter for this laptop while also having the type c (non thunderbolt) port. the laptop can be angled back for better viewing but it cannot be pushed back all the way. the laptop surface where the wrist rest is where i do not like the material. it looks nice with the bright silver but with long term use it will fade over time. the keys are okay, but not the best. i am not a fan of typing on them as it just feels a bit on the cheaper end. the external casing of this surface is very easy to scratch (seems to be an issue with all this material) so i would recommend that you get a laptop case for it. the trackpad runs pretty well, it is sensitive and feels smooth to move across. it also does not look like it will wear down easily which is good. there is a camera that will record at at least 720p. you could put a web cam cover on it. the dual microphone makes for a very clear voice and i have not had any issues with any sound issues. it usually does not pick up too much surrounding noise and focuses more on voice. on laptop, there is a 3.5 port to plug in headphones/microphone. it does have dual band wifi built in and no issues with speed/connection. the laptop itself can last about five to six hours or so on a full charge. depending on how much you have open and how much you utilize the laptop capability, you could actually have less than that. best thing to do is just balance the resource as best you can. the overall charge time depends but it can take up to three to charge the laptop to 100% from what i can tell. it is not too long and the charger does get hot so handle with care. it has a decent boot up being less than fifteen seconds to boot up but the bloatware has to go so i would recommend you uninstall that if possible. the speaker system is pretty loud but they do have a bit of a feedback noise that is a bit annoying but that is okay. the 3060 ti runs great! it is a very powerful card that allows you to game very well on this computer although the screen is only 14 inches. the fan also is a bit loud on high usage (gaming). the processor is an ryzen 7 which is more than enough power for what i need it to do on a daily. in terms of video games, it can play many games at very high quality although you do need to have it plugged in. the processing speed is really fast and it works really well for what i need. there is an hdmi port so you are able to connect this to an external screen. i am unsure if there is a dock that is meant for this laptop. overall this laptop is a a very powerful laptop. you get a smaller screen but the gaming on it is not bad. the acer laptop can run a bit hot and the battery life is not the best. the specification is not bad at 16 gb ram and 512 gb ssd drive. the space is decent for what i need it for but for gaming it will fill up fast. it is good for all around use and can easily be made into a work, gaming, or basic computer with a single monitor connection.",5/5,the dual microphone makes for a very clear voice and i have not had any issues with any sound issues,0.27,['']

3442,"this does not have touch screen on my model. the fhd display really surprised me. it is better picture than a lot of these tvs. as with all products they hide the defects from you until a month later. as soon as the 33th day rolled on i turned on the laptop and discovered sure enough it is got a burnt pixel. no way to fix that without replacing the screen. unless you have 5+ burned out pixels, good luck getting a return or any repairs. hp is still shady in that regard. i fully upgraded the machine when i got it. 16gb ram, 1tb samsung 980 ssd. the performance actually is comparable to my tower in many respects. i have a geforce 980, an octocore amd cpu, and 24gb ddr3 ram in my tower. this laptop of course has a little less ram, but it plays games about just as well as on my tower. i really am surprised at this. the cooling situation is absolutely garbage with this laptop. the engineers put the cpu exhaust port pointing directly into the hinge portion of the case. this makes it so the computer is actively fighting by blowing air into a 1/5 cm gap. there is just a row of holes in the bottle for air intake. i picked up a tray with a cooling fan pad and that solved the heat problem. i see it having problems in the future just because of how they designed the fan. the excess heat not only kills your hardware lifespan but it slows your machine down by auto throttling. if i could i would have installed heat spreaders all over the inside of this machine, but there just is not room. they could not even be bothered to make the air inlets in the front of the case. it is asking to burn up after so many years deliberately. i had problems with hp in the past, they screwed up a laptop return i sent in, then blamed me for water damage when i had before and after pictures, so i am not shocked at how they treat customers. i swore i would not buy another hp but this one was just too cheap to pass up. it is super light weight. the camera is nothing fancy, in windows 11, you will find you lack all of your audio enhancement options. it is instead been replaced by this crap hp audio tool. ditch it as soon as you can and find something like pulse audio so you can hear out of the cheap cheap cheap dog szzz cheap speakers. you will also want to get a good set of headphones. the performance is a little low unless you do add that second stick of ram as so many other people have pointed out. the machine simply was not designed properly, and they are taking it out of the consumers pocket by keeping them ignorant and not showing important aspects such as showing how the fan is smack dab in the middle of a 1/2cm gap. when you close the lid and open it after 20 minutes you will find it is incredibly warm if you have it hooked up to hdmi. it forces you to keep the screen open, which is not good to have static screens. i honestly think the burned out pixel happened just from the excess heat, but there is not anything i can do about it. it is not that bad, but once you see something you can never unsee it. i have a warranty but again, it is not going to cover this damage, so i spent money and not even 30 days later it has depreciated in value by the price of the lcd screen. the case is the cheapest plastic they could find. given this was produced during the pandemic you are left with another problem. check your ram speeds. if you get stuck with a 1r16 chip you are basically having 1 librarian trying to organize 16 shelves, whereas the good ram 2r8 would be equal to 2 librarians keeping up with 8 shelves. now you can see how the extra work load slows your machine. they do not mention this in their sales page or documentation, and you will only find out after you get it and run software to look at it, or pull the machine apart. overall, i probably would not buy this machine again, even though it works fast for an entry level computer. it is just too poorly designed. i give it a year or two before it fails. most likely, knowing hp it will be 26 minutes after the oem warranty expires. they used this planned obsolescence to rip off customers, and even though it is been nearly 8 years since i swore i would not buy another one, they changed; for the worse.",4/5,"the camera is nothing fancy, in windows 11, you will find you lack all of your audio enhancement options | it is instead been replaced by this crap hp audio tool | ditch it as soon as you can and find something like pulse audio so you can hear out of the cheap cheap cheap dog szzz cheap speakers",0.16,"['audio', 'audio', '']"

3836,"m1 pro chip is super powerful - photo/video editing, graphic design - this thing just kills it. compared to previous macbook pro, it is a giant leap ahead. these tasks are a main reason to buy the pro version of the macbook. this particularly model is the lower end of the spec you can get for a pro, but it still kicks butt. you can get the pro max chip and bump up the ram to 64gb if you want - and add tons more storage. the 14 inch macbook pro is the perfect size for a balance of portability and power. it can do pretty much everything the 16 inch version does. the display is stunning. just gorgeous. 120hz capability (pro motion) gets rid of blur when scrolling and makes for clearer action when viewing movies. the brightness and black levels on the display are awesome. real hdr viewing - a big difference. you will hear about ""the notch"" at the top of the screen where the camera is. after 10 minutes i do not even notice it. it means nothing for your experience. its just something critics have chosen to harp about. in most apps the notch is no even visible. camera is now a full 1080p and is a big upgrade over previous macbooks. six speaker sound system with new woofers - sounds incredible. music/movies it feels like surround sound. for video conferencing the microphones are studio quality and you can tell - this is great for video conferencing. the keyboard is a dream to type on. very solid like all macbooks, no spongy feel you get with so many other laptops. the apple magic keyboard is the best - as is the track pad. battery life is amazing. i have gone all day on battery without needing to plug in. at best its spec says 17 hours, which is crazy! especially for this spec...but for real world use with a mix of tasks, it will not be 17 hours but i did a 9 hour session yesterday, and still had a ton of battery left. the power efficiency is ground breaking. they have added back the magsafe power plug - which is great! and added back an sd card slot and and an hdmi port - which many of us hated the previous macs that deleted these ports. i wish it had at least one usb-a old style port - but it does not. you get three usb-c thunderbolt 4 ports that you can use with adapters if needed. they got rid of the touch screen bar at the top of the keyboard from previous pro macbooks and put back the regular mechanical keys for the controls. apparently they listened to a lot of users who did not really like the touch pad. the shape and style of this laptop is great. some say the edge of the laptop looks ""sharp"" where your wrists rest. that is bs. i have been typing most of the day and i do not feel any issue with the edge of the laptop at all. very comfy for typing. some haters may try to find reasons to bash this new macbook pro, but i am telling you - from any perspective, all brand bias aside - this is an amazing laptop - the best apple has ever made, hands down. and i would say you will not find a better power laptop anywhere. all that said - this is not a gamers machine. apple is not for hard core gamers. i mean you can play games on it that you get from the app store. i am a hard core gamer and a pc geek - i have a powerful windows pc for gaming. and always will. but for everything else. this macbook is king. i use to for music, for photo and video editing, for productivity. i can plut into a giant monitor if i want a bigger screen - it works great on my 34 inch ips panel. so if you are wondering if this macbook 14 inch pro is the real deal or not - i am here to tell you, its the real deal. i finally upgraded from my 2015 macbook pro because this new one hits so many sweet spots - revolutionary power and battery life, excellent ergonomic design, great sound, stunning display - its the whole package. if you are thinking of getting one - you will not be disappointed. one last comment. i am an old timer windows guy, and i know all the counter arguments for the mac. many wills say this is overpriced compared to a windows laptop with similar spec. first, show me an intel based laptop that can match these new m1 pro chips - you cannot. and aside from that, the mac os is secure and stable - rock solid - and is intuitive with amazing features - like the ability to copy and paste text from a photo! whaaat? and the design/ergonomics/quality of these macbooks is unmatched. so, yes you pay more - but you get more. my last macbook pro lasted me almost 7 years and it still works great. if you want this laptop - get it! it rocks.",5/5,"six speaker sound system with new woofers - sounds incredible | music/movies it feels like surround sound | i finally upgraded from my 2015 macbook pro because this new one hits so many sweet spots - revolutionary power and battery life, excellent ergonomic design, great sound, stunning display - its the whole package",0.44,"['incredible', '', '']"

3994,"m1 pro chip is super powerful - photo/video editing, graphic design - this thing just kills it. compared to previous macbook pro, it is a giant leap ahead. these tasks are a main reason to buy the pro version of the macbook. this particularly model is the lower end of the spec you can get for a pro, but it still kicks butt. you can get the pro max chip and bump up the ram to 64gb if you want - and add tons more storage. the 14 inch macbook pro is the perfect size for a balance of portability and power. it can do pretty much everything the 16 inch version does. the display is stunning. just gorgeous. 120hz capability (pro motion) gets rid of blur when scrolling and makes for clearer action when viewing movies. the brightness and black levels on the display are awesome. real hdr viewing - a big difference. you will hear about ""the notch"" at the top of the screen where the camera is. after 10 minutes i do not even notice it. it means nothing for your experience. its just something critics have chosen to harp about. in most apps the notch is no even visible. camera is now a full 1080p and is a big upgrade over previous macbooks. six speaker sound system with new woofers - sounds incredible. music/movies it feels like surround sound. for video conferencing the microphones are studio quality and you can tell - this is great for video conferencing. the keyboard is a dream to type on. very solid like all macbooks, no spongy feel you get with so many other laptops. the apple magic keyboard is the best - as is the track pad. battery life is amazing. i have gone all day on battery without needing to plug in. at best its spec says 17 hours, which is crazy! especially for this spec...but for real world use with a mix of tasks, it will not be 17 hours but i did a 9 hour session yesterday, and still had a ton of battery left. the power efficiency is ground breaking. they have added back the magsafe power plug - which is great! and added back an sd card slot and and an hdmi port - which many of us hated the previous macs that deleted these ports. i wish it had at least one usb-a old style port - but it does not. you get three usb-c thunderbolt 4 ports that you can use with adapters if needed. they got rid of the touch screen bar at the top of the keyboard from previous pro macbooks and put back the regular mechanical keys for the controls. apparently they listened to a lot of users who did not really like the touch pad. the shape and style of this laptop is great. some say the edge of the laptop looks ""sharp"" where your wrists rest. that is bs. i have been typing most of the day and i do not feel any issue with the edge of the laptop at all. very comfy for typing. some haters may try to find reasons to bash this new macbook pro, but i am telling you - from any perspective, all brand bias aside - this is an amazing laptop - the best apple has ever made, hands down. and i would say you will not find a better power laptop anywhere. all that said - this is not a gamers machine. apple is not for hard core gamers. i mean you can play games on it that you get from the app store. i am a hard core gamer and a pc geek - i have a powerful windows pc for gaming. and always will. but for everything else. this macbook is king. i use to for music, for photo and video editing, for productivity. i can plut into a giant monitor if i want a bigger screen - it works great on my 34 inch ips panel. so if you are wondering if this macbook 14 inch pro is the real deal or not - i am here to tell you, its the real deal. i finally upgraded from my 2015 macbook pro because this new one hits so many sweet spots - revolutionary power and battery life, excellent ergonomic design, great sound, stunning display - its the whole package. if you are thinking of getting one - you will not be disappointed. one last comment. i am an old timer windows guy, and i know all the counter arguments for the mac. many wills say this is overpriced compared to a windows laptop with similar spec. first, show me an intel based laptop that can match these new m1 pro chips - you cannot. and aside from that, the mac os is secure and stable - rock solid - and is intuitive with amazing features - like the ability to copy and paste text from a photo! whaaat? and the design/ergonomics/quality of these macbooks is unmatched. so, yes you pay more - but you get more. my last macbook pro lasted me almost 7 years and it still works great. if you want this laptop - get it! it rocks.",5/5,"six speaker sound system with new woofers - sounds incredible | music/movies it feels like surround sound | i finally upgraded from my 2015 macbook pro because this new one hits so many sweet spots - revolutionary power and battery life, excellent ergonomic design, great sound, stunning display - its the whole package",0.44,"['incredible', '', '']"

4114,"i will put this first. i am unsure if the ram or solid state drive is set or if you can upgrade them. i did not try to open or upgrade the item. these are the two things you should research before purchasing this. although with the current specification, i am sure you do not need to do that. this acer laptop overall is an average size laptop and the specification are not bad for what you get. this laptop is relatively thin and not too heavy. it has a decent processor (ryzen 7). the ram is 16 gb which is well beyond the suggested nowadays. it will definitely work for most daily usage as well as design and gaming. that being said, it is not the best in terms of battery life. it really only last about three to four hours at most on a full charge. the fan is a bit loud on heavy usage. it is a standard ac charger which can make it a bit annoying to replace in the future if needed. the power brick is okay but does get hot while charging. you will need it plugged in to really game on this device. upon boot up of the acer laptop, the laptop boots up fairly quick. the setup is pretty straight forward and does not require any driver installation. the bloatware is not too terrible. the laptop also has only a 14 inch screen with the max resolution at 1920 x 1080. the screen has an okay brightness but not the best quality. it still keep the traditional two usb port as well so you do not have to buy an adapter for this laptop while also having the type c (non thunderbolt) port. the laptop can be angled back for better viewing but it cannot be pushed back all the way. the laptop surface where the wrist rest is where i do not like the material. it looks nice with the bright silver but with long term use it will fade over time. the keys are okay, but not the best. i am not a fan of typing on them as it just feels a bit on the cheaper end. the external casing of this surface is very easy to scratch (seems to be an issue with all this material) so i would recommend that you get a laptop case for it. the trackpad runs pretty well, it is sensitive and feels smooth to move across. it also does not look like it will wear down easily which is good. there is a camera that will record at at least 720p. you could put a web cam cover on it. the dual microphone makes for a very clear voice and i have not had any issues with any sound issues. it usually does not pick up too much surrounding noise and focuses more on voice. on laptop, there is a 3.5 port to plug in headphones/microphone. it does have dual band wifi built in and no issues with speed/connection. the laptop itself can last about five to six hours or so on a full charge. depending on how much you have open and how much you utilize the laptop capability, you could actually have less than that. best thing to do is just balance the resource as best you can. the overall charge time depends but it can take up to three to charge the laptop to 100% from what i can tell. it is not too long and the charger does get hot so handle with care. it has a decent boot up being less than fifteen seconds to boot up but the bloatware has to go so i would recommend you uninstall that if possible. the speaker system is pretty loud but they do have a bit of a feedback noise that is a bit annoying but that is okay. the 3060 ti runs great! it is a very powerful card that allows you to game very well on this computer although the screen is only 14 inches. the fan also is a bit loud on high usage (gaming). the processor is an ryzen 7 which is more than enough power for what i need it to do on a daily. in terms of video games, it can play many games at very high quality although you do need to have it plugged in. the processing speed is really fast and it works really well for what i need. there is an hdmi port so you are able to connect this to an external screen. i am unsure if there is a dock that is meant for this laptop. overall this laptop is a a very powerful laptop. you get a smaller screen but the gaming on it is not bad. the acer laptop can run a bit hot and the battery life is not the best. the specification is not bad at 16 gb ram and 512 gb ssd drive. the space is decent for what i need it for but for gaming it will fill up fast. it is good for all around use and can easily be made into a work, gaming, or basic computer with a single monitor connection.",5/5,the dual microphone makes for a very clear voice and i have not had any issues with any sound issues,0.27,['']

4195,"i will put this first. i am unsure if the ram or solid state drive is set or if you can upgrade them. i did not try to open or upgrade the item. these are the two things you should research before purchasing this. although with the current specification, i am sure you do not need to do that. this acer laptop overall is an average size laptop and the specification are not bad for what you get. this laptop is relatively thin and not too heavy. it has a decent processor (ryzen 7). the ram is 16 gb which is well beyond the suggested nowadays. it will definitely work for most daily usage as well as design and gaming. that being said, it is not the best in terms of battery life. it really only last about three to four hours at most on a full charge. the fan is a bit loud on heavy usage. it is a standard ac charger which can make it a bit annoying to replace in the future if needed. the power brick is okay but does get hot while charging. you will need it plugged in to really game on this device. upon boot up of the acer laptop, the laptop boots up fairly quick. the setup is pretty straight forward and does not require any driver installation. the bloatware is not too terrible. the laptop also has only a 14 inch screen with the max resolution at 1920 x 1080. the screen has an okay brightness but not the best quality. it still keep the traditional two usb port as well so you do not have to buy an adapter for this laptop while also having the type c (non thunderbolt) port. the laptop can be angled back for better viewing but it cannot be pushed back all the way. the laptop surface where the wrist rest is where i do not like the material. it looks nice with the bright silver but with long term use it will fade over time. the keys are okay, but not the best. i am not a fan of typing on them as it just feels a bit on the cheaper end. the external casing of this surface is very easy to scratch (seems to be an issue with all this material) so i would recommend that you get a laptop case for it. the trackpad runs pretty well, it is sensitive and feels smooth to move across. it also does not look like it will wear down easily which is good. there is a camera that will record at at least 720p. you could put a web cam cover on it. the dual microphone makes for a very clear voice and i have not had any issues with any sound issues. it usually does not pick up too much surrounding noise and focuses more on voice. on laptop, there is a 3.5 port to plug in headphones/microphone. it does have dual band wifi built in and no issues with speed/connection. the laptop itself can last about five to six hours or so on a full charge. depending on how much you have open and how much you utilize the laptop capability, you could actually have less than that. best thing to do is just balance the resource as best you can. the overall charge time depends but it can take up to three to charge the laptop to 100% from what i can tell. it is not too long and the charger does get hot so handle with care. it has a decent boot up being less than fifteen seconds to boot up but the bloatware has to go so i would recommend you uninstall that if possible. the speaker system is pretty loud but they do have a bit of a feedback noise that is a bit annoying but that is okay. the 3060 ti runs great! it is a very powerful card that allows you to game very well on this computer although the screen is only 14 inches. the fan also is a bit loud on high usage (gaming). the processor is an ryzen 7 which is more than enough power for what i need it to do on a daily. in terms of video games, it can play many games at very high quality although you do need to have it plugged in. the processing speed is really fast and it works really well for what i need. there is an hdmi port so you are able to connect this to an external screen. i am unsure if there is a dock that is meant for this laptop. overall this laptop is a a very powerful laptop. you get a smaller screen but the gaming on it is not bad. the acer laptop can run a bit hot and the battery life is not the best. the specification is not bad at 16 gb ram and 512 gb ssd drive. the space is decent for what i need it for but for gaming it will fill up fast. it is good for all around use and can easily be made into a work, gaming, or basic computer with a single monitor connection.",5/5,the dual microphone makes for a very clear voice and i have not had any issues with any sound issues,0.27,['']

4427,"m1 pro chip is super powerful - photo/video editing, graphic design - this thing just kills it. compared to previous macbook pro, it is a giant leap ahead. these tasks are a main reason to buy the pro version of the macbook. this particularly model is the lower end of the spec you can get for a pro, but it still kicks butt. you can get the pro max chip and bump up the ram to 64gb if you want - and add tons more storage. the 14 inch macbook pro is the perfect size for a balance of portability and power. it can do pretty much everything the 16 inch version does. the display is stunning. just gorgeous. 120hz capability (pro motion) gets rid of blur when scrolling and makes for clearer action when viewing movies. the brightness and black levels on the display are awesome. real hdr viewing - a big difference. you will hear about ""the notch"" at the top of the screen where the camera is. after 10 minutes i do not even notice it. it means nothing for your experience. its just something critics have chosen to harp about. in most apps the notch is no even visible. camera is now a full 1080p and is a big upgrade over previous macbooks. six speaker sound system with new woofers - sounds incredible. music/movies it feels like surround sound. for video conferencing the microphones are studio quality and you can tell - this is great for video conferencing. the keyboard is a dream to type on. very solid like all macbooks, no spongy feel you get with so many other laptops. the apple magic keyboard is the best - as is the track pad. battery life is amazing. i have gone all day on battery without needing to plug in. at best its spec says 17 hours, which is crazy! especially for this spec...but for real world use with a mix of tasks, it will not be 17 hours but i did a 9 hour session yesterday, and still had a ton of battery left. the power efficiency is ground breaking. they have added back the magsafe power plug - which is great! and added back an sd card slot and and an hdmi port - which many of us hated the previous macs that deleted these ports. i wish it had at least one usb-a old style port - but it does not. you get three usb-c thunderbolt 4 ports that you can use with adapters if needed. they got rid of the touch screen bar at the top of the keyboard from previous pro macbooks and put back the regular mechanical keys for the controls. apparently they listened to a lot of users who did not really like the touch pad. the shape and style of this laptop is great. some say the edge of the laptop looks ""sharp"" where your wrists rest. that is bs. i have been typing most of the day and i do not feel any issue with the edge of the laptop at all. very comfy for typing. some haters may try to find reasons to bash this new macbook pro, but i am telling you - from any perspective, all brand bias aside - this is an amazing laptop - the best apple has ever made, hands down. and i would say you will not find a better power laptop anywhere. all that said - this is not a gamers machine. apple is not for hard core gamers. i mean you can play games on it that you get from the app store. i am a hard core gamer and a pc geek - i have a powerful windows pc for gaming. and always will. but for everything else. this macbook is king. i use to for music, for photo and video editing, for productivity. i can plut into a giant monitor if i want a bigger screen - it works great on my 34 inch ips panel. so if you are wondering if this macbook 14 inch pro is the real deal or not - i am here to tell you, its the real deal. i finally upgraded from my 2015 macbook pro because this new one hits so many sweet spots - revolutionary power and battery life, excellent ergonomic design, great sound, stunning display - its the whole package. if you are thinking of getting one - you will not be disappointed. one last comment. i am an old timer windows guy, and i know all the counter arguments for the mac. many wills say this is overpriced compared to a windows laptop with similar spec. first, show me an intel based laptop that can match these new m1 pro chips - you cannot. and aside from that, the mac os is secure and stable - rock solid - and is intuitive with amazing features - like the ability to copy and paste text from a photo! whaaat? and the design/ergonomics/quality of these macbooks is unmatched. so, yes you pay more - but you get more. my last macbook pro lasted me almost 7 years and it still works great. if you want this laptop - get it! it rocks.",5/5,"six speaker sound system with new woofers - sounds incredible | music/movies it feels like surround sound | i finally upgraded from my 2015 macbook pro because this new one hits so many sweet spots - revolutionary power and battery life, excellent ergonomic design, great sound, stunning display - its the whole package",0.44,"['incredible', '', '']"

4642,"i will put this first. i am unsure if the ram or solid state drive is set or if you can upgrade them. i did not try to open or upgrade the item. these are the two things you should research before purchasing this. although with the current specification, i am sure you do not need to do that. this acer laptop overall is an average size laptop and the specification are not bad for what you get. this laptop is relatively thin and not too heavy. it has a decent processor (ryzen 7). the ram is 16 gb which is well beyond the suggested nowadays. it will definitely work for most daily usage as well as design and gaming. that being said, it is not the best in terms of battery life. it really only last about three to four hours at most on a full charge. the fan is a bit loud on heavy usage. it is a standard ac charger which can make it a bit annoying to replace in the future if needed. the power brick is okay but does get hot while charging. you will need it plugged in to really game on this device. upon boot up of the acer laptop, the laptop boots up fairly quick. the setup is pretty straight forward and does not require any driver installation. the bloatware is not too terrible. the laptop also has only a 14 inch screen with the max resolution at 1920 x 1080. the screen has an okay brightness but not the best quality. it still keep the traditional two usb port as well so you do not have to buy an adapter for this laptop while also having the type c (non thunderbolt) port. the laptop can be angled back for better viewing but it cannot be pushed back all the way. the laptop surface where the wrist rest is where i do not like the material. it looks nice with the bright silver but with long term use it will fade over time. the keys are okay, but not the best. i am not a fan of typing on them as it just feels a bit on the cheaper end. the external casing of this surface is very easy to scratch (seems to be an issue with all this material) so i would recommend that you get a laptop case for it. the trackpad runs pretty well, it is sensitive and feels smooth to move across. it also does not look like it will wear down easily which is good. there is a camera that will record at at least 720p. you could put a web cam cover on it. the dual microphone makes for a very clear voice and i have not had any issues with any sound issues. it usually does not pick up too much surrounding noise and focuses more on voice. on laptop, there is a 3.5 port to plug in headphones/microphone. it does have dual band wifi built in and no issues with speed/connection. the laptop itself can last about five to six hours or so on a full charge. depending on how much you have open and how much you utilize the laptop capability, you could actually have less than that. best thing to do is just balance the resource as best you can. the overall charge time depends but it can take up to three to charge the laptop to 100% from what i can tell. it is not too long and the charger does get hot so handle with care. it has a decent boot up being less than fifteen seconds to boot up but the bloatware has to go so i would recommend you uninstall that if possible. the speaker system is pretty loud but they do have a bit of a feedback noise that is a bit annoying but that is okay. the 3060 ti runs great! it is a very powerful card that allows you to game very well on this computer although the screen is only 14 inches. the fan also is a bit loud on high usage (gaming). the processor is an ryzen 7 which is more than enough power for what i need it to do on a daily. in terms of video games, it can play many games at very high quality although you do need to have it plugged in. the processing speed is really fast and it works really well for what i need. there is an hdmi port so you are able to connect this to an external screen. i am unsure if there is a dock that is meant for this laptop. overall this laptop is a a very powerful laptop. you get a smaller screen but the gaming on it is not bad. the acer laptop can run a bit hot and the battery life is not the best. the specification is not bad at 16 gb ram and 512 gb ssd drive. the space is decent for what i need it for but for gaming it will fill up fast. it is good for all around use and can easily be made into a work, gaming, or basic computer with a single monitor connection.",5/5,the dual microphone makes for a very clear voice and i have not had any issues with any sound issues,0.27,['']

4667,"this does not have touch screen on my model. the fhd display really surprised me. it is better picture than a lot of these tvs. as with all products they hide the defects from you until a month later. as soon as the 33th day rolled on i turned on the laptop and discovered sure enough it is got a burnt pixel. no way to fix that without replacing the screen. unless you have 5+ burned out pixels, good luck getting a return or any repairs. hp is still shady in that regard. i fully upgraded the machine when i got it. 16gb ram, 1tb samsung 980 ssd. the performance actually is comparable to my tower in many respects. i have a geforce 980, an octocore amd cpu, and 24gb ddr3 ram in my tower. this laptop of course has a little less ram, but it plays games about just as well as on my tower. i really am surprised at this. the cooling situation is absolutely garbage with this laptop. the engineers put the cpu exhaust port pointing directly into the hinge portion of the case. this makes it so the computer is actively fighting by blowing air into a 1/5 cm gap. there is just a row of holes in the bottle for air intake. i picked up a tray with a cooling fan pad and that solved the heat problem. i see it having problems in the future just because of how they designed the fan. the excess heat not only kills your hardware lifespan but it slows your machine down by auto throttling. if i could i would have installed heat spreaders all over the inside of this machine, but there just is not room. they could not even be bothered to make the air inlets in the front of the case. it is asking to burn up after so many years deliberately. i had problems with hp in the past, they screwed up a laptop return i sent in, then blamed me for water damage when i had before and after pictures, so i am not shocked at how they treat customers. i swore i would not buy another hp but this one was just too cheap to pass up. it is super light weight. the camera is nothing fancy, in windows 11, you will find you lack all of your audio enhancement options. it is instead been replaced by this crap hp audio tool. ditch it as soon as you can and find something like pulse audio so you can hear out of the cheap cheap cheap dog szzz cheap speakers. you will also want to get a good set of headphones. the performance is a little low unless you do add that second stick of ram as so many other people have pointed out. the machine simply was not designed properly, and they are taking it out of the consumers pocket by keeping them ignorant and not showing important aspects such as showing how the fan is smack dab in the middle of a 1/2cm gap. when you close the lid and open it after 20 minutes you will find it is incredibly warm if you have it hooked up to hdmi. it forces you to keep the screen open, which is not good to have static screens. i honestly think the burned out pixel happened just from the excess heat, but there is not anything i can do about it. it is not that bad, but once you see something you can never unsee it. i have a warranty but again, it is not going to cover this damage, so i spent money and not even 30 days later it has depreciated in value by the price of the lcd screen. the case is the cheapest plastic they could find. given this was produced during the pandemic you are left with another problem. check your ram speeds. if you get stuck with a 1r16 chip you are basically having 1 librarian trying to organize 16 shelves, whereas the good ram 2r8 would be equal to 2 librarians keeping up with 8 shelves. now you can see how the extra work load slows your machine. they do not mention this in their sales page or documentation, and you will only find out after you get it and run software to look at it, or pull the machine apart. overall, i probably would not buy this machine again, even though it works fast for an entry level computer. it is just too poorly designed. i give it a year or two before it fails. most likely, knowing hp it will be 26 minutes after the oem warranty expires. they used this planned obsolescence to rip off customers, and even though it is been nearly 8 years since i swore i would not buy another one, they changed; for the worse.",4/5,"the camera is nothing fancy, in windows 11, you will find you lack all of your audio enhancement options | it is instead been replaced by this crap hp audio tool | ditch it as soon as you can and find something like pulse audio so you can hear out of the cheap cheap cheap dog szzz cheap speakers",0.16,"['audio', 'audio', '']"

4734,"i was looking to upgrade from my current dual core intel i7 windows laptop and tablet. the 2020 macbook air m1 screen is sharp, the m1 processor performance is similar to intel i7 quad core for most uses . this laptop is fan-less and gets very warm/hot only when constantly exporting very large 5gb+ files - otherwise it runs cool to cold. i edit photos on this laptop and my editing software opens much faster and the edits occur very quickly. the 8gb ram/256 gb ssd combo in this laptop is fast and responsive. the mac os memory management allows 8gb to be more than enough for my projects. the m1 cpu performance and battery life for the macbook air m1 easily exceed those of my dual core i7 windows laptop and tablet. my photo editing software runs faster and is more responsive than on my windows devices. also, the macbook air m1 performance seems the same whether on battery or ac power unlike my windows devices. this laptop is a fantastic entry-level device but hard core gamers and video creators should upgrade to the pro models for the larger/more vibrant screen, richer audio, cooling fans, additional usb-c ports, sd card slot, dual monitor capability, and more ram/ssd options. i purchased this used base model used at a substantial savings over the list price which made it a fantastic value. i would suggest most users get the 512gb or larger internal ssd so you will not need an external ssd for video/music storage. i currently use external ssd drives to store my large files so the small 256gb ssd size in the base model was not an issue. the only possible drawbacks for the macbook air are there are only 2 usb-c data/charging ports so you may need to purchase a dock if you need multiple connection options, (or use older usb accessories), there is no sd card slot, and software apps are still being updated for the m1 cpu. i run microsoft office 365 on my macbook air. i notice that office 365 takes a second or two longer to load but once loaded office 365 runs as fast as it does on windows. i do not use this laptop for gaming, video editing, or to connect multiple monitors so i cannot comment on those uses. i was not expecting this level of performance from an entry-level device. do not get caught up in the hype that this base model can replace the macbook pro models for heavy work loads or professional use - it does not have the heat distribution (fans) to dissipate the heat to prevent thermal throttling under heavy computing or gaming. for most users, just use and enjoy your 2020 macbook air m1!!",5/5,"this laptop is a fantastic entry-level device but hard core gamers and video creators should upgrade to the pro models for the larger/more vibrant screen, richer audio, cooling fans, additional usb-c ports, sd card slot, dual monitor capability, and more ram/ssd options",0.19,['richer']

4743,"m1 pro chip is super powerful - photo/video editing, graphic design - this thing just kills it. compared to previous macbook pro, it is a giant leap ahead. these tasks are a main reason to buy the pro version of the macbook. this particularly model is the lower end of the spec you can get for a pro, but it still kicks butt. you can get the pro max chip and bump up the ram to 64gb if you want - and add tons more storage. the 14 inch macbook pro is the perfect size for a balance of portability and power. it can do pretty much everything the 16 inch version does. the display is stunning. just gorgeous. 120hz capability (pro motion) gets rid of blur when scrolling and makes for clearer action when viewing movies. the brightness and black levels on the display are awesome. real hdr viewing - a big difference. you will hear about ""the notch"" at the top of the screen where the camera is. after 10 minutes i do not even notice it. it means nothing for your experience. its just something critics have chosen to harp about. in most apps the notch is no even visible. camera is now a full 1080p and is a big upgrade over previous macbooks. six speaker sound system with new woofers - sounds incredible. music/movies it feels like surround sound. for video conferencing the microphones are studio quality and you can tell - this is great for video conferencing. the keyboard is a dream to type on. very solid like all macbooks, no spongy feel you get with so many other laptops. the apple magic keyboard is the best - as is the track pad. battery life is amazing. i have gone all day on battery without needing to plug in. at best its spec says 17 hours, which is crazy! especially for this spec...but for real world use with a mix of tasks, it will not be 17 hours but i did a 9 hour session yesterday, and still had a ton of battery left. the power efficiency is ground breaking. they have added back the magsafe power plug - which is great! and added back an sd card slot and and an hdmi port - which many of us hated the previous macs that deleted these ports. i wish it had at least one usb-a old style port - but it does not. you get three usb-c thunderbolt 4 ports that you can use with adapters if needed. they got rid of the touch screen bar at the top of the keyboard from previous pro macbooks and put back the regular mechanical keys for the controls. apparently they listened to a lot of users who did not really like the touch pad. the shape and style of this laptop is great. some say the edge of the laptop looks ""sharp"" where your wrists rest. that is bs. i have been typing most of the day and i do not feel any issue with the edge of the laptop at all. very comfy for typing. some haters may try to find reasons to bash this new macbook pro, but i am telling you - from any perspective, all brand bias aside - this is an amazing laptop - the best apple has ever made, hands down. and i would say you will not find a better power laptop anywhere. all that said - this is not a gamers machine. apple is not for hard core gamers. i mean you can play games on it that you get from the app store. i am a hard core gamer and a pc geek - i have a powerful windows pc for gaming. and always will. but for everything else. this macbook is king. i use to for music, for photo and video editing, for productivity. i can plut into a giant monitor if i want a bigger screen - it works great on my 34 inch ips panel. so if you are wondering if this macbook 14 inch pro is the real deal or not - i am here to tell you, its the real deal. i finally upgraded from my 2015 macbook pro because this new one hits so many sweet spots - revolutionary power and battery life, excellent ergonomic design, great sound, stunning display - its the whole package. if you are thinking of getting one - you will not be disappointed. one last comment. i am an old timer windows guy, and i know all the counter arguments for the mac. many wills say this is overpriced compared to a windows laptop with similar spec. first, show me an intel based laptop that can match these new m1 pro chips - you cannot. and aside from that, the mac os is secure and stable - rock solid - and is intuitive with amazing features - like the ability to copy and paste text from a photo! whaaat? and the design/ergonomics/quality of these macbooks is unmatched. so, yes you pay more - but you get more. my last macbook pro lasted me almost 7 years and it still works great. if you want this laptop - get it! it rocks.",5/5,"six speaker sound system with new woofers - sounds incredible | music/movies it feels like surround sound | i finally upgraded from my 2015 macbook pro because this new one hits so many sweet spots - revolutionary power and battery life, excellent ergonomic design, great sound, stunning display - its the whole package",0.44,"['incredible', '', '']"

4901,"m1 pro chip is super powerful - photo/video editing, graphic design - this thing just kills it. compared to previous macbook pro, it is a giant leap ahead. these tasks are a main reason to buy the pro version of the macbook. this particularly model is the lower end of the spec you can get for a pro, but it still kicks butt. you can get the pro max chip and bump up the ram to 64gb if you want - and add tons more storage. the 14 inch macbook pro is the perfect size for a balance of portability and power. it can do pretty much everything the 16 inch version does. the display is stunning. just gorgeous. 120hz capability (pro motion) gets rid of blur when scrolling and makes for clearer action when viewing movies. the brightness and black levels on the display are awesome. real hdr viewing - a big difference. you will hear about ""the notch"" at the top of the screen where the camera is. after 10 minutes i do not even notice it. it means nothing for your experience. its just something critics have chosen to harp about. in most apps the notch is no even visible. camera is now a full 1080p and is a big upgrade over previous macbooks. six speaker sound system with new woofers - sounds incredible. music/movies it feels like surround sound. for video conferencing the microphones are studio quality and you can tell - this is great for video conferencing. the keyboard is a dream to type on. very solid like all macbooks, no spongy feel you get with so many other laptops. the apple magic keyboard is the best - as is the track pad. battery life is amazing. i have gone all day on battery without needing to plug in. at best its spec says 17 hours, which is crazy! especially for this spec...but for real world use with a mix of tasks, it will not be 17 hours but i did a 9 hour session yesterday, and still had a ton of battery left. the power efficiency is ground breaking. they have added back the magsafe power plug - which is great! and added back an sd card slot and and an hdmi port - which many of us hated the previous macs that deleted these ports. i wish it had at least one usb-a old style port - but it does not. you get three usb-c thunderbolt 4 ports that you can use with adapters if needed. they got rid of the touch screen bar at the top of the keyboard from previous pro macbooks and put back the regular mechanical keys for the controls. apparently they listened to a lot of users who did not really like the touch pad. the shape and style of this laptop is great. some say the edge of the laptop looks ""sharp"" where your wrists rest. that is bs. i have been typing most of the day and i do not feel any issue with the edge of the laptop at all. very comfy for typing. some haters may try to find reasons to bash this new macbook pro, but i am telling you - from any perspective, all brand bias aside - this is an amazing laptop - the best apple has ever made, hands down. and i would say you will not find a better power laptop anywhere. all that said - this is not a gamers machine. apple is not for hard core gamers. i mean you can play games on it that you get from the app store. i am a hard core gamer and a pc geek - i have a powerful windows pc for gaming. and always will. but for everything else. this macbook is king. i use to for music, for photo and video editing, for productivity. i can plut into a giant monitor if i want a bigger screen - it works great on my 34 inch ips panel. so if you are wondering if this macbook 14 inch pro is the real deal or not - i am here to tell you, its the real deal. i finally upgraded from my 2015 macbook pro because this new one hits so many sweet spots - revolutionary power and battery life, excellent ergonomic design, great sound, stunning display - its the whole package. if you are thinking of getting one - you will not be disappointed. one last comment. i am an old timer windows guy, and i know all the counter arguments for the mac. many wills say this is overpriced compared to a windows laptop with similar spec. first, show me an intel based laptop that can match these new m1 pro chips - you cannot. and aside from that, the mac os is secure and stable - rock solid - and is intuitive with amazing features - like the ability to copy and paste text from a photo! whaaat? and the design/ergonomics/quality of these macbooks is unmatched. so, yes you pay more - but you get more. my last macbook pro lasted me almost 7 years and it still works great. if you want this laptop - get it! it rocks.",5/5,"six speaker sound system with new woofers - sounds incredible | music/movies it feels like surround sound | i finally upgraded from my 2015 macbook pro because this new one hits so many sweet spots - revolutionary power and battery life, excellent ergonomic design, great sound, stunning display - its the whole package",0.44,"['incredible', '', '']"

4997,"i will put this first. i am unsure if the ram or solid state drive is set or if you can upgrade them. i did not try to open or upgrade the item. these are the two things you should research before purchasing this. although with the current specification, i am sure you do not need to do that. this acer laptop overall is an average size laptop and the specification are not bad for what you get. this laptop is relatively thin and not too heavy. it has a decent processor (ryzen 7). the ram is 16 gb which is well beyond the suggested nowadays. it will definitely work for most daily usage as well as design and gaming. that being said, it is not the best in terms of battery life. it really only last about three to four hours at most on a full charge. the fan is a bit loud on heavy usage. it is a standard ac charger which can make it a bit annoying to replace in the future if needed. the power brick is okay but does get hot while charging. you will need it plugged in to really game on this device. upon boot up of the acer laptop, the laptop boots up fairly quick. the setup is pretty straight forward and does not require any driver installation. the bloatware is not too terrible. the laptop also has only a 14 inch screen with the max resolution at 1920 x 1080. the screen has an okay brightness but not the best quality. it still keep the traditional two usb port as well so you do not have to buy an adapter for this laptop while also having the type c (non thunderbolt) port. the laptop can be angled back for better viewing but it cannot be pushed back all the way. the laptop surface where the wrist rest is where i do not like the material. it looks nice with the bright silver but with long term use it will fade over time. the keys are okay, but not the best. i am not a fan of typing on them as it just feels a bit on the cheaper end. the external casing of this surface is very easy to scratch (seems to be an issue with all this material) so i would recommend that you get a laptop case for it. the trackpad runs pretty well, it is sensitive and feels smooth to move across. it also does not look like it will wear down easily which is good. there is a camera that will record at at least 720p. you could put a web cam cover on it. the dual microphone makes for a very clear voice and i have not had any issues with any sound issues. it usually does not pick up too much surrounding noise and focuses more on voice. on laptop, there is a 3.5 port to plug in headphones/microphone. it does have dual band wifi built in and no issues with speed/connection. the laptop itself can last about five to six hours or so on a full charge. depending on how much you have open and how much you utilize the laptop capability, you could actually have less than that. best thing to do is just balance the resource as best you can. the overall charge time depends but it can take up to three to charge the laptop to 100% from what i can tell. it is not too long and the charger does get hot so handle with care. it has a decent boot up being less than fifteen seconds to boot up but the bloatware has to go so i would recommend you uninstall that if possible. the speaker system is pretty loud but they do have a bit of a feedback noise that is a bit annoying but that is okay. the 3060 ti runs great! it is a very powerful card that allows you to game very well on this computer although the screen is only 14 inches. the fan also is a bit loud on high usage (gaming). the processor is an ryzen 7 which is more than enough power for what i need it to do on a daily. in terms of video games, it can play many games at very high quality although you do need to have it plugged in. the processing speed is really fast and it works really well for what i need. there is an hdmi port so you are able to connect this to an external screen. i am unsure if there is a dock that is meant for this laptop. overall this laptop is a a very powerful laptop. you get a smaller screen but the gaming on it is not bad. the acer laptop can run a bit hot and the battery life is not the best. the specification is not bad at 16 gb ram and 512 gb ssd drive. the space is decent for what i need it for but for gaming it will fill up fast. it is good for all around use and can easily be made into a work, gaming, or basic computer with a single monitor connection.",5/5,the dual microphone makes for a very clear voice and i have not had any issues with any sound issues,0.27,['']

5224,"i will put this first. i am unsure if the ram or solid state drive is set or if you can upgrade them. i did not try to open or upgrade the item. these are the two things you should research before purchasing this. although with the current specification, i am sure you do not need to do that. this acer laptop overall is an average size laptop and the specification are not bad for what you get. this laptop is relatively thin and not too heavy. it has a decent processor (ryzen 7). the ram is 16 gb which is well beyond the suggested nowadays. it will definitely work for most daily usage as well as design and gaming. that being said, it is not the best in terms of battery life. it really only last about three to four hours at most on a full charge. the fan is a bit loud on heavy usage. it is a standard ac charger which can make it a bit annoying to replace in the future if needed. the power brick is okay but does get hot while charging. you will need it plugged in to really game on this device. upon boot up of the acer laptop, the laptop boots up fairly quick. the setup is pretty straight forward and does not require any driver installation. the bloatware is not too terrible. the laptop also has only a 14 inch screen with the max resolution at 1920 x 1080. the screen has an okay brightness but not the best quality. it still keep the traditional two usb port as well so you do not have to buy an adapter for this laptop while also having the type c (non thunderbolt) port. the laptop can be angled back for better viewing but it cannot be pushed back all the way. the laptop surface where the wrist rest is where i do not like the material. it looks nice with the bright silver but with long term use it will fade over time. the keys are okay, but not the best. i am not a fan of typing on them as it just feels a bit on the cheaper end. the external casing of this surface is very easy to scratch (seems to be an issue with all this material) so i would recommend that you get a laptop case for it. the trackpad runs pretty well, it is sensitive and feels smooth to move across. it also does not look like it will wear down easily which is good. there is a camera that will record at at least 720p. you could put a web cam cover on it. the dual microphone makes for a very clear voice and i have not had any issues with any sound issues. it usually does not pick up too much surrounding noise and focuses more on voice. on laptop, there is a 3.5 port to plug in headphones/microphone. it does have dual band wifi built in and no issues with speed/connection. the laptop itself can last about five to six hours or so on a full charge. depending on how much you have open and how much you utilize the laptop capability, you could actually have less than that. best thing to do is just balance the resource as best you can. the overall charge time depends but it can take up to three to charge the laptop to 100% from what i can tell. it is not too long and the charger does get hot so handle with care. it has a decent boot up being less than fifteen seconds to boot up but the bloatware has to go so i would recommend you uninstall that if possible. the speaker system is pretty loud but they do have a bit of a feedback noise that is a bit annoying but that is okay. the 3060 ti runs great! it is a very powerful card that allows you to game very well on this computer although the screen is only 14 inches. the fan also is a bit loud on high usage (gaming). the processor is an ryzen 7 which is more than enough power for what i need it to do on a daily. in terms of video games, it can play many games at very high quality although you do need to have it plugged in. the processing speed is really fast and it works really well for what i need. there is an hdmi port so you are able to connect this to an external screen. i am unsure if there is a dock that is meant for this laptop. overall this laptop is a a very powerful laptop. you get a smaller screen but the gaming on it is not bad. the acer laptop can run a bit hot and the battery life is not the best. the specification is not bad at 16 gb ram and 512 gb ssd drive. the space is decent for what i need it for but for gaming it will fill up fast. it is good for all around use and can easily be made into a work, gaming, or basic computer with a single monitor connection.",5/5,the dual microphone makes for a very clear voice and i have not had any issues with any sound issues,0.27,['']
5244,"this does not have touch screen on my model. the fhd display really surprised me. it is better picture than a lot of these tvs. as with all products they hide the defects from you until a month later. as soon as the 33th day rolled on i turned on the laptop and discovered sure enough it is got a burnt pixel. no way to fix that without replacing the screen. unless you have 5+ burned out pixels, good luck getting a return or any repairs. hp is still shady in that regard. i fully upgraded the machine when i got it. 16gb ram, 1tb samsung 980 ssd. the performance actually is comparable to my tower in many respects. i have a geforce 980, an octocore amd cpu, and 24gb ddr3 ram in my tower. this laptop of course has a little less ram, but it plays games about just as well as on my tower. i really am surprised at this. the cooling situation is absolutely garbage with this laptop. the engineers put the cpu exhaust port pointing directly into the hinge portion of the case. this makes it so the computer is actively fighting by blowing air into a 1/5 cm gap. there is just a row of holes in the bottle for air intake. i picked up a tray with a cooling fan pad and that solved the heat problem. i see it having problems in the future just because of how they designed the fan. the excess heat not only kills your hardware lifespan but it slows your machine down by auto throttling. if i could i would have installed heat spreaders all over the inside of this machine, but there just is not room. they could not even be bothered to make the air inlets in the front of the case. it is asking to burn up after so many years deliberately. i had problems with hp in the past, they screwed up a laptop return i sent in, then blamed me for water damage when i had before and after pictures, so i am not shocked at how they treat customers. i swore i would not buy another hp but this one was just too cheap to pass up. it is super light weight. the camera is nothing fancy, in windows 11, you will find you lack all of your audio enhancement options. it is instead been replaced by this crap hp audio tool. ditch it as soon as you can and find something like pulse audio so you can hear out of the cheap cheap cheap dog szzz cheap speakers. you will also want to get a good set of headphones. the performance is a little low unless you do add that second stick of ram as so many other people have pointed out. the machine simply was not designed properly, and they are taking it out of the consumers pocket by keeping them ignorant and not showing important aspects such as showing how the fan is smack dab in the middle of a 1/2cm gap. when you close the lid and open it after 20 minutes you will find it is incredibly warm if you have it hooked up to hdmi. it forces you to keep the screen open, which is not good to have static screens. i honestly think the burned out pixel happened just from the excess heat, but there is not anything i can do about it. it is not that bad, but once you see something you can never unsee it. i have a warranty but again, it is not going to cover this damage, so i spent money and not even 30 days later it has depreciated in value by the price of the lcd screen. the case is the cheapest plastic they could find. given this was produced during the pandemic you are left with another problem. check your ram speeds. if you get stuck with a 1r16 chip you are basically having 1 librarian trying to organize 16 shelves, whereas the good ram 2r8 would be equal to 2 librarians keeping up with 8 shelves. now you can see how the extra work load slows your machine. they do not mention this in their sales page or documentation, and you will only find out after you get it and run software to look at it, or pull the machine apart. overall, i probably would not buy this machine again, even though it works fast for an entry level computer. it is just too poorly designed. i give it a year or two before it fails. most likely, knowing hp it will be 26 minutes after the oem warranty expires. they used this planned obsolescence to rip off customers, and even though it is been nearly 8 years since i swore i would not buy another one, they changed; for the worse.",4/5,"the camera is nothing fancy, in windows 11, you will find you lack all of your audio enhancement options | it is instead been replaced by this crap hp audio tool | ditch it as soon as you can and find something like pulse audio so you can hear out of the cheap cheap cheap dog szzz cheap speakers",0.16,"['audio', 'audio', '']"

5428,"i spent several weeks with this laptop before sitting down to review it. my conclusions are that for the price-point asked for it, which incidentally is less than what it was when it first arrived at my place, it is well worth the money. the graphics card delivers images and a gaming experience as good as machines i have that costs several hundred dollars more than this one. for me this the essential feature of a gaming laptop and this one passes that test with flying colors. my most demanding games performed without glitches, sputtering or any of the other problems that arise from inadequate graphics functionality. speed on gaming and all other activities on this device leave nothing to complain about. the screen here provides crisp, clear images, another plus for demanding gaming in which partly hidden features during play need to be identified and engaged. conversely, however, the sound card could be better. this card can deliver uneven sound-effects when gaming, though it is fine for watching movies or streaming. ram can be upgraded though i see no need to do so at this point. the casing for this device is strong even though this machine is thinner and sleeker than my other gaming laptops, so much so that i would feel comfortable using it in a business setting; something i would not do with my other gaming machines which look too much like they are designed for fun and games rather than a professional environment. this is a very fast and responsive piece of equipment, essential for a good gaming experience and something i would want anyway from any computer. my bottom line is that you get an exceptional bargain with this machine priced at just under $900 as of this writing in late july 2021. i would definitely recommend it for those looking for a good gaming device capable of handling demanding play at a more affordable price.",4/5,"conversely, however, the sound card could be better | this card can deliver uneven sound-effects when gaming, though it is fine for watching movies or streaming",0.28,"['better', 'for fine']"

5439,"i will put this first. i am unsure if the ram or solid state drive is set or if you can upgrade them. i did not try to open or upgrade the item. these are the two things you should research before purchasing this. although with the current specification, i am sure you do not need to do that. this acer laptop overall is an average size laptop and the specification are not bad for what you get. this laptop is relatively thin and not too heavy. it has a decent processor (ryzen 7). the ram is 16 gb which is well beyond the suggested nowadays. it will definitely work for most daily usage as well as design and gaming. that being said, it is not the best in terms of battery life. it really only last about three to four hours at most on a full charge. the fan is a bit loud on heavy usage. it is a standard ac charger which can make it a bit annoying to replace in the future if needed. the power brick is okay but does get hot while charging. you will need it plugged in to really game on this device. upon boot up of the acer laptop, the laptop boots up fairly quick. the setup is pretty straight forward and does not require any driver installation. the bloatware is not too terrible. the laptop also has only a 14 inch screen with the max resolution at 1920 x 1080. the screen has an okay brightness but not the best quality. it still keep the traditional two usb port as well so you do not have to buy an adapter for this laptop while also having the type c (non thunderbolt) port. the laptop can be angled back for better viewing but it cannot be pushed back all the way. the laptop surface where the wrist rest is where i do not like the material. it looks nice with the bright silver but with long term use it will fade over time. the keys are okay, but not the best. i am not a fan of typing on them as it just feels a bit on the cheaper end. the external casing of this surface is very easy to scratch (seems to be an issue with all this material) so i would recommend that you get a laptop case for it. the trackpad runs pretty well, it is sensitive and feels smooth to move across. it also does not look like it will wear down easily which is good. there is a camera that will record at at least 720p. you could put a web cam cover on it. the dual microphone makes for a very clear voice and i have not had any issues with any sound issues. it usually does not pick up too much surrounding noise and focuses more on voice. on laptop, there is a 3.5 port to plug in headphones/microphone. it does have dual band wifi built in and no issues with speed/connection. the laptop itself can last about five to six hours or so on a full charge. depending on how much you have open and how much you utilize the laptop capability, you could actually have less than that. best thing to do is just balance the resource as best you can. the overall charge time depends but it can take up to three to charge the laptop to 100% from what i can tell. it is not too long and the charger does get hot so handle with care. it has a decent boot up being less than fifteen seconds to boot up but the bloatware has to go so i would recommend you uninstall that if possible. the speaker system is pretty loud but they do have a bit of a feedback noise that is a bit annoying but that is okay. the 3060 ti runs great! it is a very powerful card that allows you to game very well on this computer although the screen is only 14 inches. the fan also is a bit loud on high usage (gaming). the processor is an ryzen 7 which is more than enough power for what i need it to do on a daily. in terms of video games, it can play many games at very high quality although you do need to have it plugged in. the processing speed is really fast and it works really well for what i need. there is an hdmi port so you are able to connect this to an external screen. i am unsure if there is a dock that is meant for this laptop. overall this laptop is a a very powerful laptop. you get a smaller screen but the gaming on it is not bad. the acer laptop can run a bit hot and the battery life is not the best. the specification is not bad at 16 gb ram and 512 gb ssd drive. the space is decent for what i need it for but for gaming it will fill up fast. it is good for all around use and can easily be made into a work, gaming, or basic computer with a single monitor connection.",5/5,the dual microphone makes for a very clear voice and i have not had any issues with any sound issues,0.27,['']

5539,"this does not have touch screen on my model. the fhd display really surprised me. it is better picture than a lot of these tvs. as with all products they hide the defects from you until a month later. as soon as the 33th day rolled on i turned on the laptop and discovered sure enough it is got a burnt pixel. no way to fix that without replacing the screen. unless you have 5+ burned out pixels, good luck getting a return or any repairs. hp is still shady in that regard. i fully upgraded the machine when i got it. 16gb ram, 1tb samsung 980 ssd. the performance actually is comparable to my tower in many respects. i have a geforce 980, an octocore amd cpu, and 24gb ddr3 ram in my tower. this laptop of course has a little less ram, but it plays games about just as well as on my tower. i really am surprised at this. the cooling situation is absolutely garbage with this laptop. the engineers put the cpu exhaust port pointing directly into the hinge portion of the case. this makes it so the computer is actively fighting by blowing air into a 1/5 cm gap. there is just a row of holes in the bottle for air intake. i picked up a tray with a cooling fan pad and that solved the heat problem. i see it having problems in the future just because of how they designed the fan. the excess heat not only kills your hardware lifespan but it slows your machine down by auto throttling. if i could i would have installed heat spreaders all over the inside of this machine, but there just is not room. they could not even be bothered to make the air inlets in the front of the case. it is asking to burn up after so many years deliberately. i had problems with hp in the past, they screwed up a laptop return i sent in, then blamed me for water damage when i had before and after pictures, so i am not shocked at how they treat customers. i swore i would not buy another hp but this one was just too cheap to pass up. it is super light weight. the camera is nothing fancy, in windows 11, you will find you lack all of your audio enhancement options. it is instead been replaced by this crap hp audio tool. ditch it as soon as you can and find something like pulse audio so you can hear out of the cheap cheap cheap dog szzz cheap speakers. you will also want to get a good set of headphones. the performance is a little low unless you do add that second stick of ram as so many other people have pointed out. the machine simply was not designed properly, and they are taking it out of the consumers pocket by keeping them ignorant and not showing important aspects such as showing how the fan is smack dab in the middle of a 1/2cm gap. when you close the lid and open it after 20 minutes you will find it is incredibly warm if you have it hooked up to hdmi. it forces you to keep the screen open, which is not good to have static screens. i honestly think the burned out pixel happened just from the excess heat, but there is not anything i can do about it. it is not that bad, but once you see something you can never unsee it. i have a warranty but again, it is not going to cover this damage, so i spent money and not even 30 days later it has depreciated in value by the price of the lcd screen. the case is the cheapest plastic they could find. given this was produced during the pandemic you are left with another problem. check your ram speeds. if you get stuck with a 1r16 chip you are basically having 1 librarian trying to organize 16 shelves, whereas the good ram 2r8 would be equal to 2 librarians keeping up with 8 shelves. now you can see how the extra work load slows your machine. they do not mention this in their sales page or documentation, and you will only find out after you get it and run software to look at it, or pull the machine apart. overall, i probably would not buy this machine again, even though it works fast for an entry level computer. it is just too poorly designed. i give it a year or two before it fails. most likely, knowing hp it will be 26 minutes after the oem warranty expires. they used this planned obsolescence to rip off customers, and even though it is been nearly 8 years since i swore i would not buy another one, they changed; for the worse.",4/5,"the camera is nothing fancy, in windows 11, you will find you lack all of your audio enhancement options | it is instead been replaced by this crap hp audio tool | ditch it as soon as you can and find something like pulse audio so you can hear out of the cheap cheap cheap dog szzz cheap speakers",0.16,"['audio', 'audio', '']"

5594,"m1 pro chip is super powerful - photo/video editing, graphic design - this thing just kills it. compared to previous macbook pro, it is a giant leap ahead. these tasks are a main reason to buy the pro version of the macbook. this particularly model is the lower end of the spec you can get for a pro, but it still kicks butt. you can get the pro max chip and bump up the ram to 64gb if you want - and add tons more storage. the 14 inch macbook pro is the perfect size for a balance of portability and power. it can do pretty much everything the 16 inch version does. the display is stunning. just gorgeous. 120hz capability (pro motion) gets rid of blur when scrolling and makes for clearer action when viewing movies. the brightness and black levels on the display are awesome. real hdr viewing - a big difference. you will hear about ""the notch"" at the top of the screen where the camera is. after 10 minutes i do not even notice it. it means nothing for your experience. its just something critics have chosen to harp about. in most apps the notch is no even visible. camera is now a full 1080p and is a big upgrade over previous macbooks. six speaker sound system with new woofers - sounds incredible. music/movies it feels like surround sound. for video conferencing the microphones are studio quality and you can tell - this is great for video conferencing. the keyboard is a dream to type on. very solid like all macbooks, no spongy feel you get with so many other laptops. the apple magic keyboard is the best - as is the track pad. battery life is amazing. i have gone all day on battery without needing to plug in. at best its spec says 17 hours, which is crazy! especially for this spec...but for real world use with a mix of tasks, it will not be 17 hours but i did a 9 hour session yesterday, and still had a ton of battery left. the power efficiency is ground breaking. they have added back the magsafe power plug - which is great! and added back an sd card slot and and an hdmi port - which many of us hated the previous macs that deleted these ports. i wish it had at least one usb-a old style port - but it does not. you get three usb-c thunderbolt 4 ports that you can use with adapters if needed. they got rid of the touch screen bar at the top of the keyboard from previous pro macbooks and put back the regular mechanical keys for the controls. apparently they listened to a lot of users who did not really like the touch pad. the shape and style of this laptop is great. some say the edge of the laptop looks ""sharp"" where your wrists rest. that is bs. i have been typing most of the day and i do not feel any issue with the edge of the laptop at all. very comfy for typing. some haters may try to find reasons to bash this new macbook pro, but i am telling you - from any perspective, all brand bias aside - this is an amazing laptop - the best apple has ever made, hands down. and i would say you will not find a better power laptop anywhere. all that said - this is not a gamers machine. apple is not for hard core gamers. i mean you can play games on it that you get from the app store. i am a hard core gamer and a pc geek - i have a powerful windows pc for gaming. and always will. but for everything else. this macbook is king. i use to for music, for photo and video editing, for productivity. i can plut into a giant monitor if i want a bigger screen - it works great on my 34 inch ips panel. so if you are wondering if this macbook 14 inch pro is the real deal or not - i am here to tell you, its the real deal. i finally upgraded from my 2015 macbook pro because this new one hits so many sweet spots - revolutionary power and battery life, excellent ergonomic design, great sound, stunning display - its the whole package. if you are thinking of getting one - you will not be disappointed. one last comment. i am an old timer windows guy, and i know all the counter arguments for the mac. many wills say this is overpriced compared to a windows laptop with similar spec. first, show me an intel based laptop that can match these new m1 pro chips - you cannot. and aside from that, the mac os is secure and stable - rock solid - and is intuitive with amazing features - like the ability to copy and paste text from a photo! whaaat? and the design/ergonomics/quality of these macbooks is unmatched. so, yes you pay more - but you get more. my last macbook pro lasted me almost 7 years and it still works great. if you want this laptop - get it! it rocks.",5/5,"six speaker sound system with new woofers - sounds incredible | music/movies it feels like surround sound | i finally upgraded from my 2015 macbook pro because this new one hits so many sweet spots - revolutionary power and battery life, excellent ergonomic design, great sound, stunning display - its the whole package",0.44,"['incredible', '', '']"

5693,"this does not have touch screen on my model. the fhd display really surprised me. it is better picture than a lot of these tvs. as with all products they hide the defects from you until a month later. as soon as the 33th day rolled on i turned on the laptop and discovered sure enough it is got a burnt pixel. no way to fix that without replacing the screen. unless you have 5+ burned out pixels, good luck getting a return or any repairs. hp is still shady in that regard. i fully upgraded the machine when i got it. 16gb ram, 1tb samsung 980 ssd. the performance actually is comparable to my tower in many respects. i have a geforce 980, an octocore amd cpu, and 24gb ddr3 ram in my tower. this laptop of course has a little less ram, but it plays games about just as well as on my tower. i really am surprised at this. the cooling situation is absolutely garbage with this laptop. the engineers put the cpu exhaust port pointing directly into the hinge portion of the case. this makes it so the computer is actively fighting by blowing air into a 1/5 cm gap. there is just a row of holes in the bottle for air intake. i picked up a tray with a cooling fan pad and that solved the heat problem. i see it having problems in the future just because of how they designed the fan. the excess heat not only kills your hardware lifespan but it slows your machine down by auto throttling. if i could i would have installed heat spreaders all over the inside of this machine, but there just is not room. they could not even be bothered to make the air inlets in the front of the case. it is asking to burn up after so many years deliberately. i had problems with hp in the past, they screwed up a laptop return i sent in, then blamed me for water damage when i had before and after pictures, so i am not shocked at how they treat customers. i swore i would not buy another hp but this one was just too cheap to pass up. it is super light weight. the camera is nothing fancy, in windows 11, you will find you lack all of your audio enhancement options. it is instead been replaced by this crap hp audio tool. ditch it as soon as you can and find something like pulse audio so you can hear out of the cheap cheap cheap dog szzz cheap speakers. you will also want to get a good set of headphones. the performance is a little low unless you do add that second stick of ram as so many other people have pointed out. the machine simply was not designed properly, and they are taking it out of the consumers pocket by keeping them ignorant and not showing important aspects such as showing how the fan is smack dab in the middle of a 1/2cm gap. when you close the lid and open it after 20 minutes you will find it is incredibly warm if you have it hooked up to hdmi. it forces you to keep the screen open, which is not good to have static screens. i honestly think the burned out pixel happened just from the excess heat, but there is not anything i can do about it. it is not that bad, but once you see something you can never unsee it. i have a warranty but again, it is not going to cover this damage, so i spent money and not even 30 days later it has depreciated in value by the price of the lcd screen. the case is the cheapest plastic they could find. given this was produced during the pandemic you are left with another problem. check your ram speeds. if you get stuck with a 1r16 chip you are basically having 1 librarian trying to organize 16 shelves, whereas the good ram 2r8 would be equal to 2 librarians keeping up with 8 shelves. now you can see how the extra work load slows your machine. they do not mention this in their sales page or documentation, and you will only find out after you get it and run software to look at it, or pull the machine apart. overall, i probably would not buy this machine again, even though it works fast for an entry level computer. it is just too poorly designed. i give it a year or two before it fails. most likely, knowing hp it will be 26 minutes after the oem warranty expires. they used this planned obsolescence to rip off customers, and even though it is been nearly 8 years since i swore i would not buy another one, they changed; for the worse.",4/5,"the camera is nothing fancy, in windows 11, you will find you lack all of your audio enhancement options | it is instead been replaced by this crap hp audio tool | ditch it as soon as you can and find something like pulse audio so you can hear out of the cheap cheap cheap dog szzz cheap speakers",0.16,"['audio', 'audio', '']"

5918,"m1 pro chip is super powerful - photo/video editing, graphic design - this thing just kills it. compared to previous macbook pro, it is a giant leap ahead. these tasks are a main reason to buy the pro version of the macbook. this particularly model is the lower end of the spec you can get for a pro, but it still kicks butt. you can get the pro max chip and bump up the ram to 64gb if you want - and add tons more storage. the 14 inch macbook pro is the perfect size for a balance of portability and power. it can do pretty much everything the 16 inch version does. the display is stunning. just gorgeous. 120hz capability (pro motion) gets rid of blur when scrolling and makes for clearer action when viewing movies. the brightness and black levels on the display are awesome. real hdr viewing - a big difference. you will hear about ""the notch"" at the top of the screen where the camera is. after 10 minutes i do not even notice it. it means nothing for your experience. its just something critics have chosen to harp about. in most apps the notch is no even visible. camera is now a full 1080p and is a big upgrade over previous macbooks. six speaker sound system with new woofers - sounds incredible. music/movies it feels like surround sound. for video conferencing the microphones are studio quality and you can tell - this is great for video conferencing. the keyboard is a dream to type on. very solid like all macbooks, no spongy feel you get with so many other laptops. the apple magic keyboard is the best - as is the track pad. battery life is amazing. i have gone all day on battery without needing to plug in. at best its spec says 17 hours, which is crazy! especially for this spec...but for real world use with a mix of tasks, it will not be 17 hours but i did a 9 hour session yesterday, and still had a ton of battery left. the power efficiency is ground breaking. they have added back the magsafe power plug - which is great! and added back an sd card slot and and an hdmi port - which many of us hated the previous macs that deleted these ports. i wish it had at least one usb-a old style port - but it does not. you get three usb-c thunderbolt 4 ports that you can use with adapters if needed. they got rid of the touch screen bar at the top of the keyboard from previous pro macbooks and put back the regular mechanical keys for the controls. apparently they listened to a lot of users who did not really like the touch pad. the shape and style of this laptop is great. some say the edge of the laptop looks ""sharp"" where your wrists rest. that is bs. i have been typing most of the day and i do not feel any issue with the edge of the laptop at all. very comfy for typing. some haters may try to find reasons to bash this new macbook pro, but i am telling you - from any perspective, all brand bias aside - this is an amazing laptop - the best apple has ever made, hands down. and i would say you will not find a better power laptop anywhere. all that said - this is not a gamers machine. apple is not for hard core gamers. i mean you can play games on it that you get from the app store. i am a hard core gamer and a pc geek - i have a powerful windows pc for gaming. and always will. but for everything else. this macbook is king. i use to for music, for photo and video editing, for productivity. i can plut into a giant monitor if i want a bigger screen - it works great on my 34 inch ips panel. so if you are wondering if this macbook 14 inch pro is the real deal or not - i am here to tell you, its the real deal. i finally upgraded from my 2015 macbook pro because this new one hits so many sweet spots - revolutionary power and battery life, excellent ergonomic design, great sound, stunning display - its the whole package. if you are thinking of getting one - you will not be disappointed. one last comment. i am an old timer windows guy, and i know all the counter arguments for the mac. many wills say this is overpriced compared to a windows laptop with similar spec. first, show me an intel based laptop that can match these new m1 pro chips - you cannot. and aside from that, the mac os is secure and stable - rock solid - and is intuitive with amazing features - like the ability to copy and paste text from a photo! whaaat? and the design/ergonomics/quality of these macbooks is unmatched. so, yes you pay more - but you get more. my last macbook pro lasted me almost 7 years and it still works great. if you want this laptop - get it! it rocks.",5/5,"six speaker sound system with new woofers - sounds incredible | music/movies it feels like surround sound | i finally upgraded from my 2015 macbook pro because this new one hits so many sweet spots - revolutionary power and battery life, excellent ergonomic design, great sound, stunning display - its the whole package",0.44,"['incredible', '', '']"

6583,"i will put this first. i am unsure if the ram or solid state drive is set or if you can upgrade them. i did not try to open or upgrade the item. these are the two things you should research before purchasing this. although with the current specification, i am sure you do not need to do that. this acer laptop overall is an average size laptop and the specification are not bad for what you get. this laptop is relatively thin and not too heavy. it has a decent processor (ryzen 7). the ram is 16 gb which is well beyond the suggested nowadays. it will definitely work for most daily usage as well as design and gaming. that being said, it is not the best in terms of battery life. it really only last about three to four hours at most on a full charge. the fan is a bit loud on heavy usage. it is a standard ac charger which can make it a bit annoying to replace in the future if needed. the power brick is okay but does get hot while charging. you will need it plugged in to really game on this device. upon boot up of the acer laptop, the laptop boots up fairly quick. the setup is pretty straight forward and does not require any driver installation. the bloatware is not too terrible. the laptop also has only a 14 inch screen with the max resolution at 1920 x 1080. the screen has an okay brightness but not the best quality. it still keep the traditional two usb port as well so you do not have to buy an adapter for this laptop while also having the type c (non thunderbolt) port. the laptop can be angled back for better viewing but it cannot be pushed back all the way. the laptop surface where the wrist rest is where i do not like the material. it looks nice with the bright silver but with long term use it will fade over time. the keys are okay, but not the best. i am not a fan of typing on them as it just feels a bit on the cheaper end. the external casing of this surface is very easy to scratch (seems to be an issue with all this material) so i would recommend that you get a laptop case for it. the trackpad runs pretty well, it is sensitive and feels smooth to move across. it also does not look like it will wear down easily which is good. there is a camera that will record at at least 720p. you could put a web cam cover on it. the dual microphone makes for a very clear voice and i have not had any issues with any sound issues. it usually does not pick up too much surrounding noise and focuses more on voice. on laptop, there is a 3.5 port to plug in headphones/microphone. it does have dual band wifi built in and no issues with speed/connection. the laptop itself can last about five to six hours or so on a full charge. depending on how much you have open and how much you utilize the laptop capability, you could actually have less than that. best thing to do is just balance the resource as best you can. the overall charge time depends but it can take up to three to charge the laptop to 100% from what i can tell. it is not too long and the charger does get hot so handle with care. it has a decent boot up being less than fifteen seconds to boot up but the bloatware has to go so i would recommend you uninstall that if possible. the speaker system is pretty loud but they do have a bit of a feedback noise that is a bit annoying but that is okay. the 3060 ti runs great! it is a very powerful card that allows you to game very well on this computer although the screen is only 14 inches. the fan also is a bit loud on high usage (gaming). the processor is an ryzen 7 which is more than enough power for what i need it to do on a daily. in terms of video games, it can play many games at very high quality although you do need to have it plugged in. the processing speed is really fast and it works really well for what i need. there is an hdmi port so you are able to connect this to an external screen. i am unsure if there is a dock that is meant for this laptop. overall this laptop is a a very powerful laptop. you get a smaller screen but the gaming on it is not bad. the acer laptop can run a bit hot and the battery life is not the best. the specification is not bad at 16 gb ram and 512 gb ssd drive. the space is decent for what i need it for but for gaming it will fill up fast. it is good for all around use and can easily be made into a work, gaming, or basic computer with a single monitor connection.",5/5,the dual microphone makes for a very clear voice and i have not had any issues with any sound issues,0.27,['']

6794,"my twin daughters have gone through over a half dozen chromebooks over the last 3 years. they can be brutal on them, so i blame their behavior more than i blame the chromebooks. we have had hp, asus, and others. this is our first lenovo. i am impressed with the no-flex chassis, overall build quality, and by far this is the best keyboard of their chromebooks. great key travel and key texture and overall look. the setup was a breeze, about 3 minutes. we merely logged into my daughter's google account and put in the wifi password. that is it. it is a plug-and-play with 2-watt speakers, clear screen, great portability, and all offered at an attractive price point. so far, i can give this lenovo a strong recommendation.",5/5,"it is a plug-and-play with 2-watt speakers, clear screen, great portability, and all offered at an attractive price point",0.57,['']

6948,"i will put this first. i am unsure if the ram or solid state drive is set or if you can upgrade them. i did not try to open or upgrade the item. these are the two things you should research before purchasing this. although with the current specification, i am sure you do not need to do that. this acer laptop overall is an average size laptop and the specification are not bad for what you get. this laptop is relatively thin and not too heavy. it has a decent processor (ryzen 7). the ram is 16 gb which is well beyond the suggested nowadays. it will definitely work for most daily usage as well as design and gaming. that being said, it is not the best in terms of battery life. it really only last about three to four hours at most on a full charge. the fan is a bit loud on heavy usage. it is a standard ac charger which can make it a bit annoying to replace in the future if needed. the power brick is okay but does get hot while charging. you will need it plugged in to really game on this device. upon boot up of the acer laptop, the laptop boots up fairly quick. the setup is pretty straight forward and does not require any driver installation. the bloatware is not too terrible. the laptop also has only a 14 inch screen with the max resolution at 1920 x 1080. the screen has an okay brightness but not the best quality. it still keep the traditional two usb port as well so you do not have to buy an adapter for this laptop while also having the type c (non thunderbolt) port. the laptop can be angled back for better viewing but it cannot be pushed back all the way. the laptop surface where the wrist rest is where i do not like the material. it looks nice with the bright silver but with long term use it will fade over time. the keys are okay, but not the best. i am not a fan of typing on them as it just feels a bit on the cheaper end. the external casing of this surface is very easy to scratch (seems to be an issue with all this material) so i would recommend that you get a laptop case for it. the trackpad runs pretty well, it is sensitive and feels smooth to move across. it also does not look like it will wear down easily which is good. there is a camera that will record at at least 720p. you could put a web cam cover on it. the dual microphone makes for a very clear voice and i have not had any issues with any sound issues. it usually does not pick up too much surrounding noise and focuses more on voice. on laptop, there is a 3.5 port to plug in headphones/microphone. it does have dual band wifi built in and no issues with speed/connection. the laptop itself can last about five to six hours or so on a full charge. depending on how much you have open and how much you utilize the laptop capability, you could actually have less than that. best thing to do is just balance the resource as best you can. the overall charge time depends but it can take up to three to charge the laptop to 100% from what i can tell. it is not too long and the charger does get hot so handle with care. it has a decent boot up being less than fifteen seconds to boot up but the bloatware has to go so i would recommend you uninstall that if possible. the speaker system is pretty loud but they do have a bit of a feedback noise that is a bit annoying but that is okay. the 3060 ti runs great! it is a very powerful card that allows you to game very well on this computer although the screen is only 14 inches. the fan also is a bit loud on high usage (gaming). the processor is an ryzen 7 which is more than enough power for what i need it to do on a daily. in terms of video games, it can play many games at very high quality although you do need to have it plugged in. the processing speed is really fast and it works really well for what i need. there is an hdmi port so you are able to connect this to an external screen. i am unsure if there is a dock that is meant for this laptop. overall this laptop is a a very powerful laptop. you get a smaller screen but the gaming on it is not bad. the acer laptop can run a bit hot and the battery life is not the best. the specification is not bad at 16 gb ram and 512 gb ssd drive. the space is decent for what i need it for but for gaming it will fill up fast. it is good for all around use and can easily be made into a work, gaming, or basic computer with a single monitor connection.",5/5,the dual microphone makes for a very clear voice and i have not had any issues with any sound issues,0.27,['']
