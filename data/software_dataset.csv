19,"i absolutely love my new macbook. when it arrived i answered a few questions, connected it to my wifi and off i went. it has been a buttery smooth experience. keyboards are one of those things that are dependent on user preferences, but for me it is the best feeling keyboard i have ever owned. many professional reviewers agree it is terrific. the multi-touch pad is brilliant, and now that i know the many different combinations of fingers and movements i zip around getting work done. for example a two-finger swipe right goes back to the previous web page, no need to hit that back button. it is also custom configurable to your touchpad needs. what i appreciate most is the total cost of ownership value. i bought final cut pro x when it came out 10 years ago yet there was no charge to get the latest version downloaded from the app store. it does everything i need without an ongoing subscription fee like others have. i still cannot get used to how fast it works, it took me an hour to render a video on my old mac but this macbook did it in just a few minutes. and it is cool and quiet! i am using a huge 70"" 4k monitor as my secondary monitor. battery life is ridiculous. i plug it in every 2 or 3 days depending on my workload, which is several hours per day. i think the web camera is fine for me and many notebooks use this same 720p size. i join one zoom conference per week, so it does not really matter. the one thing i hope gets updated with the next release are the ports. i am using a hub because it only has two thunderbolt ports. i recommend this notebook to all my friends and family.",5/5,"keyboards are one of those things that are dependent on user preferences, but for me it is the best feeling keyboard i have ever owned | what i appreciate most is the total cost of ownership value",0.5,"['on dependent', '']"
23,"the new macbook air with the m1 chip is overall amazing! it is definitely worth the money! the all-new chipset has turned the air lineup into a beast! my only complaint is the camera. apple has stuck to the same 720p camera and claiming the neural engine makes it better? i am not convinced it is any better, and it is really a disappointment compared to other notebooks in its class. also, the inability to adjust the keyboard brightness from the keyboard. it is adjustable from the settings and easily accessible… but it is just an inconvenience. it is a petty complaint but for the money, this should be standard (it previously was on older models). aside from that, this notebook is amazing! lightning fast and the best battery life i have ever seen! overall, if you are in the apple ecosystem and you are looking for an amazing laptop with all day battery life - this is the one for you!",5/5,"aside from that, this notebook is amazing! lightning fast and the best battery life i have ever seen! overall, if you are in the apple ecosystem and you are looking for an amazing laptop with all day battery life - this is the one for you!",0.54,['amazing']

29,"i have both an ipad and iphone so i thought is would be make sense to have a mac so everything is in one ecosystem, as it were. to some extent this has indeed proved true and useful. i am coming from a surface pro 7. the mac air's battery life is much less than advertised. the claim is around 10 hours, i doubt i get 5, and i am mostly doing internet browsing and word stuff. battery life from fully charged was about 1 hour while on zoom. the battery life of the surface is better. word for mac is a little different than word for a pc, but the differences are minor and manageable. but documents open more slowly on the mac, and mine has the m1 chip. on the surface, documents usually open immediately. on the mac it might take 5 seconds, not an eternity, but a little annoying. the surface boots up much faster than the mac. i have a dvd with a number of workouts on it. i could not get any individual workouts to open using the mac's native software. so i downloaded vlc. it works fine on the mac, but takes a long time to open, about a minute. this seems to be true of any software not downloaded from the app store, including firefox. there do not appear to be mac apps for either. on the other hand, the mac has a better screen than the surface. while the surface is quite a good laptop, it is a marginal tablet, and i almost never use it as a tablet. when i am not sitting at a desk, i prefer the mac because the two parts cannot come apart as can happen on a surface. the new mac keyboard works great, maybe a tie with the surface. so a mixed bag. as i mentioned, i like having everything in one ecosystem, so likely that is enough of a benefit to keep the mac. i am mulling over upgrading to the macbook pro 13 because of its bigger battery, but do not know if i want to spend the extra money.",4/5,"i have both an ipad and iphone so i thought is would be make sense to have a mac so everything is in one ecosystem, as it were | the claim is around 10 hours, i doubt i get 5, and i am mostly doing internet browsing and word stuff | i could not get any individual workouts to open using the mac's native software | this seems to be true of any software not downloaded from the app store, including firefox | while the surface is quite a good laptop, it is a marginal tablet, and i almost never use it as a tablet | as i mentioned, i like having everything in one ecosystem, so likely that is enough of a benefit to keep the mac",0.22,"['', '', 'native', 'of true', '', '']"

33,"i love this laptop. it replaced an acer aspire 5 slim, which was quite heavy, and had a battery that lasted five hours. in power saver mode. it was only two years old and rarely used until i started a new job and school. i had my macbook going from 8:30 am to 8:30 pm pretty much consistently, and it still had 55% battery life. because i have an iphone, i can make calls and send texts with it. my ipad can be used for sidecar, which is basically wireless screen mirroring, allowing me to have a portable second monitor. the mac does not skip a beat- i can leave it closed overnight, and everything is exactly the same the next morning without crashing or reloading. it is not at all heavy, and the size is exactly what a laptop should be. the mac os not supporting steam titles thing is not a huge deal- if i want a gaming machine, i have a desktop. for getting things done, this is an absolutely perfect daily driver, and i would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone. my one gripe is lack of usb-a ports, but i will buy an adapter and move on with my life. overall, try a macbook air… you will like it.",5/5,"the mac does not skip a beat- i can leave it closed overnight, and everything is exactly the same the next morning without crashing or reloading | the mac os not supporting steam titles thing is not a huge deal- if i want a gaming machine, i have a desktop",-0.03,"['', '']"

42,so for the most part i use this for when i am traveling or out and about for my business. i find it the right size for the job i am doing and take advantage of apples cloud storage and ways of using other mac's as storage for information so this does not use storage much at all. where this is nice is the quick user functionality it has in access these documents or programs needed seamlessly and being able to help keep my business moving on the road. most of the time i am using browser programs to access the business info or using the cloud to access files back at the home base which is the new mac mini with an external hard drive that houses the business information. i find that the size makes a great traveling companion for onsite work. when connecting to a shared internet connection it is nice knowing that the channel is mostly secure and when using my iphone shares cell connection and new chips they can help create a safe network for my means of work. if you are debating getting one for business i recommend using their cloud storage so you eliminate the focus on storage anxiety and makes it more worth it in the long run of having a user interface focused laptop. also the battery for most of the work i am doing lasts me a week with heavy workload 4 days max. honestly you cannot get too much better for a long lasting apple hardware focused product.,5/5,so for the most part i use this for when i am traveling or out and about for my business | where this is nice is the quick user functionality it has in access these documents or programs needed seamlessly and being able to help keep my business moving on the road | most of the time i am using browser programs to access the business info or using the cloud to access files back at the home base which is the new mac mini with an external hard drive that houses the business information | when connecting to a shared internet connection it is nice knowing that the channel is mostly secure and when using my iphone shares cell connection and new chips they can help create a safe network for my means of work | also the battery for most of the work i am doing lasts me a week with heavy workload 4 days max,0.21,"['', 'help nice able', '', 'mostly nice secure', '']"

238,"m1 pro chip is super powerful - photo/video editing, graphic design - this thing just kills it. compared to previous macbook pro, it is a giant leap ahead. these tasks are a main reason to buy the pro version of the macbook. this particularly model is the lower end of the spec you can get for a pro, but it still kicks butt. you can get the pro max chip and bump up the ram to 64gb if you want - and add tons more storage. the 14 inch macbook pro is the perfect size for a balance of portability and power. it can do pretty much everything the 16 inch version does. the display is stunning. just gorgeous. 120hz capability (pro motion) gets rid of blur when scrolling and makes for clearer action when viewing movies. the brightness and black levels on the display are awesome. real hdr viewing - a big difference. you will hear about ""the notch"" at the top of the screen where the camera is. after 10 minutes i do not even notice it. it means nothing for your experience. its just something critics have chosen to harp about. in most apps the notch is no even visible. camera is now a full 1080p and is a big upgrade over previous macbooks. six speaker sound system with new woofers - sounds incredible. music/movies it feels like surround sound. for video conferencing the microphones are studio quality and you can tell - this is great for video conferencing. the keyboard is a dream to type on. very solid like all macbooks, no spongy feel you get with so many other laptops. the apple magic keyboard is the best - as is the track pad. battery life is amazing. i have gone all day on battery without needing to plug in. at best its spec says 17 hours, which is crazy! especially for this spec...but for real world use with a mix of tasks, it will not be 17 hours but i did a 9 hour session yesterday, and still had a ton of battery left. the power efficiency is ground breaking. they have added back the magsafe power plug - which is great! and added back an sd card slot and and an hdmi port - which many of us hated the previous macs that deleted these ports. i wish it had at least one usb-a old style port - but it does not. you get three usb-c thunderbolt 4 ports that you can use with adapters if needed. they got rid of the touch screen bar at the top of the keyboard from previous pro macbooks and put back the regular mechanical keys for the controls. apparently they listened to a lot of users who did not really like the touch pad. the shape and style of this laptop is great. some say the edge of the laptop looks ""sharp"" where your wrists rest. that is bs. i have been typing most of the day and i do not feel any issue with the edge of the laptop at all. very comfy for typing. some haters may try to find reasons to bash this new macbook pro, but i am telling you - from any perspective, all brand bias aside - this is an amazing laptop - the best apple has ever made, hands down. and i would say you will not find a better power laptop anywhere. all that said - this is not a gamers machine. apple is not for hard core gamers. i mean you can play games on it that you get from the app store. i am a hard core gamer and a pc geek - i have a powerful windows pc for gaming. and always will. but for everything else. this macbook is king. i use to for music, for photo and video editing, for productivity. i can plut into a giant monitor if i want a bigger screen - it works great on my 34 inch ips panel. so if you are wondering if this macbook 14 inch pro is the real deal or not - i am here to tell you, its the real deal. i finally upgraded from my 2015 macbook pro because this new one hits so many sweet spots - revolutionary power and battery life, excellent ergonomic design, great sound, stunning display - its the whole package. if you are thinking of getting one - you will not be disappointed. one last comment. i am an old timer windows guy, and i know all the counter arguments for the mac. many wills say this is overpriced compared to a windows laptop with similar spec. first, show me an intel based laptop that can match these new m1 pro chips - you cannot. and aside from that, the mac os is secure and stable - rock solid - and is intuitive with amazing features - like the ability to copy and paste text from a photo! whaaat?

672,"i will put this first. i am unsure if the ram or solid state drive is set or if you can upgrade them. i did not try to open or upgrade the item. these are the two things you should research before purchasing this. although with the current specification, i am sure you do not need to do that. this acer laptop overall is an average size laptop and the specification are not bad for what you get. this laptop is relatively thin and not too heavy. it has a decent processor (ryzen 7). the ram is 16 gb which is well beyond the suggested nowadays. it will definitely work for most daily usage as well as design and gaming. that being said, it is not the best in terms of battery life. it really only last about three to four hours at most on a full charge. the fan is a bit loud on heavy usage. it is a standard ac charger which can make it a bit annoying to replace in the future if needed. the power brick is okay but does get hot while charging. you will need it plugged in to really game on this device. upon boot up of the acer laptop, the laptop boots up fairly quick. the setup is pretty straight forward and does not require any driver installation. the bloatware is not too terrible. the laptop also has only a 14 inch screen with the max resolution at 1920 x 1080. the screen has an okay brightness but not the best quality. it still keep the traditional two usb port as well so you do not have to buy an adapter for this laptop while also having the type c (non thunderbolt) port. the laptop can be angled back for better viewing but it cannot be pushed back all the way. the laptop surface where the wrist rest is where i do not like the material. it looks nice with the bright silver but with long term use it will fade over time. the keys are okay, but not the best. i am not a fan of typing on them as it just feels a bit on the cheaper end. the external casing of this surface is very easy to scratch (seems to be an issue with all this material) so i would recommend that you get a laptop case for it. the trackpad runs pretty well, it is sensitive and feels smooth to move across. it also does not look like it will wear down easily which is good. there is a camera that will record at at least 720p. you could put a web cam cover on it. the dual microphone makes for a very clear voice and i have not had any issues with any sound issues. it usually does not pick up too much surrounding noise and focuses more on voice. on laptop, there is a 3.5 port to plug in headphones/microphone. it does have dual band wifi built in and no issues with speed/connection. the laptop itself can last about five to six hours or so on a full charge. depending on how much you have open and how much you utilize the laptop capability, you could actually have less than that. best thing to do is just balance the resource as best you can. the overall charge time depends but it can take up to three to charge the laptop to 100% from what i can tell. it is not too long and the charger does get hot so handle with care. it has a decent boot up being less than fifteen seconds to boot up but the bloatware has to go so i would recommend you uninstall that if possible. the speaker system is pretty loud but they do have a bit of a feedback noise that is a bit annoying but that is okay. the 3060 ti runs great! it is a very powerful card that allows you to game very well on this computer although the screen is only 14 inches. the fan also is a bit loud on high usage (gaming). the processor is an ryzen 7 which is more than enough power for what i need it to do on a daily. in terms of video games, it can play many games at very high quality although you do need to have it plugged in. the processing speed is really fast and it works really well for what i need. there is an hdmi port so you are able to connect this to an external screen. i am unsure if there is a dock that is meant for this laptop. overall this laptop is a a very powerful laptop. you get a smaller screen but the gaming on it is not bad. the acer laptop can run a bit hot and the battery life is not the best. the specification is not bad at 16 gb ram and 512 gb ssd drive. the space is decent for what i need it for but for gaming it will fill up fast. it is good for all around use and can easily be made into a work, gaming, or basic computer with a single monitor connection.",5/5,"it will definitely work for most daily usage as well as design and gaming | it really only last about three to four hours at most on a full charge | the trackpad runs pretty well, it is sensitive and feels smooth to move across | it has a decent boot up being less than fifteen seconds to boot up but the bloatware has to go so i would recommend you uninstall that if possible",0.16,"['', '', 'sensitive smooth', '']"

1125,"this does not have touch screen on my model. the fhd display really surprised me. it is better picture than a lot of these tvs. as with all products they hide the defects from you until a month later. as soon as the 33th day rolled on i turned on the laptop and discovered sure enough it is got a burnt pixel. no way to fix that without replacing the screen. unless you have 5+ burned out pixels, good luck getting a return or any repairs. hp is still shady in that regard. i fully upgraded the machine when i got it. 16gb ram, 1tb samsung 980 ssd. the performance actually is comparable to my tower in many respects. i have a geforce 980, an octocore amd cpu, and 24gb ddr3 ram in my tower. this laptop of course has a little less ram, but it plays games about just as well as on my tower. i really am surprised at this. the cooling situation is absolutely garbage with this laptop. the engineers put the cpu exhaust port pointing directly into the hinge portion of the case. this makes it so the computer is actively fighting by blowing air into a 1/5 cm gap. there is just a row of holes in the bottle for air intake. i picked up a tray with a cooling fan pad and that solved the heat problem. i see it having problems in the future just because of how they designed the fan. the excess heat not only kills your hardware lifespan but it slows your machine down by auto throttling. if i could i would have installed heat spreaders all over the inside of this machine, but there just is not room. they could not even be bothered to make the air inlets in the front of the case. it is asking to burn up after so many years deliberately. i had problems with hp in the past, they screwed up a laptop return i sent in, then blamed me for water damage when i had before and after pictures, so i am not shocked at how they treat customers. i swore i would not buy another hp but this one was just too cheap to pass up. it is super light weight. the camera is nothing fancy, in windows 11, you will find you lack all of your audio enhancement options. it is instead been replaced by this crap hp audio tool. ditch it as soon as you can and find something like pulse audio so you can hear out of the cheap cheap cheap dog szzz cheap speakers. you will also want to get a good set of headphones. the performance is a little low unless you do add that second stick of ram as so many other people have pointed out. the machine simply was not designed properly, and they are taking it out of the consumers pocket by keeping them ignorant and not showing important aspects such as showing how the fan is smack dab in the middle of a 1/2cm gap. when you close the lid and open it after 20 minutes you will find it is incredibly warm if you have it hooked up to hdmi. it forces you to keep the screen open, which is not good to have static screens. i honestly think the burned out pixel happened just from the excess heat, but there is not anything i can do about it. it is not that bad, but once you see something you can never unsee it. i have a warranty but again, it is not going to cover this damage, so i spent money and not even 30 days later it has depreciated in value by the price of the lcd screen. the case is the cheapest plastic they could find. given this was produced during the pandemic you are left with another problem. check your ram speeds. if you get stuck with a 1r16 chip you are basically having 1 librarian trying to organize 16 shelves, whereas the good ram 2r8 would be equal to 2 librarians keeping up with 8 shelves. now you can see how the extra work load slows your machine. they do not mention this in their sales page or documentation, and you will only find out after you get it and run software to look at it, or pull the machine apart. overall, i probably would not buy this machine again, even though it works fast for an entry level computer. it is just too poorly designed. i give it a year or two before it fails. most likely, knowing hp it will be 26 minutes after the oem warranty expires. they used this planned obsolescence to rip off customers, and even though it is been nearly 8 years since i swore i would not buy another one, they changed; for the worse.",4/5,"when you close the lid and open it after 20 minutes you will find it is incredibly warm if you have it hooked up to hdmi | they do not mention this in their sales page or documentation, and you will only find out after you get it and run software to look at it, or pull the machine apart | most likely, knowing hp it will be 26 minutes after the oem warranty expires",0.22,"['incredibly warm', '', '']"

1208,"m1 pro chip is super powerful - photo/video editing, graphic design - this thing just kills it. compared to previous macbook pro, it is a giant leap ahead. these tasks are a main reason to buy the pro version of the macbook. this particularly model is the lower end of the spec you can get for a pro, but it still kicks butt. you can get the pro max chip and bump up the ram to 64gb if you want - and add tons more storage. the 14 inch macbook pro is the perfect size for a balance of portability and power. it can do pretty much everything the 16 inch version does. the display is stunning. just gorgeous. 120hz capability (pro motion) gets rid of blur when scrolling and makes for clearer action when viewing movies. the brightness and black levels on the display are awesome. real hdr viewing - a big difference. you will hear about ""the notch"" at the top of the screen where the camera is. after 10 minutes i do not even notice it. it means nothing for your experience. its just something critics have chosen to harp about. in most apps the notch is no even visible. camera is now a full 1080p and is a big upgrade over previous macbooks. six speaker sound system with new woofers - sounds incredible. music/movies it feels like surround sound. for video conferencing the microphones are studio quality and you can tell - this is great for video conferencing. the keyboard is a dream to type on. very solid like all macbooks, no spongy feel you get with so many other laptops. the apple magic keyboard is the best - as is the track pad. battery life is amazing. i have gone all day on battery without needing to plug in. at best its spec says 17 hours, which is crazy! especially for this spec...but for real world use with a mix of tasks, it will not be 17 hours but i did a 9 hour session yesterday, and still had a ton of battery left. the power efficiency is ground breaking. they have added back the magsafe power plug - which is great! and added back an sd card slot and and an hdmi port - which many of us hated the previous macs that deleted these ports. i wish it had at least one usb-a old style port - but it does not. you get three usb-c thunderbolt 4 ports that you can use with adapters if needed. they got rid of the touch screen bar at the top of the keyboard from previous pro macbooks and put back the regular mechanical keys for the controls. apparently they listened to a lot of users who did not really like the touch pad. the shape and style of this laptop is great. some say the edge of the laptop looks ""sharp"" where your wrists rest. that is bs. i have been typing most of the day and i do not feel any issue with the edge of the laptop at all. very comfy for typing. some haters may try to find reasons to bash this new macbook pro, but i am telling you - from any perspective, all brand bias aside - this is an amazing laptop - the best apple has ever made, hands down. and i would say you will not find a better power laptop anywhere. all that said - this is not a gamers machine. apple is not for hard core gamers. i mean you can play games on it that you get from the app store. i am a hard core gamer and a pc geek - i have a powerful windows pc for gaming. and always will. but for everything else. this macbook is king. i use to for music, for photo and video editing, for productivity. i can plut into a giant monitor if i want a bigger screen - it works great on my 34 inch ips panel. so if you are wondering if this macbook 14 inch pro is the real deal or not - i am here to tell you, its the real deal. i finally upgraded from my 2015 macbook pro because this new one hits so many sweet spots - revolutionary power and battery life, excellent ergonomic design, great sound, stunning display - its the whole package. if you are thinking of getting one - you will not be disappointed. one last comment. i am an old timer windows guy, and i know all the counter arguments for the mac. many wills say this is overpriced compared to a windows laptop with similar spec. first, show me an intel based laptop that can match these new m1 pro chips - you cannot. and aside from that, the mac os is secure and stable - rock solid - and is intuitive with amazing features - like the ability to copy and paste text from a photo! whaaat?

1560,"this does not have touch screen on my model. the fhd display really surprised me. it is better picture than a lot of these tvs. as with all products they hide the defects from you until a month later. as soon as the 33th day rolled on i turned on the laptop and discovered sure enough it is got a burnt pixel. no way to fix that without replacing the screen. unless you have 5+ burned out pixels, good luck getting a return or any repairs. hp is still shady in that regard. i fully upgraded the machine when i got it. 16gb ram, 1tb samsung 980 ssd. the performance actually is comparable to my tower in many respects. i have a geforce 980, an octocore amd cpu, and 24gb ddr3 ram in my tower. this laptop of course has a little less ram, but it plays games about just as well as on my tower. i really am surprised at this. the cooling situation is absolutely garbage with this laptop. the engineers put the cpu exhaust port pointing directly into the hinge portion of the case. this makes it so the computer is actively fighting by blowing air into a 1/5 cm gap. there is just a row of holes in the bottle for air intake. i picked up a tray with a cooling fan pad and that solved the heat problem. i see it having problems in the future just because of how they designed the fan. the excess heat not only kills your hardware lifespan but it slows your machine down by auto throttling. if i could i would have installed heat spreaders all over the inside of this machine, but there just is not room. they could not even be bothered to make the air inlets in the front of the case. it is asking to burn up after so many years deliberately. i had problems with hp in the past, they screwed up a laptop return i sent in, then blamed me for water damage when i had before and after pictures, so i am not shocked at how they treat customers. i swore i would not buy another hp but this one was just too cheap to pass up. it is super light weight. the camera is nothing fancy, in windows 11, you will find you lack all of your audio enhancement options. it is instead been replaced by this crap hp audio tool. ditch it as soon as you can and find something like pulse audio so you can hear out of the cheap cheap cheap dog szzz cheap speakers. you will also want to get a good set of headphones. the performance is a little low unless you do add that second stick of ram as so many other people have pointed out. the machine simply was not designed properly, and they are taking it out of the consumers pocket by keeping them ignorant and not showing important aspects such as showing how the fan is smack dab in the middle of a 1/2cm gap. when you close the lid and open it after 20 minutes you will find it is incredibly warm if you have it hooked up to hdmi. it forces you to keep the screen open, which is not good to have static screens. i honestly think the burned out pixel happened just from the excess heat, but there is not anything i can do about it. it is not that bad, but once you see something you can never unsee it. i have a warranty but again, it is not going to cover this damage, so i spent money and not even 30 days later it has depreciated in value by the price of the lcd screen. the case is the cheapest plastic they could find. given this was produced during the pandemic you are left with another problem. check your ram speeds. if you get stuck with a 1r16 chip you are basically having 1 librarian trying to organize 16 shelves, whereas the good ram 2r8 would be equal to 2 librarians keeping up with 8 shelves. now you can see how the extra work load slows your machine. they do not mention this in their sales page or documentation, and you will only find out after you get it and run software to look at it, or pull the machine apart. overall, i probably would not buy this machine again, even though it works fast for an entry level computer. it is just too poorly designed. i give it a year or two before it fails. most likely, knowing hp it will be 26 minutes after the oem warranty expires. they used this planned obsolescence to rip off customers, and even though it is been nearly 8 years since i swore i would not buy another one, they changed; for the worse.",4/5,"when you close the lid and open it after 20 minutes you will find it is incredibly warm if you have it hooked up to hdmi | they do not mention this in their sales page or documentation, and you will only find out after you get it and run software to look at it, or pull the machine apart | most likely, knowing hp it will be 26 minutes after the oem warranty expires",0.22,"['incredibly warm', '', '']"

1743,"i will put this first. i am unsure if the ram or solid state drive is set or if you can upgrade them. i did not try to open or upgrade the item. these are the two things you should research before purchasing this. although with the current specification, i am sure you do not need to do that. this acer laptop overall is an average size laptop and the specification are not bad for what you get. this laptop is relatively thin and not too heavy. it has a decent processor (ryzen 7). the ram is 16 gb which is well beyond the suggested nowadays. it will definitely work for most daily usage as well as design and gaming. that being said, it is not the best in terms of battery life. it really only last about three to four hours at most on a full charge. the fan is a bit loud on heavy usage. it is a standard ac charger which can make it a bit annoying to replace in the future if needed. the power brick is okay but does get hot while charging. you will need it plugged in to really game on this device. upon boot up of the acer laptop, the laptop boots up fairly quick. the setup is pretty straight forward and does not require any driver installation. the bloatware is not too terrible. the laptop also has only a 14 inch screen with the max resolution at 1920 x 1080. the screen has an okay brightness but not the best quality. it still keep the traditional two usb port as well so you do not have to buy an adapter for this laptop while also having the type c (non thunderbolt) port. the laptop can be angled back for better viewing but it cannot be pushed back all the way. the laptop surface where the wrist rest is where i do not like the material. it looks nice with the bright silver but with long term use it will fade over time. the keys are okay, but not the best. i am not a fan of typing on them as it just feels a bit on the cheaper end. the external casing of this surface is very easy to scratch (seems to be an issue with all this material) so i would recommend that you get a laptop case for it. the trackpad runs pretty well, it is sensitive and feels smooth to move across. it also does not look like it will wear down easily which is good. there is a camera that will record at at least 720p. you could put a web cam cover on it. the dual microphone makes for a very clear voice and i have not had any issues with any sound issues. it usually does not pick up too much surrounding noise and focuses more on voice. on laptop, there is a 3.5 port to plug in headphones/microphone. it does have dual band wifi built in and no issues with speed/connection. the laptop itself can last about five to six hours or so on a full charge. depending on how much you have open and how much you utilize the laptop capability, you could actually have less than that. best thing to do is just balance the resource as best you can. the overall charge time depends but it can take up to three to charge the laptop to 100% from what i can tell. it is not too long and the charger does get hot so handle with care. it has a decent boot up being less than fifteen seconds to boot up but the bloatware has to go so i would recommend you uninstall that if possible. the speaker system is pretty loud but they do have a bit of a feedback noise that is a bit annoying but that is okay. the 3060 ti runs great! it is a very powerful card that allows you to game very well on this computer although the screen is only 14 inches. the fan also is a bit loud on high usage (gaming). the processor is an ryzen 7 which is more than enough power for what i need it to do on a daily. in terms of video games, it can play many games at very high quality although you do need to have it plugged in. the processing speed is really fast and it works really well for what i need. there is an hdmi port so you are able to connect this to an external screen. i am unsure if there is a dock that is meant for this laptop. overall this laptop is a a very powerful laptop. you get a smaller screen but the gaming on it is not bad. the acer laptop can run a bit hot and the battery life is not the best. the specification is not bad at 16 gb ram and 512 gb ssd drive. the space is decent for what i need it for but for gaming it will fill up fast. it is good for all around use and can easily be made into a work, gaming, or basic computer with a single monitor connection.",5/5,"it will definitely work for most daily usage as well as design and gaming | it really only last about three to four hours at most on a full charge | the trackpad runs pretty well, it is sensitive and feels smooth to move across | it has a decent boot up being less than fifteen seconds to boot up but the bloatware has to go so i would recommend you uninstall that if possible",0.16,"['', '', 'sensitive smooth', '']"

2138,"this does not have touch screen on my model. the fhd display really surprised me. it is better picture than a lot of these tvs. as with all products they hide the defects from you until a month later. as soon as the 33th day rolled on i turned on the laptop and discovered sure enough it is got a burnt pixel. no way to fix that without replacing the screen. unless you have 5+ burned out pixels, good luck getting a return or any repairs. hp is still shady in that regard. i fully upgraded the machine when i got it. 16gb ram, 1tb samsung 980 ssd. the performance actually is comparable to my tower in many respects. i have a geforce 980, an octocore amd cpu, and 24gb ddr3 ram in my tower. this laptop of course has a little less ram, but it plays games about just as well as on my tower. i really am surprised at this. the cooling situation is absolutely garbage with this laptop. the engineers put the cpu exhaust port pointing directly into the hinge portion of the case. this makes it so the computer is actively fighting by blowing air into a 1/5 cm gap. there is just a row of holes in the bottle for air intake. i picked up a tray with a cooling fan pad and that solved the heat problem. i see it having problems in the future just because of how they designed the fan. the excess heat not only kills your hardware lifespan but it slows your machine down by auto throttling. if i could i would have installed heat spreaders all over the inside of this machine, but there just is not room. they could not even be bothered to make the air inlets in the front of the case. it is asking to burn up after so many years deliberately. i had problems with hp in the past, they screwed up a laptop return i sent in, then blamed me for water damage when i had before and after pictures, so i am not shocked at how they treat customers. i swore i would not buy another hp but this one was just too cheap to pass up. it is super light weight. the camera is nothing fancy, in windows 11, you will find you lack all of your audio enhancement options. it is instead been replaced by this crap hp audio tool. ditch it as soon as you can and find something like pulse audio so you can hear out of the cheap cheap cheap dog szzz cheap speakers. you will also want to get a good set of headphones. the performance is a little low unless you do add that second stick of ram as so many other people have pointed out. the machine simply was not designed properly, and they are taking it out of the consumers pocket by keeping them ignorant and not showing important aspects such as showing how the fan is smack dab in the middle of a 1/2cm gap. when you close the lid and open it after 20 minutes you will find it is incredibly warm if you have it hooked up to hdmi. it forces you to keep the screen open, which is not good to have static screens. i honestly think the burned out pixel happened just from the excess heat, but there is not anything i can do about it. it is not that bad, but once you see something you can never unsee it. i have a warranty but again, it is not going to cover this damage, so i spent money and not even 30 days later it has depreciated in value by the price of the lcd screen. the case is the cheapest plastic they could find. given this was produced during the pandemic you are left with another problem. check your ram speeds. if you get stuck with a 1r16 chip you are basically having 1 librarian trying to organize 16 shelves, whereas the good ram 2r8 would be equal to 2 librarians keeping up with 8 shelves. now you can see how the extra work load slows your machine. they do not mention this in their sales page or documentation, and you will only find out after you get it and run software to look at it, or pull the machine apart. overall, i probably would not buy this machine again, even though it works fast for an entry level computer. it is just too poorly designed. i give it a year or two before it fails. most likely, knowing hp it will be 26 minutes after the oem warranty expires. they used this planned obsolescence to rip off customers, and even though it is been nearly 8 years since i swore i would not buy another one, they changed; for the worse.",4/5,"when you close the lid and open it after 20 minutes you will find it is incredibly warm if you have it hooked up to hdmi | they do not mention this in their sales page or documentation, and you will only find out after you get it and run software to look at it, or pull the machine apart | most likely, knowing hp it will be 26 minutes after the oem warranty expires",0.22,"['incredibly warm', '', '']"

2504,"m1 pro chip is super powerful - photo/video editing, graphic design - this thing just kills it. compared to previous macbook pro, it is a giant leap ahead. these tasks are a main reason to buy the pro version of the macbook. this particularly model is the lower end of the spec you can get for a pro, but it still kicks butt. you can get the pro max chip and bump up the ram to 64gb if you want - and add tons more storage. the 14 inch macbook pro is the perfect size for a balance of portability and power. it can do pretty much everything the 16 inch version does. the display is stunning. just gorgeous. 120hz capability (pro motion) gets rid of blur when scrolling and makes for clearer action when viewing movies. the brightness and black levels on the display are awesome. real hdr viewing - a big difference. you will hear about ""the notch"" at the top of the screen where the camera is. after 10 minutes i do not even notice it. it means nothing for your experience. its just something critics have chosen to harp about. in most apps the notch is no even visible. camera is now a full 1080p and is a big upgrade over previous macbooks. six speaker sound system with new woofers - sounds incredible. music/movies it feels like surround sound. for video conferencing the microphones are studio quality and you can tell - this is great for video conferencing. the keyboard is a dream to type on. very solid like all macbooks, no spongy feel you get with so many other laptops. the apple magic keyboard is the best - as is the track pad. battery life is amazing. i have gone all day on battery without needing to plug in. at best its spec says 17 hours, which is crazy! especially for this spec...but for real world use with a mix of tasks, it will not be 17 hours but i did a 9 hour session yesterday, and still had a ton of battery left. the power efficiency is ground breaking. they have added back the magsafe power plug - which is great! and added back an sd card slot and and an hdmi port - which many of us hated the previous macs that deleted these ports. i wish it had at least one usb-a old style port - but it does not. you get three usb-c thunderbolt 4 ports that you can use with adapters if needed. they got rid of the touch screen bar at the top of the keyboard from previous pro macbooks and put back the regular mechanical keys for the controls. apparently they listened to a lot of users who did not really like the touch pad. the shape and style of this laptop is great. some say the edge of the laptop looks ""sharp"" where your wrists rest. that is bs. i have been typing most of the day and i do not feel any issue with the edge of the laptop at all. very comfy for typing. some haters may try to find reasons to bash this new macbook pro, but i am telling you - from any perspective, all brand bias aside - this is an amazing laptop - the best apple has ever made, hands down. and i would say you will not find a better power laptop anywhere. all that said - this is not a gamers machine. apple is not for hard core gamers. i mean you can play games on it that you get from the app store. i am a hard core gamer and a pc geek - i have a powerful windows pc for gaming. and always will. but for everything else. this macbook is king. i use to for music, for photo and video editing, for productivity. i can plut into a giant monitor if i want a bigger screen - it works great on my 34 inch ips panel. so if you are wondering if this macbook 14 inch pro is the real deal or not - i am here to tell you, its the real deal. i finally upgraded from my 2015 macbook pro because this new one hits so many sweet spots - revolutionary power and battery life, excellent ergonomic design, great sound, stunning display - its the whole package. if you are thinking of getting one - you will not be disappointed. one last comment. i am an old timer windows guy, and i know all the counter arguments for the mac. many wills say this is overpriced compared to a windows laptop with similar spec. first, show me an intel based laptop that can match these new m1 pro chips - you cannot. and aside from that, the mac os is secure and stable - rock solid - and is intuitive with amazing features - like the ability to copy and paste text from a photo! whaaat?

3442,"this does not have touch screen on my model. the fhd display really surprised me. it is better picture than a lot of these tvs. as with all products they hide the defects from you until a month later. as soon as the 33th day rolled on i turned on the laptop and discovered sure enough it is got a burnt pixel. no way to fix that without replacing the screen. unless you have 5+ burned out pixels, good luck getting a return or any repairs. hp is still shady in that regard. i fully upgraded the machine when i got it. 16gb ram, 1tb samsung 980 ssd. the performance actually is comparable to my tower in many respects. i have a geforce 980, an octocore amd cpu, and 24gb ddr3 ram in my tower. this laptop of course has a little less ram, but it plays games about just as well as on my tower. i really am surprised at this. the cooling situation is absolutely garbage with this laptop. the engineers put the cpu exhaust port pointing directly into the hinge portion of the case. this makes it so the computer is actively fighting by blowing air into a 1/5 cm gap. there is just a row of holes in the bottle for air intake. i picked up a tray with a cooling fan pad and that solved the heat problem. i see it having problems in the future just because of how they designed the fan. the excess heat not only kills your hardware lifespan but it slows your machine down by auto throttling. if i could i would have installed heat spreaders all over the inside of this machine, but there just is not room. they could not even be bothered to make the air inlets in the front of the case. it is asking to burn up after so many years deliberately. i had problems with hp in the past, they screwed up a laptop return i sent in, then blamed me for water damage when i had before and after pictures, so i am not shocked at how they treat customers. i swore i would not buy another hp but this one was just too cheap to pass up. it is super light weight. the camera is nothing fancy, in windows 11, you will find you lack all of your audio enhancement options. it is instead been replaced by this crap hp audio tool. ditch it as soon as you can and find something like pulse audio so you can hear out of the cheap cheap cheap dog szzz cheap speakers. you will also want to get a good set of headphones. the performance is a little low unless you do add that second stick of ram as so many other people have pointed out. the machine simply was not designed properly, and they are taking it out of the consumers pocket by keeping them ignorant and not showing important aspects such as showing how the fan is smack dab in the middle of a 1/2cm gap. when you close the lid and open it after 20 minutes you will find it is incredibly warm if you have it hooked up to hdmi. it forces you to keep the screen open, which is not good to have static screens. i honestly think the burned out pixel happened just from the excess heat, but there is not anything i can do about it. it is not that bad, but once you see something you can never unsee it. i have a warranty but again, it is not going to cover this damage, so i spent money and not even 30 days later it has depreciated in value by the price of the lcd screen. the case is the cheapest plastic they could find. given this was produced during the pandemic you are left with another problem. check your ram speeds. if you get stuck with a 1r16 chip you are basically having 1 librarian trying to organize 16 shelves, whereas the good ram 2r8 would be equal to 2 librarians keeping up with 8 shelves. now you can see how the extra work load slows your machine. they do not mention this in their sales page or documentation, and you will only find out after you get it and run software to look at it, or pull the machine apart. overall, i probably would not buy this machine again, even though it works fast for an entry level computer. it is just too poorly designed. i give it a year or two before it fails. most likely, knowing hp it will be 26 minutes after the oem warranty expires. they used this planned obsolescence to rip off customers, and even though it is been nearly 8 years since i swore i would not buy another one, they changed; for the worse.",4/5,"when you close the lid and open it after 20 minutes you will find it is incredibly warm if you have it hooked up to hdmi | they do not mention this in their sales page or documentation, and you will only find out after you get it and run software to look at it, or pull the machine apart | most likely, knowing hp it will be 26 minutes after the oem warranty expires",0.22,"['incredibly warm', '', '']"

3836,"m1 pro chip is super powerful - photo/video editing, graphic design - this thing just kills it. compared to previous macbook pro, it is a giant leap ahead. these tasks are a main reason to buy the pro version of the macbook. this particularly model is the lower end of the spec you can get for a pro, but it still kicks butt. you can get the pro max chip and bump up the ram to 64gb if you want - and add tons more storage. the 14 inch macbook pro is the perfect size for a balance of portability and power. it can do pretty much everything the 16 inch version does. the display is stunning. just gorgeous. 120hz capability (pro motion) gets rid of blur when scrolling and makes for clearer action when viewing movies. the brightness and black levels on the display are awesome. real hdr viewing - a big difference. you will hear about ""the notch"" at the top of the screen where the camera is. after 10 minutes i do not even notice it. it means nothing for your experience. its just something critics have chosen to harp about. in most apps the notch is no even visible. camera is now a full 1080p and is a big upgrade over previous macbooks. six speaker sound system with new woofers - sounds incredible. music/movies it feels like surround sound. for video conferencing the microphones are studio quality and you can tell - this is great for video conferencing. the keyboard is a dream to type on. very solid like all macbooks, no spongy feel you get with so many other laptops. the apple magic keyboard is the best - as is the track pad. battery life is amazing. i have gone all day on battery without needing to plug in. at best its spec says 17 hours, which is crazy! especially for this spec...but for real world use with a mix of tasks, it will not be 17 hours but i did a 9 hour session yesterday, and still had a ton of battery left. the power efficiency is ground breaking. they have added back the magsafe power plug - which is great! and added back an sd card slot and and an hdmi port - which many of us hated the previous macs that deleted these ports. i wish it had at least one usb-a old style port - but it does not. you get three usb-c thunderbolt 4 ports that you can use with adapters if needed. they got rid of the touch screen bar at the top of the keyboard from previous pro macbooks and put back the regular mechanical keys for the controls. apparently they listened to a lot of users who did not really like the touch pad. the shape and style of this laptop is great. some say the edge of the laptop looks ""sharp"" where your wrists rest. that is bs. i have been typing most of the day and i do not feel any issue with the edge of the laptop at all. very comfy for typing. some haters may try to find reasons to bash this new macbook pro, but i am telling you - from any perspective, all brand bias aside - this is an amazing laptop - the best apple has ever made, hands down. and i would say you will not find a better power laptop anywhere. all that said - this is not a gamers machine. apple is not for hard core gamers. i mean you can play games on it that you get from the app store. i am a hard core gamer and a pc geek - i have a powerful windows pc for gaming. and always will. but for everything else. this macbook is king. i use to for music, for photo and video editing, for productivity. i can plut into a giant monitor if i want a bigger screen - it works great on my 34 inch ips panel. so if you are wondering if this macbook 14 inch pro is the real deal or not - i am here to tell you, its the real deal. i finally upgraded from my 2015 macbook pro because this new one hits so many sweet spots - revolutionary power and battery life, excellent ergonomic design, great sound, stunning display - its the whole package. if you are thinking of getting one - you will not be disappointed. one last comment. i am an old timer windows guy, and i know all the counter arguments for the mac. many wills say this is overpriced compared to a windows laptop with similar spec. first, show me an intel based laptop that can match these new m1 pro chips - you cannot. and aside from that, the mac os is secure and stable - rock solid - and is intuitive with amazing features - like the ability to copy and paste text from a photo! whaaat?

3994,"m1 pro chip is super powerful - photo/video editing, graphic design - this thing just kills it. compared to previous macbook pro, it is a giant leap ahead. these tasks are a main reason to buy the pro version of the macbook. this particularly model is the lower end of the spec you can get for a pro, but it still kicks butt. you can get the pro max chip and bump up the ram to 64gb if you want - and add tons more storage. the 14 inch macbook pro is the perfect size for a balance of portability and power. it can do pretty much everything the 16 inch version does. the display is stunning. just gorgeous. 120hz capability (pro motion) gets rid of blur when scrolling and makes for clearer action when viewing movies. the brightness and black levels on the display are awesome. real hdr viewing - a big difference. you will hear about ""the notch"" at the top of the screen where the camera is. after 10 minutes i do not even notice it. it means nothing for your experience. its just something critics have chosen to harp about. in most apps the notch is no even visible. camera is now a full 1080p and is a big upgrade over previous macbooks. six speaker sound system with new woofers - sounds incredible. music/movies it feels like surround sound. for video conferencing the microphones are studio quality and you can tell - this is great for video conferencing. the keyboard is a dream to type on. very solid like all macbooks, no spongy feel you get with so many other laptops. the apple magic keyboard is the best - as is the track pad. battery life is amazing. i have gone all day on battery without needing to plug in. at best its spec says 17 hours, which is crazy! especially for this spec...but for real world use with a mix of tasks, it will not be 17 hours but i did a 9 hour session yesterday, and still had a ton of battery left. the power efficiency is ground breaking. they have added back the magsafe power plug - which is great! and added back an sd card slot and and an hdmi port - which many of us hated the previous macs that deleted these ports. i wish it had at least one usb-a old style port - but it does not. you get three usb-c thunderbolt 4 ports that you can use with adapters if needed. they got rid of the touch screen bar at the top of the keyboard from previous pro macbooks and put back the regular mechanical keys for the controls. apparently they listened to a lot of users who did not really like the touch pad. the shape and style of this laptop is great. some say the edge of the laptop looks ""sharp"" where your wrists rest. that is bs. i have been typing most of the day and i do not feel any issue with the edge of the laptop at all. very comfy for typing. some haters may try to find reasons to bash this new macbook pro, but i am telling you - from any perspective, all brand bias aside - this is an amazing laptop - the best apple has ever made, hands down. and i would say you will not find a better power laptop anywhere. all that said - this is not a gamers machine. apple is not for hard core gamers. i mean you can play games on it that you get from the app store. i am a hard core gamer and a pc geek - i have a powerful windows pc for gaming. and always will. but for everything else. this macbook is king. i use to for music, for photo and video editing, for productivity. i can plut into a giant monitor if i want a bigger screen - it works great on my 34 inch ips panel. so if you are wondering if this macbook 14 inch pro is the real deal or not - i am here to tell you, its the real deal. i finally upgraded from my 2015 macbook pro because this new one hits so many sweet spots - revolutionary power and battery life, excellent ergonomic design, great sound, stunning display - its the whole package. if you are thinking of getting one - you will not be disappointed. one last comment. i am an old timer windows guy, and i know all the counter arguments for the mac. many wills say this is overpriced compared to a windows laptop with similar spec. first, show me an intel based laptop that can match these new m1 pro chips - you cannot. and aside from that, the mac os is secure and stable - rock solid - and is intuitive with amazing features - like the ability to copy and paste text from a photo! whaaat? and the design/ergonomics/quality of these macbooks is unmatched. so, yes you pay more - but you get more. my last macbook pro lasted me almost 7 years and it still works great. if you want this laptop - get it! it rocks.",5/5,"its just something critics have chosen to harp about | in most apps the notch is no even visible | i have been typing most of the day and i do not feel any issue with the edge of the laptop at all | and aside from that, the mac os is secure and stable - rock solid - and is intuitive with amazing features - like the ability to copy and paste text from a photo! whaaat?

4009,"i was a bit concerned about the fact that apple has moved away from intel and is now producing their own m1 processor but i have to say it is incredibly fast. my company provides me with my computer of choice for work and in 2020 i received a top of the line macbook pro with an intel 8 core i9 processor and 64gb of memory and 4tb ssd that retailed for close to $5,000 and i have to say this new macbook pro with the 10 core m1, 16 core gpu, 1tb ssd and only 16gb of memory at almost half that price seems much faster. the display is just stunning. the graphics quality is among the best i have seen and video performance is flawless. it is everything a macbook pro should be. high performance in a sleek aluminum case. a couple of things to note if you are not familiar with this computer and thinking of buying one. it only comes with 3 usb-c / thunderbolt 3 interfaces. so you are going to need adapters if you plan on using any wired peripheral devices like keyboard, mouse, external drives etc.. that have standard usb interfaces. and at a minimum you should be backing your system up to an external drive. so, i would recommend buying a usb-c to usb hub as i am not big on adapters. there is several here on amazon in the $20-30 range. also, like most other manufacturers, apple has dropped the dvd/cd. it is not even an option. if burning dvds and cds is still a thing for you, again you can connect an external device with a hub or adapter. i would also recommend buying a cooling tray, especially if you are going to leave this computer on a desk powered up perpetually or for long periods of time so you can protect the cpu and more importantly the gpu from heat. lastly, a few words on macos montery that shipped with this computer. the most recent os i was using was sierra on my mbp 2013 and the learning curve was not difficult at all. my only complaint is monterey turns on a lot of stuff i do not need or even want. for example, as soon as i signed in with my apple id to sync my music from icloud, i started getting texts, facetime and even phone calls for my entire family on my computer. we use the same apple id for all our devices for a number of reasons and while it was not too difficult to disable, i would rather apple leave that up to the user. i will post an update more geared toward the performance and reliability of this system as time goes by but for now, i have to say i am very pleased and would highly recommend this new macbook pro. one final comment on the purchase process. i actually ordered one directly from apple. i live about 60 miles from an apple store and wanted it shipped to me. i was given a projected ship date about 3 weeks after placing my order. after waiting almost the full 3 weeks, my order was still processing and had not moved toward the preparing to ship status. i then realized apple has a store here on amazon, they had exactly what i wanted in stock. so after canceling my order with apple, i bought my computer here on amazon and it arrived in 2 days.",5/5,"my company provides me with my computer of choice for work and in 2020 i received a top of the line macbook pro with an intel 8 core i9 processor and 64gb of memory and 4tb ssd that retailed for close to $5,000 and i have to say this new macbook pro with the 10 core m1, 16 core gpu, 1tb ssd and only 16gb of memory at almost half that price seems much faster | also, like most other manufacturers, apple has dropped the dvd/cd | lastly, a few words on macos montery that shipped with this computer | the most recent os i was using was sierra on my mbp 2013 and the learning curve was not difficult at all | i will post an update more geared toward the performance and reliability of this system as time goes by but for now, i have to say i am very pleased and would highly recommend this new macbook pro | after waiting almost the full 3 weeks, my order was still processing and had not moved toward the preparing to ship status",0.21,"['with pro', '', '', 'not difficult', 'very pleased', '']"

4195,"i will put this first. i am unsure if the ram or solid state drive is set or if you can upgrade them. i did not try to open or upgrade the item. these are the two things you should research before purchasing this. although with the current specification, i am sure you do not need to do that. this acer laptop overall is an average size laptop and the specification are not bad for what you get. this laptop is relatively thin and not too heavy. it has a decent processor (ryzen 7). the ram is 16 gb which is well beyond the suggested nowadays. it will definitely work for most daily usage as well as design and gaming. that being said, it is not the best in terms of battery life. it really only last about three to four hours at most on a full charge. the fan is a bit loud on heavy usage. it is a standard ac charger which can make it a bit annoying to replace in the future if needed. the power brick is okay but does get hot while charging. you will need it plugged in to really game on this device. upon boot up of the acer laptop, the laptop boots up fairly quick. the setup is pretty straight forward and does not require any driver installation. the bloatware is not too terrible. the laptop also has only a 14 inch screen with the max resolution at 1920 x 1080. the screen has an okay brightness but not the best quality. it still keep the traditional two usb port as well so you do not have to buy an adapter for this laptop while also having the type c (non thunderbolt) port. the laptop can be angled back for better viewing but it cannot be pushed back all the way. the laptop surface where the wrist rest is where i do not like the material. it looks nice with the bright silver but with long term use it will fade over time. the keys are okay, but not the best. i am not a fan of typing on them as it just feels a bit on the cheaper end. the external casing of this surface is very easy to scratch (seems to be an issue with all this material) so i would recommend that you get a laptop case for it. the trackpad runs pretty well, it is sensitive and feels smooth to move across. it also does not look like it will wear down easily which is good. there is a camera that will record at at least 720p. you could put a web cam cover on it. the dual microphone makes for a very clear voice and i have not had any issues with any sound issues. it usually does not pick up too much surrounding noise and focuses more on voice. on laptop, there is a 3.5 port to plug in headphones/microphone. it does have dual band wifi built in and no issues with speed/connection. the laptop itself can last about five to six hours or so on a full charge. depending on how much you have open and how much you utilize the laptop capability, you could actually have less than that. best thing to do is just balance the resource as best you can. the overall charge time depends but it can take up to three to charge the laptop to 100% from what i can tell. it is not too long and the charger does get hot so handle with care. it has a decent boot up being less than fifteen seconds to boot up but the bloatware has to go so i would recommend you uninstall that if possible. the speaker system is pretty loud but they do have a bit of a feedback noise that is a bit annoying but that is okay. the 3060 ti runs great! it is a very powerful card that allows you to game very well on this computer although the screen is only 14 inches. the fan also is a bit loud on high usage (gaming). the processor is an ryzen 7 which is more than enough power for what i need it to do on a daily. in terms of video games, it can play many games at very high quality although you do need to have it plugged in. the processing speed is really fast and it works really well for what i need. there is an hdmi port so you are able to connect this to an external screen. i am unsure if there is a dock that is meant for this laptop. overall this laptop is a a very powerful laptop. you get a smaller screen but the gaming on it is not bad. the acer laptop can run a bit hot and the battery life is not the best. the specification is not bad at 16 gb ram and 512 gb ssd drive. the space is decent for what i need it for but for gaming it will fill up fast. it is good for all around use and can easily be made into a work, gaming, or basic computer with a single monitor connection.",5/5,"it will definitely work for most daily usage as well as design and gaming | it really only last about three to four hours at most on a full charge | the trackpad runs pretty well, it is sensitive and feels smooth to move across | it has a decent boot up being less than fifteen seconds to boot up but the bloatware has to go so i would recommend you uninstall that if possible",0.16,"['', '', 'sensitive smooth', '']"

4427,"m1 pro chip is super powerful - photo/video editing, graphic design - this thing just kills it. compared to previous macbook pro, it is a giant leap ahead. these tasks are a main reason to buy the pro version of the macbook. this particularly model is the lower end of the spec you can get for a pro, but it still kicks butt. you can get the pro max chip and bump up the ram to 64gb if you want - and add tons more storage. the 14 inch macbook pro is the perfect size for a balance of portability and power. it can do pretty much everything the 16 inch version does. the display is stunning. just gorgeous. 120hz capability (pro motion) gets rid of blur when scrolling and makes for clearer action when viewing movies. the brightness and black levels on the display are awesome. real hdr viewing - a big difference. you will hear about ""the notch"" at the top of the screen where the camera is. after 10 minutes i do not even notice it. it means nothing for your experience. its just something critics have chosen to harp about. in most apps the notch is no even visible. camera is now a full 1080p and is a big upgrade over previous macbooks. six speaker sound system with new woofers - sounds incredible. music/movies it feels like surround sound. for video conferencing the microphones are studio quality and you can tell - this is great for video conferencing. the keyboard is a dream to type on. very solid like all macbooks, no spongy feel you get with so many other laptops. the apple magic keyboard is the best - as is the track pad. battery life is amazing. i have gone all day on battery without needing to plug in. at best its spec says 17 hours, which is crazy! especially for this spec...but for real world use with a mix of tasks, it will not be 17 hours but i did a 9 hour session yesterday, and still had a ton of battery left. the power efficiency is ground breaking. they have added back the magsafe power plug - which is great! and added back an sd card slot and and an hdmi port - which many of us hated the previous macs that deleted these ports. i wish it had at least one usb-a old style port - but it does not. you get three usb-c thunderbolt 4 ports that you can use with adapters if needed. they got rid of the touch screen bar at the top of the keyboard from previous pro macbooks and put back the regular mechanical keys for the controls. apparently they listened to a lot of users who did not really like the touch pad. the shape and style of this laptop is great. some say the edge of the laptop looks ""sharp"" where your wrists rest. that is bs. i have been typing most of the day and i do not feel any issue with the edge of the laptop at all. very comfy for typing. some haters may try to find reasons to bash this new macbook pro, but i am telling you - from any perspective, all brand bias aside - this is an amazing laptop - the best apple has ever made, hands down. and i would say you will not find a better power laptop anywhere. all that said - this is not a gamers machine. apple is not for hard core gamers. i mean you can play games on it that you get from the app store. i am a hard core gamer and a pc geek - i have a powerful windows pc for gaming. and always will. but for everything else. this macbook is king. i use to for music, for photo and video editing, for productivity. i can plut into a giant monitor if i want a bigger screen - it works great on my 34 inch ips panel. so if you are wondering if this macbook 14 inch pro is the real deal or not - i am here to tell you, its the real deal. i finally upgraded from my 2015 macbook pro because this new one hits so many sweet spots - revolutionary power and battery life, excellent ergonomic design, great sound, stunning display - its the whole package. if you are thinking of getting one - you will not be disappointed. one last comment. i am an old timer windows guy, and i know all the counter arguments for the mac. many wills say this is overpriced compared to a windows laptop with similar spec. first, show me an intel based laptop that can match these new m1 pro chips - you cannot. and aside from that, the mac os is secure and stable - rock solid - and is intuitive with amazing features - like the ability to copy and paste text from a photo! whaaat?

4566,"i have been in the market for two new laptops since we have had really bad luck with several of our devices breaking. as a single parent, needing to get two of them can be a big expense especially if they are just going to break again. i needed one for my son's school and one for my business. originally, i ordered this for myself, but i could not believe how durable and strong it is. it is definitely meant for heavy wear and tear or clumsy kids. when we were forced into remote learning my son had his first laptop which was borrowed, but no matter how hard he tried, he scratched it up so much and nearly trashed it. when i was reading about it, it makes me want to laugh when it said it is military grade because that is what i need to get when i buy my son things... something that is military grade because he is a hot hyperactive mess at times lol. my dogs and child need military grade. just opening and closing it walking around i feel so confident. it is not made of that easily scratched material. it has traction when you hold it as it is not slippery and has grip. knowing that it is spill proof is miraculous, but i will use my brain and not test that out. it is a small computer and screen but not too small where it is a problem. when you first set it up you choose if it is for a child or yourself. i have tried both options and did a ""whitewash"" factory reset to try the other. i like the features of the child as he needs to get permission to do certain things. you do have to set them up with an email address, and i created a new one just for this since i do not want him having access to my business or personal email information. there is a lot of tracking within it. when you first set it up it asks if you want google assistant, and when i click, ""no"" it still has it enabled so i had to go into the settings and switch it off since i do not need any extra tracking (even though we all know they track absolutely everything). yeah, i am one that puts a sticker over the camera hole too, but do not judge me. i really wish laptops did not connect all your other accounts when you first set it up. i miss the old days of feeling anonymous and not like somebody is up in my business. i just want to have my lock screen and zero requirements regarding an email or any other identifying information. nothing is private anymore. most people do not like that.",5/5,just opening and closing it walking around i feel so confident | when you first set it up you choose if it is for a child or yourself | most people do not like that,0.42,"['so confident', '', '']"

4642,"i will put this first. i am unsure if the ram or solid state drive is set or if you can upgrade them. i did not try to open or upgrade the item. these are the two things you should research before purchasing this. although with the current specification, i am sure you do not need to do that. this acer laptop overall is an average size laptop and the specification are not bad for what you get. this laptop is relatively thin and not too heavy. it has a decent processor (ryzen 7). the ram is 16 gb which is well beyond the suggested nowadays. it will definitely work for most daily usage as well as design and gaming. that being said, it is not the best in terms of battery life. it really only last about three to four hours at most on a full charge. the fan is a bit loud on heavy usage. it is a standard ac charger which can make it a bit annoying to replace in the future if needed. the power brick is okay but does get hot while charging. you will need it plugged in to really game on this device. upon boot up of the acer laptop, the laptop boots up fairly quick. the setup is pretty straight forward and does not require any driver installation. the bloatware is not too terrible. the laptop also has only a 14 inch screen with the max resolution at 1920 x 1080. the screen has an okay brightness but not the best quality. it still keep the traditional two usb port as well so you do not have to buy an adapter for this laptop while also having the type c (non thunderbolt) port. the laptop can be angled back for better viewing but it cannot be pushed back all the way. the laptop surface where the wrist rest is where i do not like the material. it looks nice with the bright silver but with long term use it will fade over time. the keys are okay, but not the best. i am not a fan of typing on them as it just feels a bit on the cheaper end. the external casing of this surface is very easy to scratch (seems to be an issue with all this material) so i would recommend that you get a laptop case for it. the trackpad runs pretty well, it is sensitive and feels smooth to move across. it also does not look like it will wear down easily which is good. there is a camera that will record at at least 720p. you could put a web cam cover on it. the dual microphone makes for a very clear voice and i have not had any issues with any sound issues. it usually does not pick up too much surrounding noise and focuses more on voice. on laptop, there is a 3.5 port to plug in headphones/microphone. it does have dual band wifi built in and no issues with speed/connection. the laptop itself can last about five to six hours or so on a full charge. depending on how much you have open and how much you utilize the laptop capability, you could actually have less than that. best thing to do is just balance the resource as best you can. the overall charge time depends but it can take up to three to charge the laptop to 100% from what i can tell. it is not too long and the charger does get hot so handle with care. it has a decent boot up being less than fifteen seconds to boot up but the bloatware has to go so i would recommend you uninstall that if possible. the speaker system is pretty loud but they do have a bit of a feedback noise that is a bit annoying but that is okay. the 3060 ti runs great! it is a very powerful card that allows you to game very well on this computer although the screen is only 14 inches. the fan also is a bit loud on high usage (gaming). the processor is an ryzen 7 which is more than enough power for what i need it to do on a daily. in terms of video games, it can play many games at very high quality although you do need to have it plugged in. the processing speed is really fast and it works really well for what i need. there is an hdmi port so you are able to connect this to an external screen. i am unsure if there is a dock that is meant for this laptop. overall this laptop is a a very powerful laptop. you get a smaller screen but the gaming on it is not bad. the acer laptop can run a bit hot and the battery life is not the best. the specification is not bad at 16 gb ram and 512 gb ssd drive. the space is decent for what i need it for but for gaming it will fill up fast. it is good for all around use and can easily be made into a work, gaming, or basic computer with a single monitor connection.",5/5,"it will definitely work for most daily usage as well as design and gaming | it really only last about three to four hours at most on a full charge | the trackpad runs pretty well, it is sensitive and feels smooth to move across | it has a decent boot up being less than fifteen seconds to boot up but the bloatware has to go so i would recommend you uninstall that if possible",0.16,"['', '', 'sensitive smooth', '']"

4667,"this does not have touch screen on my model. the fhd display really surprised me. it is better picture than a lot of these tvs. as with all products they hide the defects from you until a month later. as soon as the 33th day rolled on i turned on the laptop and discovered sure enough it is got a burnt pixel. no way to fix that without replacing the screen. unless you have 5+ burned out pixels, good luck getting a return or any repairs. hp is still shady in that regard. i fully upgraded the machine when i got it. 16gb ram, 1tb samsung 980 ssd. the performance actually is comparable to my tower in many respects. i have a geforce 980, an octocore amd cpu, and 24gb ddr3 ram in my tower. this laptop of course has a little less ram, but it plays games about just as well as on my tower. i really am surprised at this. the cooling situation is absolutely garbage with this laptop. the engineers put the cpu exhaust port pointing directly into the hinge portion of the case. this makes it so the computer is actively fighting by blowing air into a 1/5 cm gap. there is just a row of holes in the bottle for air intake. i picked up a tray with a cooling fan pad and that solved the heat problem. i see it having problems in the future just because of how they designed the fan. the excess heat not only kills your hardware lifespan but it slows your machine down by auto throttling. if i could i would have installed heat spreaders all over the inside of this machine, but there just is not room. they could not even be bothered to make the air inlets in the front of the case. it is asking to burn up after so many years deliberately. i had problems with hp in the past, they screwed up a laptop return i sent in, then blamed me for water damage when i had before and after pictures, so i am not shocked at how they treat customers. i swore i would not buy another hp but this one was just too cheap to pass up. it is super light weight. the camera is nothing fancy, in windows 11, you will find you lack all of your audio enhancement options. it is instead been replaced by this crap hp audio tool. ditch it as soon as you can and find something like pulse audio so you can hear out of the cheap cheap cheap dog szzz cheap speakers. you will also want to get a good set of headphones. the performance is a little low unless you do add that second stick of ram as so many other people have pointed out. the machine simply was not designed properly, and they are taking it out of the consumers pocket by keeping them ignorant and not showing important aspects such as showing how the fan is smack dab in the middle of a 1/2cm gap. when you close the lid and open it after 20 minutes you will find it is incredibly warm if you have it hooked up to hdmi. it forces you to keep the screen open, which is not good to have static screens. i honestly think the burned out pixel happened just from the excess heat, but there is not anything i can do about it. it is not that bad, but once you see something you can never unsee it. i have a warranty but again, it is not going to cover this damage, so i spent money and not even 30 days later it has depreciated in value by the price of the lcd screen. the case is the cheapest plastic they could find. given this was produced during the pandemic you are left with another problem. check your ram speeds. if you get stuck with a 1r16 chip you are basically having 1 librarian trying to organize 16 shelves, whereas the good ram 2r8 would be equal to 2 librarians keeping up with 8 shelves. now you can see how the extra work load slows your machine. they do not mention this in their sales page or documentation, and you will only find out after you get it and run software to look at it, or pull the machine apart. overall, i probably would not buy this machine again, even though it works fast for an entry level computer. it is just too poorly designed. i give it a year or two before it fails. most likely, knowing hp it will be 26 minutes after the oem warranty expires. they used this planned obsolescence to rip off customers, and even though it is been nearly 8 years since i swore i would not buy another one, they changed; for the worse.",4/5,"when you close the lid and open it after 20 minutes you will find it is incredibly warm if you have it hooked up to hdmi | they do not mention this in their sales page or documentation, and you will only find out after you get it and run software to look at it, or pull the machine apart | most likely, knowing hp it will be 26 minutes after the oem warranty expires",0.22,"['incredibly warm', '', '']"

""you screwed up my computer and for $99 you will fix it"". i said i would not pay such ransom ware money. i would throw my computer away first and buy a new one. i contacted acer tech support and they said they would fix it for nothing. they did, and when asked how i could keep this from happening again they said just unclick the ""automatic update button"". i did just that and for 4 years i loved my computer again.) an update to my review: the laptop arrived with a crack on the face just to the left of the top left speaker. i returned the computer to the supplier and they gave me credit for it minus $77.70 for a restocking charge. no doubt they are restocking the computer so they can sell it to you and pull the same scam on you.-----------a further update on my refund----------the seller (tech deals store) is refusing to refund all my money since i opened the box and started using it before i discovered the crack. i have asked for a full refund, and am awaiting their answer. if i do not receive my money then i will contact amazon and ask them for the remainder off my refund. if that does not work then i will file a dispute with my credit card company.

4743,"m1 pro chip is super powerful - photo/video editing, graphic design - this thing just kills it. compared to previous macbook pro, it is a giant leap ahead. these tasks are a main reason to buy the pro version of the macbook. this particularly model is the lower end of the spec you can get for a pro, but it still kicks butt. you can get the pro max chip and bump up the ram to 64gb if you want - and add tons more storage. the 14 inch macbook pro is the perfect size for a balance of portability and power. it can do pretty much everything the 16 inch version does. the display is stunning. just gorgeous. 120hz capability (pro motion) gets rid of blur when scrolling and makes for clearer action when viewing movies. the brightness and black levels on the display are awesome. real hdr viewing - a big difference. you will hear about ""the notch"" at the top of the screen where the camera is. after 10 minutes i do not even notice it. it means nothing for your experience. its just something critics have chosen to harp about. in most apps the notch is no even visible. camera is now a full 1080p and is a big upgrade over previous macbooks. six speaker sound system with new woofers - sounds incredible. music/movies it feels like surround sound. for video conferencing the microphones are studio quality and you can tell - this is great for video conferencing. the keyboard is a dream to type on. very solid like all macbooks, no spongy feel you get with so many other laptops. the apple magic keyboard is the best - as is the track pad. battery life is amazing. i have gone all day on battery without needing to plug in. at best its spec says 17 hours, which is crazy! especially for this spec...but for real world use with a mix of tasks, it will not be 17 hours but i did a 9 hour session yesterday, and still had a ton of battery left. the power efficiency is ground breaking. they have added back the magsafe power plug - which is great! and added back an sd card slot and and an hdmi port - which many of us hated the previous macs that deleted these ports. i wish it had at least one usb-a old style port - but it does not. you get three usb-c thunderbolt 4 ports that you can use with adapters if needed. they got rid of the touch screen bar at the top of the keyboard from previous pro macbooks and put back the regular mechanical keys for the controls. apparently they listened to a lot of users who did not really like the touch pad. the shape and style of this laptop is great. some say the edge of the laptop looks ""sharp"" where your wrists rest. that is bs. i have been typing most of the day and i do not feel any issue with the edge of the laptop at all. very comfy for typing. some haters may try to find reasons to bash this new macbook pro, but i am telling you - from any perspective, all brand bias aside - this is an amazing laptop - the best apple has ever made, hands down. and i would say you will not find a better power laptop anywhere. all that said - this is not a gamers machine. apple is not for hard core gamers. i mean you can play games on it that you get from the app store. i am a hard core gamer and a pc geek - i have a powerful windows pc for gaming. and always will. but for everything else. this macbook is king. i use to for music, for photo and video editing, for productivity. i can plut into a giant monitor if i want a bigger screen - it works great on my 34 inch ips panel. so if you are wondering if this macbook 14 inch pro is the real deal or not - i am here to tell you, its the real deal. i finally upgraded from my 2015 macbook pro because this new one hits so many sweet spots - revolutionary power and battery life, excellent ergonomic design, great sound, stunning display - its the whole package. if you are thinking of getting one - you will not be disappointed. one last comment. i am an old timer windows guy, and i know all the counter arguments for the mac. many wills say this is overpriced compared to a windows laptop with similar spec. first, show me an intel based laptop that can match these new m1 pro chips - you cannot. and aside from that, the mac os is secure and stable - rock solid - and is intuitive with amazing features - like the ability to copy and paste text from a photo! whaaat?

4896,"i really wanted to love this laptop. i have had only macs for years. this was supposed to be an upgrade from my 2014 macbook air. i previously had a 2020 16"" intel based macbook pro for work configured with two hp monitors. no issues with the monitors and connected instantly with zero effort to get the screens to work with the laptop. bought this one and connected to my belkin hub for the hdmis. would only connect a single monitor. googled the issue and found that the new m1 apple chip only supports a single monitor. news to me and i guess i should have researched more. however the low rating stems from the fact that this is a pro laptop. a professional would want two monitors and should not have to google whether a pro laptop supports more than 1 monitor when the intel version does seamlessly. despite this i had planned to keep it and just deal with 1 monitor because of the cost savings over buying the intel based macbook pro and wanted the longer battery life. now brings me to the issue that made me return the laptop. this laptop just would not configure to show a clear resolution with my monitors. the scale was off and the display just stayed blurry no matter what setting i changed it to on the monitor or the laptop's settings. tried and tried and just gave up. returned this and ordered an intel based 13"" macbook pro. no issues, supports dual monitors, and seamlessly integrated to the laptop. no blurry screen and no having to set or change any settings to get it to work. i am floored that apple would produce a pro for business that only supports a single monitor. i love apple but will not buy anything with their chip until the kinks are worked out.",2/5,this was supposed to be an upgrade from my 2014 macbook air | despite this i had planned to keep it and just deal with 1 monitor because of the cost savings over buying the intel based macbook pro and wanted the longer battery life,0.0,"['', '']"

4901,"m1 pro chip is super powerful - photo/video editing, graphic design - this thing just kills it. compared to previous macbook pro, it is a giant leap ahead. these tasks are a main reason to buy the pro version of the macbook. this particularly model is the lower end of the spec you can get for a pro, but it still kicks butt. you can get the pro max chip and bump up the ram to 64gb if you want - and add tons more storage. the 14 inch macbook pro is the perfect size for a balance of portability and power. it can do pretty much everything the 16 inch version does. the display is stunning. just gorgeous. 120hz capability (pro motion) gets rid of blur when scrolling and makes for clearer action when viewing movies. the brightness and black levels on the display are awesome. real hdr viewing - a big difference. you will hear about ""the notch"" at the top of the screen where the camera is. after 10 minutes i do not even notice it. it means nothing for your experience. its just something critics have chosen to harp about. in most apps the notch is no even visible. camera is now a full 1080p and is a big upgrade over previous macbooks. six speaker sound system with new woofers - sounds incredible. music/movies it feels like surround sound. for video conferencing the microphones are studio quality and you can tell - this is great for video conferencing. the keyboard is a dream to type on. very solid like all macbooks, no spongy feel you get with so many other laptops. the apple magic keyboard is the best - as is the track pad. battery life is amazing. i have gone all day on battery without needing to plug in. at best its spec says 17 hours, which is crazy! especially for this spec...but for real world use with a mix of tasks, it will not be 17 hours but i did a 9 hour session yesterday, and still had a ton of battery left. the power efficiency is ground breaking. they have added back the magsafe power plug - which is great! and added back an sd card slot and and an hdmi port - which many of us hated the previous macs that deleted these ports. i wish it had at least one usb-a old style port - but it does not. you get three usb-c thunderbolt 4 ports that you can use with adapters if needed. they got rid of the touch screen bar at the top of the keyboard from previous pro macbooks and put back the regular mechanical keys for the controls. apparently they listened to a lot of users who did not really like the touch pad. the shape and style of this laptop is great. some say the edge of the laptop looks ""sharp"" where your wrists rest. that is bs. i have been typing most of the day and i do not feel any issue with the edge of the laptop at all. very comfy for typing. some haters may try to find reasons to bash this new macbook pro, but i am telling you - from any perspective, all brand bias aside - this is an amazing laptop - the best apple has ever made, hands down. and i would say you will not find a better power laptop anywhere. all that said - this is not a gamers machine. apple is not for hard core gamers. i mean you can play games on it that you get from the app store. i am a hard core gamer and a pc geek - i have a powerful windows pc for gaming. and always will. but for everything else. this macbook is king. i use to for music, for photo and video editing, for productivity. i can plut into a giant monitor if i want a bigger screen - it works great on my 34 inch ips panel. so if you are wondering if this macbook 14 inch pro is the real deal or not - i am here to tell you, its the real deal. i finally upgraded from my 2015 macbook pro because this new one hits so many sweet spots - revolutionary power and battery life, excellent ergonomic design, great sound, stunning display - its the whole package. if you are thinking of getting one - you will not be disappointed. one last comment. i am an old timer windows guy, and i know all the counter arguments for the mac. many wills say this is overpriced compared to a windows laptop with similar spec. first, show me an intel based laptop that can match these new m1 pro chips - you cannot. and aside from that, the mac os is secure and stable - rock solid - and is intuitive with amazing features - like the ability to copy and paste text from a photo! whaaat? and the design/ergonomics/quality of these macbooks is unmatched. so, yes you pay more - but you get more. my last macbook pro lasted me almost 7 years and it still works great. if you want this laptop - get it! it rocks.",5/5,"its just something critics have chosen to harp about | in most apps the notch is no even visible | i have been typing most of the day and i do not feel any issue with the edge of the laptop at all | and aside from that, the mac os is secure and stable - rock solid - and is intuitive with amazing features - like the ability to copy and paste text from a photo! whaaat?

4997,"i will put this first. i am unsure if the ram or solid state drive is set or if you can upgrade them. i did not try to open or upgrade the item. these are the two things you should research before purchasing this. although with the current specification, i am sure you do not need to do that. this acer laptop overall is an average size laptop and the specification are not bad for what you get. this laptop is relatively thin and not too heavy. it has a decent processor (ryzen 7). the ram is 16 gb which is well beyond the suggested nowadays. it will definitely work for most daily usage as well as design and gaming. that being said, it is not the best in terms of battery life. it really only last about three to four hours at most on a full charge. the fan is a bit loud on heavy usage. it is a standard ac charger which can make it a bit annoying to replace in the future if needed. the power brick is okay but does get hot while charging. you will need it plugged in to really game on this device. upon boot up of the acer laptop, the laptop boots up fairly quick. the setup is pretty straight forward and does not require any driver installation. the bloatware is not too terrible. the laptop also has only a 14 inch screen with the max resolution at 1920 x 1080. the screen has an okay brightness but not the best quality. it still keep the traditional two usb port as well so you do not have to buy an adapter for this laptop while also having the type c (non thunderbolt) port. the laptop can be angled back for better viewing but it cannot be pushed back all the way. the laptop surface where the wrist rest is where i do not like the material. it looks nice with the bright silver but with long term use it will fade over time. the keys are okay, but not the best. i am not a fan of typing on them as it just feels a bit on the cheaper end. the external casing of this surface is very easy to scratch (seems to be an issue with all this material) so i would recommend that you get a laptop case for it. the trackpad runs pretty well, it is sensitive and feels smooth to move across. it also does not look like it will wear down easily which is good. there is a camera that will record at at least 720p. you could put a web cam cover on it. the dual microphone makes for a very clear voice and i have not had any issues with any sound issues. it usually does not pick up too much surrounding noise and focuses more on voice. on laptop, there is a 3.5 port to plug in headphones/microphone. it does have dual band wifi built in and no issues with speed/connection. the laptop itself can last about five to six hours or so on a full charge. depending on how much you have open and how much you utilize the laptop capability, you could actually have less than that. best thing to do is just balance the resource as best you can. the overall charge time depends but it can take up to three to charge the laptop to 100% from what i can tell. it is not too long and the charger does get hot so handle with care. it has a decent boot up being less than fifteen seconds to boot up but the bloatware has to go so i would recommend you uninstall that if possible. the speaker system is pretty loud but they do have a bit of a feedback noise that is a bit annoying but that is okay. the 3060 ti runs great! it is a very powerful card that allows you to game very well on this computer although the screen is only 14 inches. the fan also is a bit loud on high usage (gaming). the processor is an ryzen 7 which is more than enough power for what i need it to do on a daily. in terms of video games, it can play many games at very high quality although you do need to have it plugged in. the processing speed is really fast and it works really well for what i need. there is an hdmi port so you are able to connect this to an external screen. i am unsure if there is a dock that is meant for this laptop. overall this laptop is a a very powerful laptop. you get a smaller screen but the gaming on it is not bad. the acer laptop can run a bit hot and the battery life is not the best. the specification is not bad at 16 gb ram and 512 gb ssd drive. the space is decent for what i need it for but for gaming it will fill up fast. it is good for all around use and can easily be made into a work, gaming, or basic computer with a single monitor connection.",5/5,"it will definitely work for most daily usage as well as design and gaming | it really only last about three to four hours at most on a full charge | the trackpad runs pretty well, it is sensitive and feels smooth to move across | it has a decent boot up being less than fifteen seconds to boot up but the bloatware has to go so i would recommend you uninstall that if possible",0.16,"['', '', 'sensitive smooth', '']"

5101,"usually when you get a laptop for this price you expect the laptop to be a little on the slower side especially since most laptops today have 16 gb of memory. this laptop comes with 8 gb of memory soldered in and the laptop will accept another 8 gb of memory which is on order. this is surprisingly fast for only 8 gigs of memory. i had no issues with downloads, apps watching movies or downloading about 250 gb of data from my one drive. the laptop boots up in about 20 seconds. really does not need anything else for my use. might not be enough for gaming but should be kind of decent. my one big complaint about this laptop is the touch panel and keyboard is off center, they did this to put in a number pad which is nice feature. the problem is that on the touch pad while i am trying to click on the item, i keep on right clicking on the item. also, when i put my hands on the keyboard, i sometimes am off by one position and have to reset my hand. i am sure i will overcome the keyboard but the touchpad i am having a hard time with. so, besides the 8gb of memory ordered i ordered a 1 tb ssd drive. i hate one drive i am old schooled i love having items on my computer and being fast. one drive is very clunky but is very usefull for not loosing data when the hard drive goes or for this instance when i got a new computer. it was painless to transfer everything over. for wifi connectivity the router is upstairs and i am in the room directly below and getting speeds of 400 mbps which is really fast. sitting next to the router i have hit average speed of 639 download and peak of just over 700 using speedtest. my macbook is not even doing that. the laptop is really light and feels just a touch flimsy there is almost no flex in the base part and screen does not flex opening and closing. if you grab both ends of the top of the screen you can get it to flex. not a deal breaker at this price point and i really love the laptop. i have had a dell and also an hp laptop at this price point in the past and was alway disappointed and by upgrading was happy. this one many years later which should be costing several hundred dollars more due to inflation but got at the same price as both of them ($500) is quite the bargain. i did not get to test other laptops at this price point but i know this is quite a deal. you will not be disappointed and even though i ordered more memory and a bigger ssd the laptop is pretty good just the way it is. i will upgrade to see if i see any more improvements in speed with the ram. it never hurts to have more. bonus this has windows 11 pro.",5/5,"usually when you get a laptop for this price you expect the laptop to be a little on the slower side especially since most laptops today have 16 gb of memory | also, when i put my hands on the keyboard, i sometimes am off by one position and have to reset my hand | one drive is very clunky but is very usefull for not loosing data when the hard drive goes or for this instance when i got a new computer | the laptop is really light and feels just a touch flimsy there is almost no flex in the base part and screen does not flex opening and closing | this one many years later which should be costing several hundred dollars more due to inflation but got at the same price as both of them ($500) is quite the bargain",0.05,"['', '', 'very very clunky usefull', 'touch really light flimsy', '']"

5217,"this is my first laptop after a decade and i am very happy to purchase this one. so many good words about nitro 5s, even this one is not one of the better ones, i added another 8gb ram and 2 tb 2.5 ssd to make it bit more usable. not that anything wrong with 8gb ram and 256gb ssd but 8gb rams are not that expensive at all these days.. i had 2tb ssd from my big computer, just switched it over. talking about upgrading the laptop, it is so easy. comes with everything you need to add another 2.5 ssd. youtube videos helped me out though, made my job a lot easier. this computer does play fps games, and plays them very smooth. the fans start running though, and you might think it is overheating, that is not the case, it is normal. they do not go full speed. i also play mobile games and stream through laptop... no heating no fan issues at all... it is like so smooth and easy for the machine. for this price, i highly recommend it, if you are in a tight budged like i am. one more thing for this laptop, i am going to travel europe next year, and it will not be problem bringing it with me, since it is travel friendly :)",5/5,"youtube videos helped me out though, made my job a lot easier",0.0,['']
5224,"i will put this first. i am unsure if the ram or solid state drive is set or if you can upgrade them. i did not try to open or upgrade the item. these are the two things you should research before purchasing this. although with the current specification, i am sure you do not need to do that. this acer laptop overall is an average size laptop and the specification are not bad for what you get. this laptop is relatively thin and not too heavy. it has a decent processor (ryzen 7). the ram is 16 gb which is well beyond the suggested nowadays. it will definitely work for most daily usage as well as design and gaming. that being said, it is not the best in terms of battery life. it really only last about three to four hours at most on a full charge. the fan is a bit loud on heavy usage. it is a standard ac charger which can make it a bit annoying to replace in the future if needed. the power brick is okay but does get hot while charging. you will need it plugged in to really game on this device. upon boot up of the acer laptop, the laptop boots up fairly quick. the setup is pretty straight forward and does not require any driver installation. the bloatware is not too terrible. the laptop also has only a 14 inch screen with the max resolution at 1920 x 1080. the screen has an okay brightness but not the best quality. it still keep the traditional two usb port as well so you do not have to buy an adapter for this laptop while also having the type c (non thunderbolt) port. the laptop can be angled back for better viewing but it cannot be pushed back all the way. the laptop surface where the wrist rest is where i do not like the material. it looks nice with the bright silver but with long term use it will fade over time. the keys are okay, but not the best. i am not a fan of typing on them as it just feels a bit on the cheaper end. the external casing of this surface is very easy to scratch (seems to be an issue with all this material) so i would recommend that you get a laptop case for it. the trackpad runs pretty well, it is sensitive and feels smooth to move across. it also does not look like it will wear down easily which is good. there is a camera that will record at at least 720p. you could put a web cam cover on it. the dual microphone makes for a very clear voice and i have not had any issues with any sound issues. it usually does not pick up too much surrounding noise and focuses more on voice. on laptop, there is a 3.5 port to plug in headphones/microphone. it does have dual band wifi built in and no issues with speed/connection. the laptop itself can last about five to six hours or so on a full charge. depending on how much you have open and how much you utilize the laptop capability, you could actually have less than that. best thing to do is just balance the resource as best you can. the overall charge time depends but it can take up to three to charge the laptop to 100% from what i can tell. it is not too long and the charger does get hot so handle with care. it has a decent boot up being less than fifteen seconds to boot up but the bloatware has to go so i would recommend you uninstall that if possible. the speaker system is pretty loud but they do have a bit of a feedback noise that is a bit annoying but that is okay. the 3060 ti runs great! it is a very powerful card that allows you to game very well on this computer although the screen is only 14 inches. the fan also is a bit loud on high usage (gaming). the processor is an ryzen 7 which is more than enough power for what i need it to do on a daily. in terms of video games, it can play many games at very high quality although you do need to have it plugged in. the processing speed is really fast and it works really well for what i need. there is an hdmi port so you are able to connect this to an external screen. i am unsure if there is a dock that is meant for this laptop. overall this laptop is a a very powerful laptop. you get a smaller screen but the gaming on it is not bad. the acer laptop can run a bit hot and the battery life is not the best. the specification is not bad at 16 gb ram and 512 gb ssd drive. the space is decent for what i need it for but for gaming it will fill up fast. it is good for all around use and can easily be made into a work, gaming, or basic computer with a single monitor connection.",5/5,"it will definitely work for most daily usage as well as design and gaming | it really only last about three to four hours at most on a full charge | the trackpad runs pretty well, it is sensitive and feels smooth to move across | it has a decent boot up being less than fifteen seconds to boot up but the bloatware has to go so i would recommend you uninstall that if possible",0.16,"['', '', 'sensitive smooth', '']"

5244,"this does not have touch screen on my model. the fhd display really surprised me. it is better picture than a lot of these tvs. as with all products they hide the defects from you until a month later. as soon as the 33th day rolled on i turned on the laptop and discovered sure enough it is got a burnt pixel. no way to fix that without replacing the screen. unless you have 5+ burned out pixels, good luck getting a return or any repairs. hp is still shady in that regard. i fully upgraded the machine when i got it. 16gb ram, 1tb samsung 980 ssd. the performance actually is comparable to my tower in many respects. i have a geforce 980, an octocore amd cpu, and 24gb ddr3 ram in my tower. this laptop of course has a little less ram, but it plays games about just as well as on my tower. i really am surprised at this. the cooling situation is absolutely garbage with this laptop. the engineers put the cpu exhaust port pointing directly into the hinge portion of the case. this makes it so the computer is actively fighting by blowing air into a 1/5 cm gap. there is just a row of holes in the bottle for air intake. i picked up a tray with a cooling fan pad and that solved the heat problem. i see it having problems in the future just because of how they designed the fan. the excess heat not only kills your hardware lifespan but it slows your machine down by auto throttling. if i could i would have installed heat spreaders all over the inside of this machine, but there just is not room. they could not even be bothered to make the air inlets in the front of the case. it is asking to burn up after so many years deliberately. i had problems with hp in the past, they screwed up a laptop return i sent in, then blamed me for water damage when i had before and after pictures, so i am not shocked at how they treat customers. i swore i would not buy another hp but this one was just too cheap to pass up. it is super light weight. the camera is nothing fancy, in windows 11, you will find you lack all of your audio enhancement options. it is instead been replaced by this crap hp audio tool. ditch it as soon as you can and find something like pulse audio so you can hear out of the cheap cheap cheap dog szzz cheap speakers. you will also want to get a good set of headphones. the performance is a little low unless you do add that second stick of ram as so many other people have pointed out. the machine simply was not designed properly, and they are taking it out of the consumers pocket by keeping them ignorant and not showing important aspects such as showing how the fan is smack dab in the middle of a 1/2cm gap. when you close the lid and open it after 20 minutes you will find it is incredibly warm if you have it hooked up to hdmi. it forces you to keep the screen open, which is not good to have static screens. i honestly think the burned out pixel happened just from the excess heat, but there is not anything i can do about it. it is not that bad, but once you see something you can never unsee it. i have a warranty but again, it is not going to cover this damage, so i spent money and not even 30 days later it has depreciated in value by the price of the lcd screen. the case is the cheapest plastic they could find. given this was produced during the pandemic you are left with another problem. check your ram speeds. if you get stuck with a 1r16 chip you are basically having 1 librarian trying to organize 16 shelves, whereas the good ram 2r8 would be equal to 2 librarians keeping up with 8 shelves. now you can see how the extra work load slows your machine. they do not mention this in their sales page or documentation, and you will only find out after you get it and run software to look at it, or pull the machine apart. overall, i probably would not buy this machine again, even though it works fast for an entry level computer. it is just too poorly designed. i give it a year or two before it fails. most likely, knowing hp it will be 26 minutes after the oem warranty expires. they used this planned obsolescence to rip off customers, and even though it is been nearly 8 years since i swore i would not buy another one, they changed; for the worse.",4/5,"when you close the lid and open it after 20 minutes you will find it is incredibly warm if you have it hooked up to hdmi | they do not mention this in their sales page or documentation, and you will only find out after you get it and run software to look at it, or pull the machine apart | most likely, knowing hp it will be 26 minutes after the oem warranty expires",0.22,"['incredibly warm', '', '']"

5342,"m1 pro chip is super powerful - photo/video editing, graphic design - this thing just kills it. compared to previous macbook pro, it is a giant leap ahead. these tasks are a main reason to buy the pro version of the macbook. this particularly model is the lower end of the spec you can get for a pro, but it still kicks butt. you can get the pro max chip and bump up the ram to 64gb if you want - and add tons more storage. the 14 inch macbook pro is the perfect size for a balance of portability and power. it can do pretty much everything the 16 inch version does. the display is stunning. just gorgeous. 120hz capability (pro motion) gets rid of blur when scrolling and makes for clearer action when viewing movies. the brightness and black levels on the display are awesome. real hdr viewing - a big difference. you will hear about ""the notch"" at the top of the screen where the camera is. after 10 minutes i do not even notice it. it means nothing for your experience. its just something critics have chosen to harp about. in most apps the notch is no even visible. camera is now a full 1080p and is a big upgrade over previous macbooks. six speaker sound system with new woofers - sounds incredible. music/movies it feels like surround sound. for video conferencing the microphones are studio quality and you can tell - this is great for video conferencing. the keyboard is a dream to type on. very solid like all macbooks, no spongy feel you get with so many other laptops. the apple magic keyboard is the best - as is the track pad. battery life is amazing. i have gone all day on battery without needing to plug in. at best its spec says 17 hours, which is crazy! especially for this spec...but for real world use with a mix of tasks, it will not be 17 hours but i did a 9 hour session yesterday, and still had a ton of battery left. the power efficiency is ground breaking. they have added back the magsafe power plug - which is great! and added back an sd card slot and and an hdmi port - which many of us hated the previous macs that deleted these ports. i wish it had at least one usb-a old style port - but it does not. you get three usb-c thunderbolt 4 ports that you can use with adapters if needed. they got rid of the touch screen bar at the top of the keyboard from previous pro macbooks and put back the regular mechanical keys for the controls. apparently they listened to a lot of users who did not really like the touch pad. the shape and style of this laptop is great. some say the edge of the laptop looks ""sharp"" where your wrists rest. that is bs. i have been typing most of the day and i do not feel any issue with the edge of the laptop at all. very comfy for typing. some haters may try to find reasons to bash this new macbook pro, but i am telling you - from any perspective, all brand bias aside - this is an amazing laptop - the best apple has ever made, hands down. and i would say you will not find a better power laptop anywhere. all that said - this is not a gamers machine. apple is not for hard core gamers. i mean you can play games on it that you get from the app store. i am a hard core gamer and a pc geek - i have a powerful windows pc for gaming. and always will. but for everything else. this macbook is king. i use to for music, for photo and video editing, for productivity. i can plut into a giant monitor if i want a bigger screen - it works great on my 34 inch ips panel. so if you are wondering if this macbook 14 inch pro is the real deal or not - i am here to tell you, its the real deal. i finally upgraded from my 2015 macbook pro because this new one hits so many sweet spots - revolutionary power and battery life, excellent ergonomic design, great sound, stunning display - its the whole package. if you are thinking of getting one - you will not be disappointed. one last comment. i am an old timer windows guy, and i know all the counter arguments for the mac. many wills say this is overpriced compared to a windows laptop with similar spec. first, show me an intel based laptop that can match these new m1 pro chips - you cannot. and aside from that, the mac os is secure and stable - rock solid - and is intuitive with amazing features - like the ability to copy and paste text from a photo! whaaat?

5594,"m1 pro chip is super powerful - photo/video editing, graphic design - this thing just kills it. compared to previous macbook pro, it is a giant leap ahead. these tasks are a main reason to buy the pro version of the macbook. this particularly model is the lower end of the spec you can get for a pro, but it still kicks butt. you can get the pro max chip and bump up the ram to 64gb if you want - and add tons more storage. the 14 inch macbook pro is the perfect size for a balance of portability and power. it can do pretty much everything the 16 inch version does. the display is stunning. just gorgeous. 120hz capability (pro motion) gets rid of blur when scrolling and makes for clearer action when viewing movies. the brightness and black levels on the display are awesome. real hdr viewing - a big difference. you will hear about ""the notch"" at the top of the screen where the camera is. after 10 minutes i do not even notice it. it means nothing for your experience. its just something critics have chosen to harp about. in most apps the notch is no even visible. camera is now a full 1080p and is a big upgrade over previous macbooks. six speaker sound system with new woofers - sounds incredible. music/movies it feels like surround sound. for video conferencing the microphones are studio quality and you can tell - this is great for video conferencing. the keyboard is a dream to type on. very solid like all macbooks, no spongy feel you get with so many other laptops. the apple magic keyboard is the best - as is the track pad. battery life is amazing. i have gone all day on battery without needing to plug in. at best its spec says 17 hours, which is crazy! especially for this spec...but for real world use with a mix of tasks, it will not be 17 hours but i did a 9 hour session yesterday, and still had a ton of battery left. the power efficiency is ground breaking. they have added back the magsafe power plug - which is great! and added back an sd card slot and and an hdmi port - which many of us hated the previous macs that deleted these ports. i wish it had at least one usb-a old style port - but it does not. you get three usb-c thunderbolt 4 ports that you can use with adapters if needed. they got rid of the touch screen bar at the top of the keyboard from previous pro macbooks and put back the regular mechanical keys for the controls. apparently they listened to a lot of users who did not really like the touch pad. the shape and style of this laptop is great. some say the edge of the laptop looks ""sharp"" where your wrists rest. that is bs. i have been typing most of the day and i do not feel any issue with the edge of the laptop at all. very comfy for typing. some haters may try to find reasons to bash this new macbook pro, but i am telling you - from any perspective, all brand bias aside - this is an amazing laptop - the best apple has ever made, hands down. and i would say you will not find a better power laptop anywhere. all that said - this is not a gamers machine. apple is not for hard core gamers. i mean you can play games on it that you get from the app store. i am a hard core gamer and a pc geek - i have a powerful windows pc for gaming. and always will. but for everything else. this macbook is king. i use to for music, for photo and video editing, for productivity. i can plut into a giant monitor if i want a bigger screen - it works great on my 34 inch ips panel. so if you are wondering if this macbook 14 inch pro is the real deal or not - i am here to tell you, its the real deal. i finally upgraded from my 2015 macbook pro because this new one hits so many sweet spots - revolutionary power and battery life, excellent ergonomic design, great sound, stunning display - its the whole package. if you are thinking of getting one - you will not be disappointed. one last comment. i am an old timer windows guy, and i know all the counter arguments for the mac. many wills say this is overpriced compared to a windows laptop with similar spec. first, show me an intel based laptop that can match these new m1 pro chips - you cannot. and aside from that, the mac os is secure and stable - rock solid - and is intuitive with amazing features - like the ability to copy and paste text from a photo! whaaat?

5693,"this does not have touch screen on my model. the fhd display really surprised me. it is better picture than a lot of these tvs. as with all products they hide the defects from you until a month later. as soon as the 33th day rolled on i turned on the laptop and discovered sure enough it is got a burnt pixel. no way to fix that without replacing the screen. unless you have 5+ burned out pixels, good luck getting a return or any repairs. hp is still shady in that regard. i fully upgraded the machine when i got it. 16gb ram, 1tb samsung 980 ssd. the performance actually is comparable to my tower in many respects. i have a geforce 980, an octocore amd cpu, and 24gb ddr3 ram in my tower. this laptop of course has a little less ram, but it plays games about just as well as on my tower. i really am surprised at this. the cooling situation is absolutely garbage with this laptop. the engineers put the cpu exhaust port pointing directly into the hinge portion of the case. this makes it so the computer is actively fighting by blowing air into a 1/5 cm gap. there is just a row of holes in the bottle for air intake. i picked up a tray with a cooling fan pad and that solved the heat problem. i see it having problems in the future just because of how they designed the fan. the excess heat not only kills your hardware lifespan but it slows your machine down by auto throttling. if i could i would have installed heat spreaders all over the inside of this machine, but there just is not room. they could not even be bothered to make the air inlets in the front of the case. it is asking to burn up after so many years deliberately. i had problems with hp in the past, they screwed up a laptop return i sent in, then blamed me for water damage when i had before and after pictures, so i am not shocked at how they treat customers. i swore i would not buy another hp but this one was just too cheap to pass up. it is super light weight. the camera is nothing fancy, in windows 11, you will find you lack all of your audio enhancement options. it is instead been replaced by this crap hp audio tool. ditch it as soon as you can and find something like pulse audio so you can hear out of the cheap cheap cheap dog szzz cheap speakers. you will also want to get a good set of headphones. the performance is a little low unless you do add that second stick of ram as so many other people have pointed out. the machine simply was not designed properly, and they are taking it out of the consumers pocket by keeping them ignorant and not showing important aspects such as showing how the fan is smack dab in the middle of a 1/2cm gap. when you close the lid and open it after 20 minutes you will find it is incredibly warm if you have it hooked up to hdmi. it forces you to keep the screen open, which is not good to have static screens. i honestly think the burned out pixel happened just from the excess heat, but there is not anything i can do about it. it is not that bad, but once you see something you can never unsee it. i have a warranty but again, it is not going to cover this damage, so i spent money and not even 30 days later it has depreciated in value by the price of the lcd screen. the case is the cheapest plastic they could find. given this was produced during the pandemic you are left with another problem. check your ram speeds. if you get stuck with a 1r16 chip you are basically having 1 librarian trying to organize 16 shelves, whereas the good ram 2r8 would be equal to 2 librarians keeping up with 8 shelves. now you can see how the extra work load slows your machine. they do not mention this in their sales page or documentation, and you will only find out after you get it and run software to look at it, or pull the machine apart. overall, i probably would not buy this machine again, even though it works fast for an entry level computer. it is just too poorly designed. i give it a year or two before it fails. most likely, knowing hp it will be 26 minutes after the oem warranty expires. they used this planned obsolescence to rip off customers, and even though it is been nearly 8 years since i swore i would not buy another one, they changed; for the worse.",4/5,"when you close the lid and open it after 20 minutes you will find it is incredibly warm if you have it hooked up to hdmi | they do not mention this in their sales page or documentation, and you will only find out after you get it and run software to look at it, or pull the machine apart | most likely, knowing hp it will be 26 minutes after the oem warranty expires",0.22,"['incredibly warm', '', '']"

5918,"m1 pro chip is super powerful - photo/video editing, graphic design - this thing just kills it. compared to previous macbook pro, it is a giant leap ahead. these tasks are a main reason to buy the pro version of the macbook. this particularly model is the lower end of the spec you can get for a pro, but it still kicks butt. you can get the pro max chip and bump up the ram to 64gb if you want - and add tons more storage. the 14 inch macbook pro is the perfect size for a balance of portability and power. it can do pretty much everything the 16 inch version does. the display is stunning. just gorgeous. 120hz capability (pro motion) gets rid of blur when scrolling and makes for clearer action when viewing movies. the brightness and black levels on the display are awesome. real hdr viewing - a big difference. you will hear about ""the notch"" at the top of the screen where the camera is. after 10 minutes i do not even notice it. it means nothing for your experience. its just something critics have chosen to harp about. in most apps the notch is no even visible. camera is now a full 1080p and is a big upgrade over previous macbooks. six speaker sound system with new woofers - sounds incredible. music/movies it feels like surround sound. for video conferencing the microphones are studio quality and you can tell - this is great for video conferencing. the keyboard is a dream to type on. very solid like all macbooks, no spongy feel you get with so many other laptops. the apple magic keyboard is the best - as is the track pad. battery life is amazing. i have gone all day on battery without needing to plug in. at best its spec says 17 hours, which is crazy! especially for this spec...but for real world use with a mix of tasks, it will not be 17 hours but i did a 9 hour session yesterday, and still had a ton of battery left. the power efficiency is ground breaking. they have added back the magsafe power plug - which is great! and added back an sd card slot and and an hdmi port - which many of us hated the previous macs that deleted these ports. i wish it had at least one usb-a old style port - but it does not. you get three usb-c thunderbolt 4 ports that you can use with adapters if needed. they got rid of the touch screen bar at the top of the keyboard from previous pro macbooks and put back the regular mechanical keys for the controls. apparently they listened to a lot of users who did not really like the touch pad. the shape and style of this laptop is great. some say the edge of the laptop looks ""sharp"" where your wrists rest. that is bs. i have been typing most of the day and i do not feel any issue with the edge of the laptop at all. very comfy for typing. some haters may try to find reasons to bash this new macbook pro, but i am telling you - from any perspective, all brand bias aside - this is an amazing laptop - the best apple has ever made, hands down. and i would say you will not find a better power laptop anywhere. all that said - this is not a gamers machine. apple is not for hard core gamers. i mean you can play games on it that you get from the app store. i am a hard core gamer and a pc geek - i have a powerful windows pc for gaming. and always will. but for everything else. this macbook is king. i use to for music, for photo and video editing, for productivity. i can plut into a giant monitor if i want a bigger screen - it works great on my 34 inch ips panel. so if you are wondering if this macbook 14 inch pro is the real deal or not - i am here to tell you, its the real deal. i finally upgraded from my 2015 macbook pro because this new one hits so many sweet spots - revolutionary power and battery life, excellent ergonomic design, great sound, stunning display - its the whole package. if you are thinking of getting one - you will not be disappointed. one last comment. i am an old timer windows guy, and i know all the counter arguments for the mac. many wills say this is overpriced compared to a windows laptop with similar spec. first, show me an intel based laptop that can match these new m1 pro chips - you cannot. and aside from that, the mac os is secure and stable - rock solid - and is intuitive with amazing features - like the ability to copy and paste text from a photo! whaaat?

6583,"i will put this first. i am unsure if the ram or solid state drive is set or if you can upgrade them. i did not try to open or upgrade the item. these are the two things you should research before purchasing this. although with the current specification, i am sure you do not need to do that. this acer laptop overall is an average size laptop and the specification are not bad for what you get. this laptop is relatively thin and not too heavy. it has a decent processor (ryzen 7). the ram is 16 gb which is well beyond the suggested nowadays. it will definitely work for most daily usage as well as design and gaming. that being said, it is not the best in terms of battery life. it really only last about three to four hours at most on a full charge. the fan is a bit loud on heavy usage. it is a standard ac charger which can make it a bit annoying to replace in the future if needed. the power brick is okay but does get hot while charging. you will need it plugged in to really game on this device. upon boot up of the acer laptop, the laptop boots up fairly quick. the setup is pretty straight forward and does not require any driver installation. the bloatware is not too terrible. the laptop also has only a 14 inch screen with the max resolution at 1920 x 1080. the screen has an okay brightness but not the best quality. it still keep the traditional two usb port as well so you do not have to buy an adapter for this laptop while also having the type c (non thunderbolt) port. the laptop can be angled back for better viewing but it cannot be pushed back all the way. the laptop surface where the wrist rest is where i do not like the material. it looks nice with the bright silver but with long term use it will fade over time. the keys are okay, but not the best. i am not a fan of typing on them as it just feels a bit on the cheaper end. the external casing of this surface is very easy to scratch (seems to be an issue with all this material) so i would recommend that you get a laptop case for it. the trackpad runs pretty well, it is sensitive and feels smooth to move across. it also does not look like it will wear down easily which is good. there is a camera that will record at at least 720p. you could put a web cam cover on it. the dual microphone makes for a very clear voice and i have not had any issues with any sound issues. it usually does not pick up too much surrounding noise and focuses more on voice. on laptop, there is a 3.5 port to plug in headphones/microphone. it does have dual band wifi built in and no issues with speed/connection. the laptop itself can last about five to six hours or so on a full charge. depending on how much you have open and how much you utilize the laptop capability, you could actually have less than that. best thing to do is just balance the resource as best you can. the overall charge time depends but it can take up to three to charge the laptop to 100% from what i can tell. it is not too long and the charger does get hot so handle with care. it has a decent boot up being less than fifteen seconds to boot up but the bloatware has to go so i would recommend you uninstall that if possible. the speaker system is pretty loud but they do have a bit of a feedback noise that is a bit annoying but that is okay. the 3060 ti runs great! it is a very powerful card that allows you to game very well on this computer although the screen is only 14 inches. the fan also is a bit loud on high usage (gaming). the processor is an ryzen 7 which is more than enough power for what i need it to do on a daily. in terms of video games, it can play many games at very high quality although you do need to have it plugged in. the processing speed is really fast and it works really well for what i need. there is an hdmi port so you are able to connect this to an external screen. i am unsure if there is a dock that is meant for this laptop. overall this laptop is a a very powerful laptop. you get a smaller screen but the gaming on it is not bad. the acer laptop can run a bit hot and the battery life is not the best. the specification is not bad at 16 gb ram and 512 gb ssd drive. the space is decent for what i need it for but for gaming it will fill up fast. it is good for all around use and can easily be made into a work, gaming, or basic computer with a single monitor connection.",5/5,"it will definitely work for most daily usage as well as design and gaming | it really only last about three to four hours at most on a full charge | the trackpad runs pretty well, it is sensitive and feels smooth to move across | it has a decent boot up being less than fifteen seconds to boot up but the bloatware has to go so i would recommend you uninstall that if possible",0.16,"['', '', 'sensitive smooth', '']"

6948,"i will put this first. i am unsure if the ram or solid state drive is set or if you can upgrade them. i did not try to open or upgrade the item. these are the two things you should research before purchasing this. although with the current specification, i am sure you do not need to do that. this acer laptop overall is an average size laptop and the specification are not bad for what you get. this laptop is relatively thin and not too heavy. it has a decent processor (ryzen 7). the ram is 16 gb which is well beyond the suggested nowadays. it will definitely work for most daily usage as well as design and gaming. that being said, it is not the best in terms of battery life. it really only last about three to four hours at most on a full charge. the fan is a bit loud on heavy usage. it is a standard ac charger which can make it a bit annoying to replace in the future if needed. the power brick is okay but does get hot while charging. you will need it plugged in to really game on this device. upon boot up of the acer laptop, the laptop boots up fairly quick. the setup is pretty straight forward and does not require any driver installation. the bloatware is not too terrible. the laptop also has only a 14 inch screen with the max resolution at 1920 x 1080. the screen has an okay brightness but not the best quality. it still keep the traditional two usb port as well so you do not have to buy an adapter for this laptop while also having the type c (non thunderbolt) port. the laptop can be angled back for better viewing but it cannot be pushed back all the way. the laptop surface where the wrist rest is where i do not like the material. it looks nice with the bright silver but with long term use it will fade over time. the keys are okay, but not the best. i am not a fan of typing on them as it just feels a bit on the cheaper end. the external casing of this surface is very easy to scratch (seems to be an issue with all this material) so i would recommend that you get a laptop case for it. the trackpad runs pretty well, it is sensitive and feels smooth to move across. it also does not look like it will wear down easily which is good. there is a camera that will record at at least 720p. you could put a web cam cover on it. the dual microphone makes for a very clear voice and i have not had any issues with any sound issues. it usually does not pick up too much surrounding noise and focuses more on voice. on laptop, there is a 3.5 port to plug in headphones/microphone. it does have dual band wifi built in and no issues with speed/connection. the laptop itself can last about five to six hours or so on a full charge. depending on how much you have open and how much you utilize the laptop capability, you could actually have less than that. best thing to do is just balance the resource as best you can. the overall charge time depends but it can take up to three to charge the laptop to 100% from what i can tell. it is not too long and the charger does get hot so handle with care. it has a decent boot up being less than fifteen seconds to boot up but the bloatware has to go so i would recommend you uninstall that if possible. the speaker system is pretty loud but they do have a bit of a feedback noise that is a bit annoying but that is okay. the 3060 ti runs great! it is a very powerful card that allows you to game very well on this computer although the screen is only 14 inches. the fan also is a bit loud on high usage (gaming). the processor is an ryzen 7 which is more than enough power for what i need it to do on a daily. in terms of video games, it can play many games at very high quality although you do need to have it plugged in. the processing speed is really fast and it works really well for what i need. there is an hdmi port so you are able to connect this to an external screen. i am unsure if there is a dock that is meant for this laptop. overall this laptop is a a very powerful laptop. you get a smaller screen but the gaming on it is not bad. the acer laptop can run a bit hot and the battery life is not the best. the specification is not bad at 16 gb ram and 512 gb ssd drive. the space is decent for what i need it for but for gaming it will fill up fast. it is good for all around use and can easily be made into a work, gaming, or basic computer with a single monitor connection.",5/5,"it will definitely work for most daily usage as well as design and gaming | it really only last about three to four hours at most on a full charge | the trackpad runs pretty well, it is sensitive and feels smooth to move across | it has a decent boot up being less than fifteen seconds to boot up but the bloatware has to go so i would recommend you uninstall that if possible",0.16,"['', '', 'sensitive smooth', '']"
