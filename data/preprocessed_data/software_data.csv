91,"i will go straight to the point here, at the retail price of $350 you are mostly getting a nice display. | the rest is probably going to be unacceptable to anyone looking for a decent level of performance to do...well mostly anything. | word processing, spreadsheets, internet browsing, and youtube videos/tv streaming are what this laptop is mainly geared for. | the only way you are really going to open up the possibilities for this laptop is to, as other reviews suggest, get out of windows s mode, and invest in adding more ram and installing a second 2.5"" ssd. | all of these things can be done fairly easily by most people and acer even has videos online that show you how to handle the hardware part. | i ended up spending an additional $120 for 2 sticks of 8 gb ram and a 1tb ssd so my total cost (after black friday deal) was just under $380.",Positive

112,"i was hoping to write a positive review based on functionality, but cannot. | the sole purpose of buying was for them to do their online school work, coding and some gaming. | there are other functionality issues too, but i could have worked around those. | also, if you decide to delete family link and no longer use the device, you will lose the email address you had to create to use the device.",Positive
113,"if you do not want to open the laptop to upgrade at all, just note the single 4gb of ram is fine for web browsing and running lightweight programs and some older games.",Positive
114,"the only thing i do not like is that the keys are a shiny silver and the letters on the keys are very hard to see and they are very close together so i make a lot of typing errors unless i have the keyboard angled a certain way. | have not tried doing any spreadsheets or graphs yet, this is mostly for entertainment, checking email and uploading pictures!",Positive

128,"i use it mainly for word processing, and for those purposes it gets the job done nicely. | those are pretty much the most important features for me. | if i had to nitpick i would say that i do not like that the acer logo is so prominent in the bezel, or that it says corning gorilla glass at the top of the screen--i do not need logos and type drawing my focus when i am on task.",Positive
