10,okay i will start with the good about apple.. my daughters last laptop lasted 10 years(2 batteries and the pad cracked).. started failing.. we bought her this new 2022 macbook air laptop m2.. it weighs very little like a heavy cell phone.. also does not heat up as much.. so far has worked just like her last one so far pretty good.. the new operating system software made it impossible to move her office products over so she put in libreoffice which is free and it mimics office pretty well.. it uses usb 4 thunderbolt ports and you have to buy adapters to use usb drives etc.. they are pretty cheap so not a big problem.. there is a new 1 tb flash drive for a good price(30$) on amazon right now.. adds storage and backup.. has dual usb 3 and 4 which will work on this laptop.. usb 4 is thunderbolt.. if you like apple and need new laptop for 1200 bucks you should get this one..,Positive
