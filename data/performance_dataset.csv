17,"omg! this is such an incredible product. perfect keyboard, perfect weight, perfect battery life, perfect trackpad, perfect performance, perfect touch id, perfect feel, perfect build, perfect look, perfect size, perfect stereo sound, perfect screen, perfect noise absence as not having a fan! i mean, it does not have a fan and it does not get hot most of the times. wtf?! it is the only laptop i have been able to use in my bed for x amount of hours and it is sooo comfortable to do it. it truly is one of the best products out there and it is totally worth the investment, because that is how i see it, not even as spending, that is just how good it is. i am enthusiastic because this is for sure the best device apple has created in terms of price/what you get, and it will probably stay in that position for a couple of years. this is game-changing and revolutionary. the computer feels as if it will last 10+ years, honestly. i highly recommend it. btw, it is so good my girlfriend decided to get one for herself because she just could not get over the first time she used it, and just how beautiful it is and pleasurable to look at from any perspective... this laptop is so ridiculously perfect that you can even open it with one hand and in just a couple of seconds, you will be ready to use it as it has an always-on feature that allows you to get down to the working right away. that is probably the best feat. true tone is also really good, as it is automatic brightness adjustment and dark mode, they sit together perfectly well. get it! you will not regret it at any moment. truly a high-end experience. oh, and... it looks elegant at any angle, and which is most important, classy it feels.",5/5,"perfect keyboard, perfect weight, perfect battery life, perfect trackpad, perfect performance, perfect touch id, perfect feel, perfect build, perfect look, perfect size, perfect stereo sound, perfect screen, perfect noise absence as not having a fan! i mean, it does not have a fan and it does not get hot most of the times",0.77,['perfect']

26,"i am a life-long fan of all things apple. that being said, after using this laptop for a little over a month, i am still impressed with how awesome this laptop is! the battery life alone leaves me in awe. i bought this laptop to use as an online student. starting with the battery fully charged, i am easily able to complete all of my online coursework and have plenty of battery power left to stream a movie or two afterwards. i actually purchased my macbook air m1 laptop directly from apple so i would get the student discount. i did choose to upgrade my ram to the 16 gb for an additional $180, and that did cause delivery to take a little longer. totally worth it though! i have not done anything yet on this laptop to really stress-test it, but i have had multiple webpages in the browser, and multiple documents open in word and pdf docs open with ibooks and preview. i have had no problems at all switching between open web sites, apps, or docs. the only time i started to notice any hint of a problem, it turns out it was because we lost power and therefore our home wifi was temporarily unavailable, so it had nothing to do with the laptop.",5/5,"i did choose to upgrade my ram to the 16 gb for an additional $180, and that did cause delivery to take a little longer",-0.19,['']

42,so for the most part i use this for when i am traveling or out and about for my business. i find it the right size for the job i am doing and take advantage of apples cloud storage and ways of using other mac's as storage for information so this does not use storage much at all. where this is nice is the quick user functionality it has in access these documents or programs needed seamlessly and being able to help keep my business moving on the road. most of the time i am using browser programs to access the business info or using the cloud to access files back at the home base which is the new mac mini with an external hard drive that houses the business information. i find that the size makes a great traveling companion for onsite work. when connecting to a shared internet connection it is nice knowing that the channel is mostly secure and when using my iphone shares cell connection and new chips they can help create a safe network for my means of work. if you are debating getting one for business i recommend using their cloud storage so you eliminate the focus on storage anxiety and makes it more worth it in the long run of having a user interface focused laptop. also the battery for most of the work i am doing lasts me a week with heavy workload 4 days max. honestly you cannot get too much better for a long lasting apple hardware focused product.,5/5,where this is nice is the quick user functionality it has in access these documents or programs needed seamlessly and being able to help keep my business moving on the road | most of the time i am using browser programs to access the business info or using the cloud to access files back at the home base which is the new mac mini with an external hard drive that houses the business information,0.11,"['help nice able', '']"

133,"i was looking to upgrade from my current dual core intel i7 windows laptop and tablet. the 2020 macbook air m1 screen is sharp, the m1 processor performance is similar to intel i7 quad core for most uses . this laptop is fan-less and gets very warm/hot only when constantly exporting very large 5gb+ files - otherwise it runs cool to cold. i edit photos on this laptop and my editing software opens much faster and the edits occur very quickly. the 8gb ram/256 gb ssd combo in this laptop is fast and responsive. the mac os memory management allows 8gb to be more than enough for my projects. the m1 cpu performance and battery life for the macbook air m1 easily exceed those of my dual core i7 windows laptop and tablet. my photo editing software runs faster and is more responsive than on my windows devices. also, the macbook air m1 performance seems the same whether on battery or ac power unlike my windows devices. this laptop is a fantastic entry-level device but hard core gamers and video creators should upgrade to the pro models for the larger/more vibrant screen, richer audio, cooling fans, additional usb-c ports, sd card slot, dual monitor capability, and more ram/ssd options. i purchased this used base model used at a substantial savings over the list price which made it a fantastic value. i would suggest most users get the 512gb or larger internal ssd so you will not need an external ssd for video/music storage. i currently use external ssd drives to store my large files so the small 256gb ssd size in the base model was not an issue. the only possible drawbacks for the macbook air are there are only 2 usb-c data/charging ports so you may need to purchase a dock if you need multiple connection options, (or use older usb accessories), there is no sd card slot, and software apps are still being updated for the m1 cpu. i run microsoft office 365 on my macbook air. i notice that office 365 takes a second or two longer to load but once loaded office 365 runs as fast as it does on windows. i do not use this laptop for gaming, video editing, or to connect multiple monitors so i cannot comment on those uses. i was not expecting this level of performance from an entry-level device. do not get caught up in the hype that this base model can replace the macbook pro models for heavy work loads or professional use - it does not have the heat distribution (fans) to dissipate the heat to prevent thermal throttling under heavy computing or gaming. for most users, just use and enjoy your 2020 macbook air m1!!",5/5,"the 2020 macbook air m1 screen is sharp, the m1 processor performance is similar to intel i7 quad core for most uses | the 8gb ram/256 gb ssd combo in this laptop is fast and responsive | the m1 cpu performance and battery life for the macbook air m1 easily exceed those of my dual core i7 windows laptop and tablet | also, the macbook air m1 performance seems the same whether on battery or ac power unlike my windows devices | this laptop is a fantastic entry-level device but hard core gamers and video creators should upgrade to the pro models for the larger/more vibrant screen, richer audio, cooling fans, additional usb-c ports, sd card slot, dual monitor capability, and more ram/ssd options | the only possible drawbacks for the macbook air are there are only 2 usb-c data/charging ports so you may need to purchase a dock if you need multiple connection options, (or use older usb accessories), there is no sd card slot, and software apps are still being updated for the m1 cpu | i was not expecting this level of performance from an entry-level device",0.13,"['to sharp similar', 'and fast', '', 'the same', '', '', '']"

238,"m1 pro chip is super powerful - photo/video editing, graphic design - this thing just kills it. compared to previous macbook pro, it is a giant leap ahead. these tasks are a main reason to buy the pro version of the macbook. this particularly model is the lower end of the spec you can get for a pro, but it still kicks butt. you can get the pro max chip and bump up the ram to 64gb if you want - and add tons more storage. the 14 inch macbook pro is the perfect size for a balance of portability and power. it can do pretty much everything the 16 inch version does. the display is stunning. just gorgeous. 120hz capability (pro motion) gets rid of blur when scrolling and makes for clearer action when viewing movies. the brightness and black levels on the display are awesome. real hdr viewing - a big difference. you will hear about ""the notch"" at the top of the screen where the camera is. after 10 minutes i do not even notice it. it means nothing for your experience. its just something critics have chosen to harp about. in most apps the notch is no even visible. camera is now a full 1080p and is a big upgrade over previous macbooks. six speaker sound system with new woofers - sounds incredible. music/movies it feels like surround sound. for video conferencing the microphones are studio quality and you can tell - this is great for video conferencing. the keyboard is a dream to type on. very solid like all macbooks, no spongy feel you get with so many other laptops. the apple magic keyboard is the best - as is the track pad. battery life is amazing. i have gone all day on battery without needing to plug in. at best its spec says 17 hours, which is crazy! especially for this spec...but for real world use with a mix of tasks, it will not be 17 hours but i did a 9 hour session yesterday, and still had a ton of battery left. the power efficiency is ground breaking. they have added back the magsafe power plug - which is great! and added back an sd card slot and and an hdmi port - which many of us hated the previous macs that deleted these ports. i wish it had at least one usb-a old style port - but it does not. you get three usb-c thunderbolt 4 ports that you can use with adapters if needed. they got rid of the touch screen bar at the top of the keyboard from previous pro macbooks and put back the regular mechanical keys for the controls. apparently they listened to a lot of users who did not really like the touch pad. the shape and style of this laptop is great. some say the edge of the laptop looks ""sharp"" where your wrists rest. that is bs. i have been typing most of the day and i do not feel any issue with the edge of the laptop at all. very comfy for typing. some haters may try to find reasons to bash this new macbook pro, but i am telling you - from any perspective, all brand bias aside - this is an amazing laptop - the best apple has ever made, hands down. and i would say you will not find a better power laptop anywhere. all that said - this is not a gamers machine. apple is not for hard core gamers. i mean you can play games on it that you get from the app store. i am a hard core gamer and a pc geek - i have a powerful windows pc for gaming. and always will. but for everything else. this macbook is king. i use to for music, for photo and video editing, for productivity. i can plut into a giant monitor if i want a bigger screen - it works great on my 34 inch ips panel. so if you are wondering if this macbook 14 inch pro is the real deal or not - i am here to tell you, its the real deal. i finally upgraded from my 2015 macbook pro because this new one hits so many sweet spots - revolutionary power and battery life, excellent ergonomic design, great sound, stunning display - its the whole package. if you are thinking of getting one - you will not be disappointed. one last comment. i am an old timer windows guy, and i know all the counter arguments for the mac. many wills say this is overpriced compared to a windows laptop with similar spec. first, show me an intel based laptop that can match these new m1 pro chips - you cannot. and aside from that, the mac os is secure and stable - rock solid - and is intuitive with amazing features - like the ability to copy and paste text from a photo! whaaat? and the design/ergonomics/quality of these macbooks is unmatched. so, yes you pay more - but you get more. my last macbook pro lasted me almost 7 years and it still works great. if you want this laptop - get it! it rocks.",5/5,you can get the pro max chip and bump up the ram to 64gb if you want - and add tons more storage,0.5,['']

613,"i bought this laptop both for college and gaming, but the amount of issues it came with makes it annoying to use. first of all, when i came it would not turn on or charge (yes the charger had clicked but still nothing). i contacted acer and they told me to send it over for check up, i could not because i needed it for college so i asked for a refund but it was not going through so i had to wait a few days to see if i could get one. the laptop ended up charging so i decided to not return it (which i regret). soon after, (like not even a day after) this glitch would randomly appear multiple times and it was annoying. the bottom of the screen would multiply, go in up and down motions, and vibrate through the whole screen and it just would not stop doing it for a few seconds/minute. knowing that they would have just told me to send it over, i sucked it up even though it would get worse every time. secondly, the battery life. it really does suck, it never lasts more than 2 hours even when i am just doing assignments in word. and when gaming it will not even last an hour. thirdly, it is supposed to be for gaming but it lags and it is slow even when i am just using google or doing assignments. it literally takes so long to load, games are laggy, etc. i expected a 16 ram, i7 processor to at least run a roblox game, but no. it lags to even that. fourthly, the charging port broke. it started having issues to charge again, sometimes it would stop charging. not long after, it completely stopped charging so i assumed it was the charger so i bought a new one (which was $50) just to find out the charger was not the issue. now, it charges if the charger is at a specific position, move it a little and it will stop charging.",2/5,"i expected a 16 ram, i7 processor to at least run a roblox game, but no",-0.27,['']

672,"i will put this first. i am unsure if the ram or solid state drive is set or if you can upgrade them. i did not try to open or upgrade the item. these are the two things you should research before purchasing this. although with the current specification, i am sure you do not need to do that. this acer laptop overall is an average size laptop and the specification are not bad for what you get. this laptop is relatively thin and not too heavy. it has a decent processor (ryzen 7). the ram is 16 gb which is well beyond the suggested nowadays. it will definitely work for most daily usage as well as design and gaming. that being said, it is not the best in terms of battery life. it really only last about three to four hours at most on a full charge. the fan is a bit loud on heavy usage. it is a standard ac charger which can make it a bit annoying to replace in the future if needed. the power brick is okay but does get hot while charging. you will need it plugged in to really game on this device. upon boot up of the acer laptop, the laptop boots up fairly quick. the setup is pretty straight forward and does not require any driver installation. the bloatware is not too terrible. the laptop also has only a 14 inch screen with the max resolution at 1920 x 1080. the screen has an okay brightness but not the best quality. it still keep the traditional two usb port as well so you do not have to buy an adapter for this laptop while also having the type c (non thunderbolt) port. the laptop can be angled back for better viewing but it cannot be pushed back all the way. the laptop surface where the wrist rest is where i do not like the material. it looks nice with the bright silver but with long term use it will fade over time. the keys are okay, but not the best. i am not a fan of typing on them as it just feels a bit on the cheaper end. the external casing of this surface is very easy to scratch (seems to be an issue with all this material) so i would recommend that you get a laptop case for it. the trackpad runs pretty well, it is sensitive and feels smooth to move across. it also does not look like it will wear down easily which is good. there is a camera that will record at at least 720p. you could put a web cam cover on it. the dual microphone makes for a very clear voice and i have not had any issues with any sound issues. it usually does not pick up too much surrounding noise and focuses more on voice. on laptop, there is a 3.5 port to plug in headphones/microphone. it does have dual band wifi built in and no issues with speed/connection. the laptop itself can last about five to six hours or so on a full charge. depending on how much you have open and how much you utilize the laptop capability, you could actually have less than that. best thing to do is just balance the resource as best you can. the overall charge time depends but it can take up to three to charge the laptop to 100% from what i can tell. it is not too long and the charger does get hot so handle with care. it has a decent boot up being less than fifteen seconds to boot up but the bloatware has to go so i would recommend you uninstall that if possible. the speaker system is pretty loud but they do have a bit of a feedback noise that is a bit annoying but that is okay. the 3060 ti runs great! it is a very powerful card that allows you to game very well on this computer although the screen is only 14 inches. the fan also is a bit loud on high usage (gaming). the processor is an ryzen 7 which is more than enough power for what i need it to do on a daily. in terms of video games, it can play many games at very high quality although you do need to have it plugged in. the processing speed is really fast and it works really well for what i need. there is an hdmi port so you are able to connect this to an external screen. i am unsure if there is a dock that is meant for this laptop. overall this laptop is a a very powerful laptop. you get a smaller screen but the gaming on it is not bad. the acer laptop can run a bit hot and the battery life is not the best. the specification is not bad at 16 gb ram and 512 gb ssd drive. the space is decent for what i need it for but for gaming it will fill up fast. it is good for all around use and can easily be made into a work, gaming, or basic computer with a single monitor connection.",5/5,i am unsure if the ram or solid state drive is set or if you can upgrade them | it has a decent processor (ryzen 7) | the ram is 16 gb which is well beyond the suggested nowadays | the processor is an ryzen 7 which is more than enough power for what i need it to do on a daily | the specification is not bad at 16 gb ram and 512 gb ssd drive,0.17,"['unsure', '', '', '', 'not bad']"

1050,"i was looking to upgrade from my current dual core intel i7 windows laptop and tablet. the 2020 macbook air m1 screen is sharp, the m1 processor performance is similar to intel i7 quad core for most uses . this laptop is fan-less and gets very warm/hot only when constantly exporting very large 5gb+ files - otherwise it runs cool to cold. i edit photos on this laptop and my editing software opens much faster and the edits occur very quickly. the 8gb ram/256 gb ssd combo in this laptop is fast and responsive. the mac os memory management allows 8gb to be more than enough for my projects. the m1 cpu performance and battery life for the macbook air m1 easily exceed those of my dual core i7 windows laptop and tablet. my photo editing software runs faster and is more responsive than on my windows devices. also, the macbook air m1 performance seems the same whether on battery or ac power unlike my windows devices. this laptop is a fantastic entry-level device but hard core gamers and video creators should upgrade to the pro models for the larger/more vibrant screen, richer audio, cooling fans, additional usb-c ports, sd card slot, dual monitor capability, and more ram/ssd options. i purchased this used base model used at a substantial savings over the list price which made it a fantastic value. i would suggest most users get the 512gb or larger internal ssd so you will not need an external ssd for video/music storage. i currently use external ssd drives to store my large files so the small 256gb ssd size in the base model was not an issue. the only possible drawbacks for the macbook air are there are only 2 usb-c data/charging ports so you may need to purchase a dock if you need multiple connection options, (or use older usb accessories), there is no sd card slot, and software apps are still being updated for the m1 cpu. i run microsoft office 365 on my macbook air. i notice that office 365 takes a second or two longer to load but once loaded office 365 runs as fast as it does on windows. i do not use this laptop for gaming, video editing, or to connect multiple monitors so i cannot comment on those uses. i was not expecting this level of performance from an entry-level device. do not get caught up in the hype that this base model can replace the macbook pro models for heavy work loads or professional use - it does not have the heat distribution (fans) to dissipate the heat to prevent thermal throttling under heavy computing or gaming. for most users, just use and enjoy your 2020 macbook air m1!!",5/5,"the 2020 macbook air m1 screen is sharp, the m1 processor performance is similar to intel i7 quad core for most uses | the 8gb ram/256 gb ssd combo in this laptop is fast and responsive | the m1 cpu performance and battery life for the macbook air m1 easily exceed those of my dual core i7 windows laptop and tablet | also, the macbook air m1 performance seems the same whether on battery or ac power unlike my windows devices | this laptop is a fantastic entry-level device but hard core gamers and video creators should upgrade to the pro models for the larger/more vibrant screen, richer audio, cooling fans, additional usb-c ports, sd card slot, dual monitor capability, and more ram/ssd options | the only possible drawbacks for the macbook air are there are only 2 usb-c data/charging ports so you may need to purchase a dock if you need multiple connection options, (or use older usb accessories), there is no sd card slot, and software apps are still being updated for the m1 cpu | i was not expecting this level of performance from an entry-level device",0.13,"['to sharp similar', 'and fast', '', 'the same', '', '', '']"

1056,"i was a bit concerned about the fact that apple has moved away from intel and is now producing their own m1 processor but i have to say it is incredibly fast. my company provides me with my computer of choice for work and in 2020 i received a top of the line macbook pro with an intel 8 core i9 processor and 64gb of memory and 4tb ssd that retailed for close to $5,000 and i have to say this new macbook pro with the 10 core m1, 16 core gpu, 1tb ssd and only 16gb of memory at almost half that price seems much faster. the display is just stunning. the graphics quality is among the best i have seen and video performance is flawless. it is everything a macbook pro should be. high performance in a sleek aluminum case. a couple of things to note if you are not familiar with this computer and thinking of buying one. it only comes with 3 usb-c / thunderbolt 3 interfaces. so you are going to need adapters if you plan on using any wired peripheral devices like keyboard, mouse, external drives etc.. that have standard usb interfaces. and at a minimum you should be backing your system up to an external drive. so, i would recommend buying a usb-c to usb hub as i am not big on adapters. there is several here on amazon in the $20-30 range. also, like most other manufacturers, apple has dropped the dvd/cd. it is not even an option. if burning dvds and cds is still a thing for you, again you can connect an external device with a hub or adapter. i would also recommend buying a cooling tray, especially if you are going to leave this computer on a desk powered up perpetually or for long periods of time so you can protect the cpu and more importantly the gpu from heat. lastly, a few words on macos montery that shipped with this computer. the most recent os i was using was sierra on my mbp 2013 and the learning curve was not difficult at all. my only complaint is monterey turns on a lot of stuff i do not need or even want. for example, as soon as i signed in with my apple id to sync my music from icloud, i started getting texts, facetime and even phone calls for my entire family on my computer. we use the same apple id for all our devices for a number of reasons and while it was not too difficult to disable, i would rather apple leave that up to the user. i will post an update more geared toward the performance and reliability of this system as time goes by but for now, i have to say i am very pleased and would highly recommend this new macbook pro. one final comment on the purchase process. i actually ordered one directly from apple. i live about 60 miles from an apple store and wanted it shipped to me. i was given a projected ship date about 3 weeks after placing my order. after waiting almost the full 3 weeks, my order was still processing and had not moved toward the preparing to ship status. i then realized apple has a store here on amazon, they had exactly what i wanted in stock. so after canceling my order with apple, i bought my computer here on amazon and it arrived in 2 days.",5/5,"i was a bit concerned about the fact that apple has moved away from intel and is now producing their own m1 processor but i have to say it is incredibly fast | my company provides me with my computer of choice for work and in 2020 i received a top of the line macbook pro with an intel 8 core i9 processor and 64gb of memory and 4tb ssd that retailed for close to $5,000 and i have to say this new macbook pro with the 10 core m1, 16 core gpu, 1tb ssd and only 16gb of memory at almost half that price seems much faster | the graphics quality is among the best i have seen and video performance is flawless | high performance in a sleek aluminum case | i would also recommend buying a cooling tray, especially if you are going to leave this computer on a desk powered up perpetually or for long periods of time so you can protect the cpu and more importantly the gpu from heat | i will post an update more geared toward the performance and reliability of this system as time goes by but for now, i have to say i am very pleased and would highly recommend this new macbook pro",0.31,"['incredibly bit concerned fast', 'with pro', 'flawless', 'high', '', 'very pleased']"

1125,"this does not have touch screen on my model. the fhd display really surprised me. it is better picture than a lot of these tvs. as with all products they hide the defects from you until a month later. as soon as the 33th day rolled on i turned on the laptop and discovered sure enough it is got a burnt pixel. no way to fix that without replacing the screen. unless you have 5+ burned out pixels, good luck getting a return or any repairs. hp is still shady in that regard. i fully upgraded the machine when i got it. 16gb ram, 1tb samsung 980 ssd. the performance actually is comparable to my tower in many respects. i have a geforce 980, an octocore amd cpu, and 24gb ddr3 ram in my tower. this laptop of course has a little less ram, but it plays games about just as well as on my tower. i really am surprised at this. the cooling situation is absolutely garbage with this laptop. the engineers put the cpu exhaust port pointing directly into the hinge portion of the case. this makes it so the computer is actively fighting by blowing air into a 1/5 cm gap. there is just a row of holes in the bottle for air intake. i picked up a tray with a cooling fan pad and that solved the heat problem. i see it having problems in the future just because of how they designed the fan. the excess heat not only kills your hardware lifespan but it slows your machine down by auto throttling. if i could i would have installed heat spreaders all over the inside of this machine, but there just is not room. they could not even be bothered to make the air inlets in the front of the case. it is asking to burn up after so many years deliberately. i had problems with hp in the past, they screwed up a laptop return i sent in, then blamed me for water damage when i had before and after pictures, so i am not shocked at how they treat customers. i swore i would not buy another hp but this one was just too cheap to pass up. it is super light weight. the camera is nothing fancy, in windows 11, you will find you lack all of your audio enhancement options. it is instead been replaced by this crap hp audio tool. ditch it as soon as you can and find something like pulse audio so you can hear out of the cheap cheap cheap dog szzz cheap speakers. you will also want to get a good set of headphones. the performance is a little low unless you do add that second stick of ram as so many other people have pointed out. the machine simply was not designed properly, and they are taking it out of the consumers pocket by keeping them ignorant and not showing important aspects such as showing how the fan is smack dab in the middle of a 1/2cm gap. when you close the lid and open it after 20 minutes you will find it is incredibly warm if you have it hooked up to hdmi. it forces you to keep the screen open, which is not good to have static screens. i honestly think the burned out pixel happened just from the excess heat, but there is not anything i can do about it. it is not that bad, but once you see something you can never unsee it. i have a warranty but again, it is not going to cover this damage, so i spent money and not even 30 days later it has depreciated in value by the price of the lcd screen. the case is the cheapest plastic they could find. given this was produced during the pandemic you are left with another problem. check your ram speeds. if you get stuck with a 1r16 chip you are basically having 1 librarian trying to organize 16 shelves, whereas the good ram 2r8 would be equal to 2 librarians keeping up with 8 shelves. now you can see how the extra work load slows your machine. they do not mention this in their sales page or documentation, and you will only find out after you get it and run software to look at it, or pull the machine apart. overall, i probably would not buy this machine again, even though it works fast for an entry level computer. it is just too poorly designed. i give it a year or two before it fails. most likely, knowing hp it will be 26 minutes after the oem warranty expires. they used this planned obsolescence to rip off customers, and even though it is been nearly 8 years since i swore i would not buy another one, they changed; for the worse.",4/5,"16gb ram, 1tb samsung 980 ssd | the performance actually is comparable to my tower in many respects | i have a geforce 980, an octocore amd cpu, and 24gb ddr3 ram in my tower | this laptop of course has a little less ram, but it plays games about just as well as on my tower | the engineers put the cpu exhaust port pointing directly into the hinge portion of the case | the performance is a little low unless you do add that second stick of ram as so many other people have pointed out | check your ram speeds | if you get stuck with a 1r16 chip you are basically having 1 librarian trying to organize 16 shelves, whereas the good ram 2r8 would be equal to 2 librarians keeping up with 8 shelves",0.09,"['', 'to comparable', '', '', '', 'little low', '', 'to equal']"

1208,"m1 pro chip is super powerful - photo/video editing, graphic design - this thing just kills it. compared to previous macbook pro, it is a giant leap ahead. these tasks are a main reason to buy the pro version of the macbook. this particularly model is the lower end of the spec you can get for a pro, but it still kicks butt. you can get the pro max chip and bump up the ram to 64gb if you want - and add tons more storage. the 14 inch macbook pro is the perfect size for a balance of portability and power. it can do pretty much everything the 16 inch version does. the display is stunning. just gorgeous. 120hz capability (pro motion) gets rid of blur when scrolling and makes for clearer action when viewing movies. the brightness and black levels on the display are awesome. real hdr viewing - a big difference. you will hear about ""the notch"" at the top of the screen where the camera is. after 10 minutes i do not even notice it. it means nothing for your experience. its just something critics have chosen to harp about. in most apps the notch is no even visible. camera is now a full 1080p and is a big upgrade over previous macbooks. six speaker sound system with new woofers - sounds incredible. music/movies it feels like surround sound. for video conferencing the microphones are studio quality and you can tell - this is great for video conferencing. the keyboard is a dream to type on. very solid like all macbooks, no spongy feel you get with so many other laptops. the apple magic keyboard is the best - as is the track pad. battery life is amazing. i have gone all day on battery without needing to plug in. at best its spec says 17 hours, which is crazy! especially for this spec...but for real world use with a mix of tasks, it will not be 17 hours but i did a 9 hour session yesterday, and still had a ton of battery left. the power efficiency is ground breaking. they have added back the magsafe power plug - which is great! and added back an sd card slot and and an hdmi port - which many of us hated the previous macs that deleted these ports. i wish it had at least one usb-a old style port - but it does not. you get three usb-c thunderbolt 4 ports that you can use with adapters if needed. they got rid of the touch screen bar at the top of the keyboard from previous pro macbooks and put back the regular mechanical keys for the controls. apparently they listened to a lot of users who did not really like the touch pad. the shape and style of this laptop is great. some say the edge of the laptop looks ""sharp"" where your wrists rest. that is bs. i have been typing most of the day and i do not feel any issue with the edge of the laptop at all. very comfy for typing. some haters may try to find reasons to bash this new macbook pro, but i am telling you - from any perspective, all brand bias aside - this is an amazing laptop - the best apple has ever made, hands down. and i would say you will not find a better power laptop anywhere. all that said - this is not a gamers machine. apple is not for hard core gamers. i mean you can play games on it that you get from the app store. i am a hard core gamer and a pc geek - i have a powerful windows pc for gaming. and always will. but for everything else. this macbook is king. i use to for music, for photo and video editing, for productivity. i can plut into a giant monitor if i want a bigger screen - it works great on my 34 inch ips panel. so if you are wondering if this macbook 14 inch pro is the real deal or not - i am here to tell you, its the real deal. i finally upgraded from my 2015 macbook pro because this new one hits so many sweet spots - revolutionary power and battery life, excellent ergonomic design, great sound, stunning display - its the whole package. if you are thinking of getting one - you will not be disappointed. one last comment. i am an old timer windows guy, and i know all the counter arguments for the mac. many wills say this is overpriced compared to a windows laptop with similar spec. first, show me an intel based laptop that can match these new m1 pro chips - you cannot. and aside from that, the mac os is secure and stable - rock solid - and is intuitive with amazing features - like the ability to copy and paste text from a photo! whaaat? and the design/ergonomics/quality of these macbooks is unmatched. so, yes you pay more - but you get more. my last macbook pro lasted me almost 7 years and it still works great. if you want this laptop - get it! it rocks.",5/5,you can get the pro max chip and bump up the ram to 64gb if you want - and add tons more storage,0.5,['']

1519,"i will put this first. i am unsure if the ram or solid state drive is set or if you can upgrade them. i did not try to open or upgrade the item. these are the two things you should research before purchasing this. although with the current specification, i am sure you do not need to do that. this acer laptop overall is an average size laptop and the specification are not bad for what you get. this laptop is relatively thin and not too heavy. it has a decent processor (ryzen 7). the ram is 16 gb which is well beyond the suggested nowadays. it will definitely work for most daily usage as well as design and gaming. that being said, it is not the best in terms of battery life. it really only last about three to four hours at most on a full charge. the fan is a bit loud on heavy usage. it is a standard ac charger which can make it a bit annoying to replace in the future if needed. the power brick is okay but does get hot while charging. you will need it plugged in to really game on this device. upon boot up of the acer laptop, the laptop boots up fairly quick. the setup is pretty straight forward and does not require any driver installation. the bloatware is not too terrible. the laptop also has only a 14 inch screen with the max resolution at 1920 x 1080. the screen has an okay brightness but not the best quality. it still keep the traditional two usb port as well so you do not have to buy an adapter for this laptop while also having the type c (non thunderbolt) port. the laptop can be angled back for better viewing but it cannot be pushed back all the way. the laptop surface where the wrist rest is where i do not like the material. it looks nice with the bright silver but with long term use it will fade over time. the keys are okay, but not the best. i am not a fan of typing on them as it just feels a bit on the cheaper end. the external casing of this surface is very easy to scratch (seems to be an issue with all this material) so i would recommend that you get a laptop case for it. the trackpad runs pretty well, it is sensitive and feels smooth to move across. it also does not look like it will wear down easily which is good. there is a camera that will record at at least 720p. you could put a web cam cover on it. the dual microphone makes for a very clear voice and i have not had any issues with any sound issues. it usually does not pick up too much surrounding noise and focuses more on voice. on laptop, there is a 3.5 port to plug in headphones/microphone. it does have dual band wifi built in and no issues with speed/connection. the laptop itself can last about five to six hours or so on a full charge. depending on how much you have open and how much you utilize the laptop capability, you could actually have less than that. best thing to do is just balance the resource as best you can. the overall charge time depends but it can take up to three to charge the laptop to 100% from what i can tell. it is not too long and the charger does get hot so handle with care. it has a decent boot up being less than fifteen seconds to boot up but the bloatware has to go so i would recommend you uninstall that if possible. the speaker system is pretty loud but they do have a bit of a feedback noise that is a bit annoying but that is okay. the 3060 ti runs great! it is a very powerful card that allows you to game very well on this computer although the screen is only 14 inches. the fan also is a bit loud on high usage (gaming). the processor is an ryzen 7 which is more than enough power for what i need it to do on a daily. in terms of video games, it can play many games at very high quality although you do need to have it plugged in. the processing speed is really fast and it works really well for what i need. there is an hdmi port so you are able to connect this to an external screen. i am unsure if there is a dock that is meant for this laptop. overall this laptop is a a very powerful laptop. you get a smaller screen but the gaming on it is not bad. the acer laptop can run a bit hot and the battery life is not the best. the specification is not bad at 16 gb ram and 512 gb ssd drive. the space is decent for what i need it for but for gaming it will fill up fast. it is good for all around use and can easily be made into a work, gaming, or basic computer with a single monitor connection.",5/5,i am unsure if the ram or solid state drive is set or if you can upgrade them | it has a decent processor (ryzen 7) | the ram is 16 gb which is well beyond the suggested nowadays | the processor is an ryzen 7 which is more than enough power for what i need it to do on a daily | the specification is not bad at 16 gb ram and 512 gb ssd drive,0.17,"['unsure', '', '', '', 'not bad']"

1560,"this does not have touch screen on my model. the fhd display really surprised me. it is better picture than a lot of these tvs. as with all products they hide the defects from you until a month later. as soon as the 33th day rolled on i turned on the laptop and discovered sure enough it is got a burnt pixel. no way to fix that without replacing the screen. unless you have 5+ burned out pixels, good luck getting a return or any repairs. hp is still shady in that regard. i fully upgraded the machine when i got it. 16gb ram, 1tb samsung 980 ssd. the performance actually is comparable to my tower in many respects. i have a geforce 980, an octocore amd cpu, and 24gb ddr3 ram in my tower. this laptop of course has a little less ram, but it plays games about just as well as on my tower. i really am surprised at this. the cooling situation is absolutely garbage with this laptop. the engineers put the cpu exhaust port pointing directly into the hinge portion of the case. this makes it so the computer is actively fighting by blowing air into a 1/5 cm gap. there is just a row of holes in the bottle for air intake. i picked up a tray with a cooling fan pad and that solved the heat problem. i see it having problems in the future just because of how they designed the fan. the excess heat not only kills your hardware lifespan but it slows your machine down by auto throttling. if i could i would have installed heat spreaders all over the inside of this machine, but there just is not room. they could not even be bothered to make the air inlets in the front of the case. it is asking to burn up after so many years deliberately. i had problems with hp in the past, they screwed up a laptop return i sent in, then blamed me for water damage when i had before and after pictures, so i am not shocked at how they treat customers. i swore i would not buy another hp but this one was just too cheap to pass up. it is super light weight. the camera is nothing fancy, in windows 11, you will find you lack all of your audio enhancement options. it is instead been replaced by this crap hp audio tool. ditch it as soon as you can and find something like pulse audio so you can hear out of the cheap cheap cheap dog szzz cheap speakers. you will also want to get a good set of headphones. the performance is a little low unless you do add that second stick of ram as so many other people have pointed out. the machine simply was not designed properly, and they are taking it out of the consumers pocket by keeping them ignorant and not showing important aspects such as showing how the fan is smack dab in the middle of a 1/2cm gap. when you close the lid and open it after 20 minutes you will find it is incredibly warm if you have it hooked up to hdmi. it forces you to keep the screen open, which is not good to have static screens. i honestly think the burned out pixel happened just from the excess heat, but there is not anything i can do about it. it is not that bad, but once you see something you can never unsee it. i have a warranty but again, it is not going to cover this damage, so i spent money and not even 30 days later it has depreciated in value by the price of the lcd screen. the case is the cheapest plastic they could find. given this was produced during the pandemic you are left with another problem. check your ram speeds. if you get stuck with a 1r16 chip you are basically having 1 librarian trying to organize 16 shelves, whereas the good ram 2r8 would be equal to 2 librarians keeping up with 8 shelves. now you can see how the extra work load slows your machine. they do not mention this in their sales page or documentation, and you will only find out after you get it and run software to look at it, or pull the machine apart. overall, i probably would not buy this machine again, even though it works fast for an entry level computer. it is just too poorly designed. i give it a year or two before it fails. most likely, knowing hp it will be 26 minutes after the oem warranty expires. they used this planned obsolescence to rip off customers, and even though it is been nearly 8 years since i swore i would not buy another one, they changed; for the worse.",4/5,"16gb ram, 1tb samsung 980 ssd | the performance actually is comparable to my tower in many respects | i have a geforce 980, an octocore amd cpu, and 24gb ddr3 ram in my tower | this laptop of course has a little less ram, but it plays games about just as well as on my tower | the engineers put the cpu exhaust port pointing directly into the hinge portion of the case | the performance is a little low unless you do add that second stick of ram as so many other people have pointed out | check your ram speeds | if you get stuck with a 1r16 chip you are basically having 1 librarian trying to organize 16 shelves, whereas the good ram 2r8 would be equal to 2 librarians keeping up with 8 shelves",0.09,"['', 'to comparable', '', '', '', 'little low', '', 'to equal']"

1743,"i will put this first. i am unsure if the ram or solid state drive is set or if you can upgrade them. i did not try to open or upgrade the item. these are the two things you should research before purchasing this. although with the current specification, i am sure you do not need to do that. this acer laptop overall is an average size laptop and the specification are not bad for what you get. this laptop is relatively thin and not too heavy. it has a decent processor (ryzen 7). the ram is 16 gb which is well beyond the suggested nowadays. it will definitely work for most daily usage as well as design and gaming. that being said, it is not the best in terms of battery life. it really only last about three to four hours at most on a full charge. the fan is a bit loud on heavy usage. it is a standard ac charger which can make it a bit annoying to replace in the future if needed. the power brick is okay but does get hot while charging. you will need it plugged in to really game on this device. upon boot up of the acer laptop, the laptop boots up fairly quick. the setup is pretty straight forward and does not require any driver installation. the bloatware is not too terrible. the laptop also has only a 14 inch screen with the max resolution at 1920 x 1080. the screen has an okay brightness but not the best quality. it still keep the traditional two usb port as well so you do not have to buy an adapter for this laptop while also having the type c (non thunderbolt) port. the laptop can be angled back for better viewing but it cannot be pushed back all the way. the laptop surface where the wrist rest is where i do not like the material. it looks nice with the bright silver but with long term use it will fade over time. the keys are okay, but not the best. i am not a fan of typing on them as it just feels a bit on the cheaper end. the external casing of this surface is very easy to scratch (seems to be an issue with all this material) so i would recommend that you get a laptop case for it. the trackpad runs pretty well, it is sensitive and feels smooth to move across. it also does not look like it will wear down easily which is good. there is a camera that will record at at least 720p. you could put a web cam cover on it. the dual microphone makes for a very clear voice and i have not had any issues with any sound issues. it usually does not pick up too much surrounding noise and focuses more on voice. on laptop, there is a 3.5 port to plug in headphones/microphone. it does have dual band wifi built in and no issues with speed/connection. the laptop itself can last about five to six hours or so on a full charge. depending on how much you have open and how much you utilize the laptop capability, you could actually have less than that. best thing to do is just balance the resource as best you can. the overall charge time depends but it can take up to three to charge the laptop to 100% from what i can tell. it is not too long and the charger does get hot so handle with care. it has a decent boot up being less than fifteen seconds to boot up but the bloatware has to go so i would recommend you uninstall that if possible. the speaker system is pretty loud but they do have a bit of a feedback noise that is a bit annoying but that is okay. the 3060 ti runs great! it is a very powerful card that allows you to game very well on this computer although the screen is only 14 inches. the fan also is a bit loud on high usage (gaming). the processor is an ryzen 7 which is more than enough power for what i need it to do on a daily. in terms of video games, it can play many games at very high quality although you do need to have it plugged in. the processing speed is really fast and it works really well for what i need. there is an hdmi port so you are able to connect this to an external screen. i am unsure if there is a dock that is meant for this laptop. overall this laptop is a a very powerful laptop. you get a smaller screen but the gaming on it is not bad. the acer laptop can run a bit hot and the battery life is not the best. the specification is not bad at 16 gb ram and 512 gb ssd drive. the space is decent for what i need it for but for gaming it will fill up fast. it is good for all around use and can easily be made into a work, gaming, or basic computer with a single monitor connection.",5/5,i am unsure if the ram or solid state drive is set or if you can upgrade them | it has a decent processor (ryzen 7) | the ram is 16 gb which is well beyond the suggested nowadays | the processor is an ryzen 7 which is more than enough power for what i need it to do on a daily | the specification is not bad at 16 gb ram and 512 gb ssd drive,0.17,"['unsure', '', '', '', 'not bad']"

2574,"i was a bit concerned about the fact that apple has moved away from intel and is now producing their own m1 processor but i have to say it is incredibly fast. my company provides me with my computer of choice for work and in 2020 i received a top of the line macbook pro with an intel 8 core i9 processor and 64gb of memory and 4tb ssd that retailed for close to $5,000 and i have to say this new macbook pro with the 10 core m1, 16 core gpu, 1tb ssd and only 16gb of memory at almost half that price seems much faster. the display is just stunning. the graphics quality is among the best i have seen and video performance is flawless. it is everything a macbook pro should be. high performance in a sleek aluminum case. a couple of things to note if you are not familiar with this computer and thinking of buying one. it only comes with 3 usb-c / thunderbolt 3 interfaces. so you are going to need adapters if you plan on using any wired peripheral devices like keyboard, mouse, external drives etc.. that have standard usb interfaces. and at a minimum you should be backing your system up to an external drive. so, i would recommend buying a usb-c to usb hub as i am not big on adapters. there is several here on amazon in the $20-30 range. also, like most other manufacturers, apple has dropped the dvd/cd. it is not even an option. if burning dvds and cds is still a thing for you, again you can connect an external device with a hub or adapter. i would also recommend buying a cooling tray, especially if you are going to leave this computer on a desk powered up perpetually or for long periods of time so you can protect the cpu and more importantly the gpu from heat. lastly, a few words on macos montery that shipped with this computer. the most recent os i was using was sierra on my mbp 2013 and the learning curve was not difficult at all. my only complaint is monterey turns on a lot of stuff i do not need or even want. for example, as soon as i signed in with my apple id to sync my music from icloud, i started getting texts, facetime and even phone calls for my entire family on my computer. we use the same apple id for all our devices for a number of reasons and while it was not too difficult to disable, i would rather apple leave that up to the user. i will post an update more geared toward the performance and reliability of this system as time goes by but for now, i have to say i am very pleased and would highly recommend this new macbook pro. one final comment on the purchase process. i actually ordered one directly from apple. i live about 60 miles from an apple store and wanted it shipped to me. i was given a projected ship date about 3 weeks after placing my order. after waiting almost the full 3 weeks, my order was still processing and had not moved toward the preparing to ship status. i then realized apple has a store here on amazon, they had exactly what i wanted in stock. so after canceling my order with apple, i bought my computer here on amazon and it arrived in 2 days.",5/5,"i was a bit concerned about the fact that apple has moved away from intel and is now producing their own m1 processor but i have to say it is incredibly fast | my company provides me with my computer of choice for work and in 2020 i received a top of the line macbook pro with an intel 8 core i9 processor and 64gb of memory and 4tb ssd that retailed for close to $5,000 and i have to say this new macbook pro with the 10 core m1, 16 core gpu, 1tb ssd and only 16gb of memory at almost half that price seems much faster | the graphics quality is among the best i have seen and video performance is flawless | high performance in a sleek aluminum case | i would also recommend buying a cooling tray, especially if you are going to leave this computer on a desk powered up perpetually or for long periods of time so you can protect the cpu and more importantly the gpu from heat | i will post an update more geared toward the performance and reliability of this system as time goes by but for now, i have to say i am very pleased and would highly recommend this new macbook pro",0.31,"['incredibly bit concerned fast', 'with pro', 'flawless', 'high', '', 'very pleased']"

(by the way, it is interesting that we enjoyed the last computer until one day microsoft ""updated"" my windows 10 and then the computer stopped working. i contacted microsoft and told them how the computer worked fine until they ""updated"" my computer, and asked if they would fix it. they said they would be glad to fix it for a $99 charge. at that point i was loud and angry. i explained that i felt that this was ransom ware. ""you screwed up my computer and for $99 you will fix it"". i said i would not pay such ransom ware money. i would throw my computer away first and buy a new one. i contacted acer tech support and they said they would fix it for nothing. they did, and when asked how i could keep this from happening again they said just unclick the ""automatic update button"". i did just that and for 4 years i loved my computer again.) an update to my review: the laptop arrived with a crack on the face just to the left of the top left speaker. i returned the computer to the supplier and they gave me credit for it minus $77.70 for a restocking charge. no doubt they are restocking the computer so they can sell it to you and pull the same scam on you.-----------a further update on my refund----------the seller (tech deals store) is refusing to refund all my money since i opened the box and started using it before i discovered the crack. i have asked for a full refund, and am awaiting their answer. if i do not receive my money then i will contact amazon and ask them for the remainder off my refund. if that does not work then i will file a dispute with my credit card company. ( i am not letting tech deals store get by with this scam.) further update---- amazon gave me the $77.70 back. i hope i remember the name ""tech deals store"" and never buy from these people again.",1/5,it has an i5 intel processor which appears to be ten times faster than the i3,0.0,['times faster']

3994,"m1 pro chip is super powerful - photo/video editing, graphic design - this thing just kills it. compared to previous macbook pro, it is a giant leap ahead. these tasks are a main reason to buy the pro version of the macbook. this particularly model is the lower end of the spec you can get for a pro, but it still kicks butt. you can get the pro max chip and bump up the ram to 64gb if you want - and add tons more storage. the 14 inch macbook pro is the perfect size for a balance of portability and power. it can do pretty much everything the 16 inch version does. the display is stunning. just gorgeous. 120hz capability (pro motion) gets rid of blur when scrolling and makes for clearer action when viewing movies. the brightness and black levels on the display are awesome. real hdr viewing - a big difference. you will hear about ""the notch"" at the top of the screen where the camera is. after 10 minutes i do not even notice it. it means nothing for your experience. its just something critics have chosen to harp about. in most apps the notch is no even visible. camera is now a full 1080p and is a big upgrade over previous macbooks. six speaker sound system with new woofers - sounds incredible. music/movies it feels like surround sound. for video conferencing the microphones are studio quality and you can tell - this is great for video conferencing. the keyboard is a dream to type on. very solid like all macbooks, no spongy feel you get with so many other laptops. the apple magic keyboard is the best - as is the track pad. battery life is amazing. i have gone all day on battery without needing to plug in. at best its spec says 17 hours, which is crazy! especially for this spec...but for real world use with a mix of tasks, it will not be 17 hours but i did a 9 hour session yesterday, and still had a ton of battery left. the power efficiency is ground breaking. they have added back the magsafe power plug - which is great! and added back an sd card slot and and an hdmi port - which many of us hated the previous macs that deleted these ports. i wish it had at least one usb-a old style port - but it does not. you get three usb-c thunderbolt 4 ports that you can use with adapters if needed. they got rid of the touch screen bar at the top of the keyboard from previous pro macbooks and put back the regular mechanical keys for the controls. apparently they listened to a lot of users who did not really like the touch pad. the shape and style of this laptop is great. some say the edge of the laptop looks ""sharp"" where your wrists rest. that is bs. i have been typing most of the day and i do not feel any issue with the edge of the laptop at all. very comfy for typing. some haters may try to find reasons to bash this new macbook pro, but i am telling you - from any perspective, all brand bias aside - this is an amazing laptop - the best apple has ever made, hands down. and i would say you will not find a better power laptop anywhere. all that said - this is not a gamers machine. apple is not for hard core gamers. i mean you can play games on it that you get from the app store. i am a hard core gamer and a pc geek - i have a powerful windows pc for gaming. and always will. but for everything else. this macbook is king. i use to for music, for photo and video editing, for productivity. i can plut into a giant monitor if i want a bigger screen - it works great on my 34 inch ips panel. so if you are wondering if this macbook 14 inch pro is the real deal or not - i am here to tell you, its the real deal. i finally upgraded from my 2015 macbook pro because this new one hits so many sweet spots - revolutionary power and battery life, excellent ergonomic design, great sound, stunning display - its the whole package. if you are thinking of getting one - you will not be disappointed. one last comment. i am an old timer windows guy, and i know all the counter arguments for the mac. many wills say this is overpriced compared to a windows laptop with similar spec. first, show me an intel based laptop that can match these new m1 pro chips - you cannot. and aside from that, the mac os is secure and stable - rock solid - and is intuitive with amazing features - like the ability to copy and paste text from a photo! whaaat? and the design/ergonomics/quality of these macbooks is unmatched. so, yes you pay more - but you get more. my last macbook pro lasted me almost 7 years and it still works great. if you want this laptop - get it! it rocks.",5/5,you can get the pro max chip and bump up the ram to 64gb if you want - and add tons more storage,0.5,['']

4195,"i will put this first. i am unsure if the ram or solid state drive is set or if you can upgrade them. i did not try to open or upgrade the item. these are the two things you should research before purchasing this. although with the current specification, i am sure you do not need to do that. this acer laptop overall is an average size laptop and the specification are not bad for what you get. this laptop is relatively thin and not too heavy. it has a decent processor (ryzen 7). the ram is 16 gb which is well beyond the suggested nowadays. it will definitely work for most daily usage as well as design and gaming. that being said, it is not the best in terms of battery life. it really only last about three to four hours at most on a full charge. the fan is a bit loud on heavy usage. it is a standard ac charger which can make it a bit annoying to replace in the future if needed. the power brick is okay but does get hot while charging. you will need it plugged in to really game on this device. upon boot up of the acer laptop, the laptop boots up fairly quick. the setup is pretty straight forward and does not require any driver installation. the bloatware is not too terrible. the laptop also has only a 14 inch screen with the max resolution at 1920 x 1080. the screen has an okay brightness but not the best quality. it still keep the traditional two usb port as well so you do not have to buy an adapter for this laptop while also having the type c (non thunderbolt) port. the laptop can be angled back for better viewing but it cannot be pushed back all the way. the laptop surface where the wrist rest is where i do not like the material. it looks nice with the bright silver but with long term use it will fade over time. the keys are okay, but not the best. i am not a fan of typing on them as it just feels a bit on the cheaper end. the external casing of this surface is very easy to scratch (seems to be an issue with all this material) so i would recommend that you get a laptop case for it. the trackpad runs pretty well, it is sensitive and feels smooth to move across. it also does not look like it will wear down easily which is good. there is a camera that will record at at least 720p. you could put a web cam cover on it. the dual microphone makes for a very clear voice and i have not had any issues with any sound issues. it usually does not pick up too much surrounding noise and focuses more on voice. on laptop, there is a 3.5 port to plug in headphones/microphone. it does have dual band wifi built in and no issues with speed/connection. the laptop itself can last about five to six hours or so on a full charge. depending on how much you have open and how much you utilize the laptop capability, you could actually have less than that. best thing to do is just balance the resource as best you can. the overall charge time depends but it can take up to three to charge the laptop to 100% from what i can tell. it is not too long and the charger does get hot so handle with care. it has a decent boot up being less than fifteen seconds to boot up but the bloatware has to go so i would recommend you uninstall that if possible. the speaker system is pretty loud but they do have a bit of a feedback noise that is a bit annoying but that is okay. the 3060 ti runs great! it is a very powerful card that allows you to game very well on this computer although the screen is only 14 inches. the fan also is a bit loud on high usage (gaming). the processor is an ryzen 7 which is more than enough power for what i need it to do on a daily. in terms of video games, it can play many games at very high quality although you do need to have it plugged in. the processing speed is really fast and it works really well for what i need. there is an hdmi port so you are able to connect this to an external screen. i am unsure if there is a dock that is meant for this laptop. overall this laptop is a a very powerful laptop. you get a smaller screen but the gaming on it is not bad. the acer laptop can run a bit hot and the battery life is not the best. the specification is not bad at 16 gb ram and 512 gb ssd drive. the space is decent for what i need it for but for gaming it will fill up fast. it is good for all around use and can easily be made into a work, gaming, or basic computer with a single monitor connection.",5/5,i am unsure if the ram or solid state drive is set or if you can upgrade them | it has a decent processor (ryzen 7) | the ram is 16 gb which is well beyond the suggested nowadays | the processor is an ryzen 7 which is more than enough power for what i need it to do on a daily | the specification is not bad at 16 gb ram and 512 gb ssd drive,0.17,"['unsure', '', '', '', 'not bad']"

4997,"i will put this first. i am unsure if the ram or solid state drive is set or if you can upgrade them. i did not try to open or upgrade the item. these are the two things you should research before purchasing this. although with the current specification, i am sure you do not need to do that. this acer laptop overall is an average size laptop and the specification are not bad for what you get. this laptop is relatively thin and not too heavy. it has a decent processor (ryzen 7). the ram is 16 gb which is well beyond the suggested nowadays. it will definitely work for most daily usage as well as design and gaming. that being said, it is not the best in terms of battery life. it really only last about three to four hours at most on a full charge. the fan is a bit loud on heavy usage. it is a standard ac charger which can make it a bit annoying to replace in the future if needed. the power brick is okay but does get hot while charging. you will need it plugged in to really game on this device. upon boot up of the acer laptop, the laptop boots up fairly quick. the setup is pretty straight forward and does not require any driver installation. the bloatware is not too terrible. the laptop also has only a 14 inch screen with the max resolution at 1920 x 1080. the screen has an okay brightness but not the best quality. it still keep the traditional two usb port as well so you do not have to buy an adapter for this laptop while also having the type c (non thunderbolt) port. the laptop can be angled back for better viewing but it cannot be pushed back all the way. the laptop surface where the wrist rest is where i do not like the material. it looks nice with the bright silver but with long term use it will fade over time. the keys are okay, but not the best. i am not a fan of typing on them as it just feels a bit on the cheaper end. the external casing of this surface is very easy to scratch (seems to be an issue with all this material) so i would recommend that you get a laptop case for it. the trackpad runs pretty well, it is sensitive and feels smooth to move across. it also does not look like it will wear down easily which is good. there is a camera that will record at at least 720p. you could put a web cam cover on it. the dual microphone makes for a very clear voice and i have not had any issues with any sound issues. it usually does not pick up too much surrounding noise and focuses more on voice. on laptop, there is a 3.5 port to plug in headphones/microphone. it does have dual band wifi built in and no issues with speed/connection. the laptop itself can last about five to six hours or so on a full charge. depending on how much you have open and how much you utilize the laptop capability, you could actually have less than that. best thing to do is just balance the resource as best you can. the overall charge time depends but it can take up to three to charge the laptop to 100% from what i can tell. it is not too long and the charger does get hot so handle with care. it has a decent boot up being less than fifteen seconds to boot up but the bloatware has to go so i would recommend you uninstall that if possible. the speaker system is pretty loud but they do have a bit of a feedback noise that is a bit annoying but that is okay. the 3060 ti runs great! it is a very powerful card that allows you to game very well on this computer although the screen is only 14 inches. the fan also is a bit loud on high usage (gaming). the processor is an ryzen 7 which is more than enough power for what i need it to do on a daily. in terms of video games, it can play many games at very high quality although you do need to have it plugged in. the processing speed is really fast and it works really well for what i need. there is an hdmi port so you are able to connect this to an external screen. i am unsure if there is a dock that is meant for this laptop. overall this laptop is a a very powerful laptop. you get a smaller screen but the gaming on it is not bad. the acer laptop can run a bit hot and the battery life is not the best. the specification is not bad at 16 gb ram and 512 gb ssd drive. the space is decent for what i need it for but for gaming it will fill up fast. it is good for all around use and can easily be made into a work, gaming, or basic computer with a single monitor connection.",5/5,i am unsure if the ram or solid state drive is set or if you can upgrade them | it has a decent processor (ryzen 7) | the ram is 16 gb which is well beyond the suggested nowadays | the processor is an ryzen 7 which is more than enough power for what i need it to do on a daily | the specification is not bad at 16 gb ram and 512 gb ssd drive,0.17,"['unsure', '', '', '', 'not bad']"

5123,"i was a bit concerned about the fact that apple has moved away from intel and is now producing their own m1 processor but i have to say it is incredibly fast. my company provides me with my computer of choice for work and in 2020 i received a top of the line macbook pro with an intel 8 core i9 processor and 64gb of memory and 4tb ssd that retailed for close to $5,000 and i have to say this new macbook pro with the 10 core m1, 16 core gpu, 1tb ssd and only 16gb of memory at almost half that price seems much faster. the display is just stunning. the graphics quality is among the best i have seen and video performance is flawless. it is everything a macbook pro should be. high performance in a sleek aluminum case. a couple of things to note if you are not familiar with this computer and thinking of buying one. it only comes with 3 usb-c / thunderbolt 3 interfaces. so you are going to need adapters if you plan on using any wired peripheral devices like keyboard, mouse, external drives etc.. that have standard usb interfaces. and at a minimum you should be backing your system up to an external drive. so, i would recommend buying a usb-c to usb hub as i am not big on adapters. there is several here on amazon in the $20-30 range. also, like most other manufacturers, apple has dropped the dvd/cd. it is not even an option. if burning dvds and cds is still a thing for you, again you can connect an external device with a hub or adapter. i would also recommend buying a cooling tray, especially if you are going to leave this computer on a desk powered up perpetually or for long periods of time so you can protect the cpu and more importantly the gpu from heat. lastly, a few words on macos montery that shipped with this computer. the most recent os i was using was sierra on my mbp 2013 and the learning curve was not difficult at all. my only complaint is monterey turns on a lot of stuff i do not need or even want. for example, as soon as i signed in with my apple id to sync my music from icloud, i started getting texts, facetime and even phone calls for my entire family on my computer. we use the same apple id for all our devices for a number of reasons and while it was not too difficult to disable, i would rather apple leave that up to the user. i will post an update more geared toward the performance and reliability of this system as time goes by but for now, i have to say i am very pleased and would highly recommend this new macbook pro. one final comment on the purchase process. i actually ordered one directly from apple. i live about 60 miles from an apple store and wanted it shipped to me. i was given a projected ship date about 3 weeks after placing my order. after waiting almost the full 3 weeks, my order was still processing and had not moved toward the preparing to ship status. i then realized apple has a store here on amazon, they had exactly what i wanted in stock. so after canceling my order with apple, i bought my computer here on amazon and it arrived in 2 days.",5/5,"i was a bit concerned about the fact that apple has moved away from intel and is now producing their own m1 processor but i have to say it is incredibly fast | my company provides me with my computer of choice for work and in 2020 i received a top of the line macbook pro with an intel 8 core i9 processor and 64gb of memory and 4tb ssd that retailed for close to $5,000 and i have to say this new macbook pro with the 10 core m1, 16 core gpu, 1tb ssd and only 16gb of memory at almost half that price seems much faster | the graphics quality is among the best i have seen and video performance is flawless | high performance in a sleek aluminum case | i would also recommend buying a cooling tray, especially if you are going to leave this computer on a desk powered up perpetually or for long periods of time so you can protect the cpu and more importantly the gpu from heat | i will post an update more geared toward the performance and reliability of this system as time goes by but for now, i have to say i am very pleased and would highly recommend this new macbook pro",0.31,"['incredibly bit concerned fast', 'with pro', 'flawless', 'high', '', 'very pleased']"

5224,"i will put this first. i am unsure if the ram or solid state drive is set or if you can upgrade them. i did not try to open or upgrade the item. these are the two things you should research before purchasing this. although with the current specification, i am sure you do not need to do that. this acer laptop overall is an average size laptop and the specification are not bad for what you get. this laptop is relatively thin and not too heavy. it has a decent processor (ryzen 7). the ram is 16 gb which is well beyond the suggested nowadays. it will definitely work for most daily usage as well as design and gaming. that being said, it is not the best in terms of battery life. it really only last about three to four hours at most on a full charge. the fan is a bit loud on heavy usage. it is a standard ac charger which can make it a bit annoying to replace in the future if needed. the power brick is okay but does get hot while charging. you will need it plugged in to really game on this device. upon boot up of the acer laptop, the laptop boots up fairly quick. the setup is pretty straight forward and does not require any driver installation. the bloatware is not too terrible. the laptop also has only a 14 inch screen with the max resolution at 1920 x 1080. the screen has an okay brightness but not the best quality. it still keep the traditional two usb port as well so you do not have to buy an adapter for this laptop while also having the type c (non thunderbolt) port. the laptop can be angled back for better viewing but it cannot be pushed back all the way. the laptop surface where the wrist rest is where i do not like the material. it looks nice with the bright silver but with long term use it will fade over time. the keys are okay, but not the best. i am not a fan of typing on them as it just feels a bit on the cheaper end. the external casing of this surface is very easy to scratch (seems to be an issue with all this material) so i would recommend that you get a laptop case for it. the trackpad runs pretty well, it is sensitive and feels smooth to move across. it also does not look like it will wear down easily which is good. there is a camera that will record at at least 720p. you could put a web cam cover on it. the dual microphone makes for a very clear voice and i have not had any issues with any sound issues. it usually does not pick up too much surrounding noise and focuses more on voice. on laptop, there is a 3.5 port to plug in headphones/microphone. it does have dual band wifi built in and no issues with speed/connection. the laptop itself can last about five to six hours or so on a full charge. depending on how much you have open and how much you utilize the laptop capability, you could actually have less than that. best thing to do is just balance the resource as best you can. the overall charge time depends but it can take up to three to charge the laptop to 100% from what i can tell. it is not too long and the charger does get hot so handle with care. it has a decent boot up being less than fifteen seconds to boot up but the bloatware has to go so i would recommend you uninstall that if possible. the speaker system is pretty loud but they do have a bit of a feedback noise that is a bit annoying but that is okay. the 3060 ti runs great! it is a very powerful card that allows you to game very well on this computer although the screen is only 14 inches. the fan also is a bit loud on high usage (gaming). the processor is an ryzen 7 which is more than enough power for what i need it to do on a daily. in terms of video games, it can play many games at very high quality although you do need to have it plugged in. the processing speed is really fast and it works really well for what i need. there is an hdmi port so you are able to connect this to an external screen. i am unsure if there is a dock that is meant for this laptop. overall this laptop is a a very powerful laptop. you get a smaller screen but the gaming on it is not bad. the acer laptop can run a bit hot and the battery life is not the best. the specification is not bad at 16 gb ram and 512 gb ssd drive. the space is decent for what i need it for but for gaming it will fill up fast. it is good for all around use and can easily be made into a work, gaming, or basic computer with a single monitor connection.",5/5,i am unsure if the ram or solid state drive is set or if you can upgrade them | it has a decent processor (ryzen 7) | the ram is 16 gb which is well beyond the suggested nowadays | the processor is an ryzen 7 which is more than enough power for what i need it to do on a daily | the specification is not bad at 16 gb ram and 512 gb ssd drive,0.17,"['unsure', '', '', '', 'not bad']"

5244,"this does not have touch screen on my model. the fhd display really surprised me. it is better picture than a lot of these tvs. as with all products they hide the defects from you until a month later. as soon as the 33th day rolled on i turned on the laptop and discovered sure enough it is got a burnt pixel. no way to fix that without replacing the screen. unless you have 5+ burned out pixels, good luck getting a return or any repairs. hp is still shady in that regard. i fully upgraded the machine when i got it. 16gb ram, 1tb samsung 980 ssd. the performance actually is comparable to my tower in many respects. i have a geforce 980, an octocore amd cpu, and 24gb ddr3 ram in my tower. this laptop of course has a little less ram, but it plays games about just as well as on my tower. i really am surprised at this. the cooling situation is absolutely garbage with this laptop. the engineers put the cpu exhaust port pointing directly into the hinge portion of the case. this makes it so the computer is actively fighting by blowing air into a 1/5 cm gap. there is just a row of holes in the bottle for air intake. i picked up a tray with a cooling fan pad and that solved the heat problem. i see it having problems in the future just because of how they designed the fan. the excess heat not only kills your hardware lifespan but it slows your machine down by auto throttling. if i could i would have installed heat spreaders all over the inside of this machine, but there just is not room. they could not even be bothered to make the air inlets in the front of the case. it is asking to burn up after so many years deliberately. i had problems with hp in the past, they screwed up a laptop return i sent in, then blamed me for water damage when i had before and after pictures, so i am not shocked at how they treat customers. i swore i would not buy another hp but this one was just too cheap to pass up. it is super light weight. the camera is nothing fancy, in windows 11, you will find you lack all of your audio enhancement options. it is instead been replaced by this crap hp audio tool. ditch it as soon as you can and find something like pulse audio so you can hear out of the cheap cheap cheap dog szzz cheap speakers. you will also want to get a good set of headphones. the performance is a little low unless you do add that second stick of ram as so many other people have pointed out. the machine simply was not designed properly, and they are taking it out of the consumers pocket by keeping them ignorant and not showing important aspects such as showing how the fan is smack dab in the middle of a 1/2cm gap. when you close the lid and open it after 20 minutes you will find it is incredibly warm if you have it hooked up to hdmi. it forces you to keep the screen open, which is not good to have static screens. i honestly think the burned out pixel happened just from the excess heat, but there is not anything i can do about it. it is not that bad, but once you see something you can never unsee it. i have a warranty but again, it is not going to cover this damage, so i spent money and not even 30 days later it has depreciated in value by the price of the lcd screen. the case is the cheapest plastic they could find. given this was produced during the pandemic you are left with another problem. check your ram speeds. if you get stuck with a 1r16 chip you are basically having 1 librarian trying to organize 16 shelves, whereas the good ram 2r8 would be equal to 2 librarians keeping up with 8 shelves. now you can see how the extra work load slows your machine. they do not mention this in their sales page or documentation, and you will only find out after you get it and run software to look at it, or pull the machine apart. overall, i probably would not buy this machine again, even though it works fast for an entry level computer. it is just too poorly designed. i give it a year or two before it fails. most likely, knowing hp it will be 26 minutes after the oem warranty expires. they used this planned obsolescence to rip off customers, and even though it is been nearly 8 years since i swore i would not buy another one, they changed; for the worse.",4/5,"16gb ram, 1tb samsung 980 ssd | the performance actually is comparable to my tower in many respects | i have a geforce 980, an octocore amd cpu, and 24gb ddr3 ram in my tower | this laptop of course has a little less ram, but it plays games about just as well as on my tower | the engineers put the cpu exhaust port pointing directly into the hinge portion of the case | the performance is a little low unless you do add that second stick of ram as so many other people have pointed out | check your ram speeds | if you get stuck with a 1r16 chip you are basically having 1 librarian trying to organize 16 shelves, whereas the good ram 2r8 would be equal to 2 librarians keeping up with 8 shelves",0.09,"['', 'to comparable', '', '', '', 'little low', '', 'to equal']"

5342,"m1 pro chip is super powerful - photo/video editing, graphic design - this thing just kills it. compared to previous macbook pro, it is a giant leap ahead. these tasks are a main reason to buy the pro version of the macbook. this particularly model is the lower end of the spec you can get for a pro, but it still kicks butt. you can get the pro max chip and bump up the ram to 64gb if you want - and add tons more storage. the 14 inch macbook pro is the perfect size for a balance of portability and power. it can do pretty much everything the 16 inch version does. the display is stunning. just gorgeous. 120hz capability (pro motion) gets rid of blur when scrolling and makes for clearer action when viewing movies. the brightness and black levels on the display are awesome. real hdr viewing - a big difference. you will hear about ""the notch"" at the top of the screen where the camera is. after 10 minutes i do not even notice it. it means nothing for your experience. its just something critics have chosen to harp about. in most apps the notch is no even visible. camera is now a full 1080p and is a big upgrade over previous macbooks. six speaker sound system with new woofers - sounds incredible. music/movies it feels like surround sound. for video conferencing the microphones are studio quality and you can tell - this is great for video conferencing. the keyboard is a dream to type on. very solid like all macbooks, no spongy feel you get with so many other laptops. the apple magic keyboard is the best - as is the track pad. battery life is amazing. i have gone all day on battery without needing to plug in. at best its spec says 17 hours, which is crazy! especially for this spec...but for real world use with a mix of tasks, it will not be 17 hours but i did a 9 hour session yesterday, and still had a ton of battery left. the power efficiency is ground breaking. they have added back the magsafe power plug - which is great! and added back an sd card slot and and an hdmi port - which many of us hated the previous macs that deleted these ports. i wish it had at least one usb-a old style port - but it does not. you get three usb-c thunderbolt 4 ports that you can use with adapters if needed. they got rid of the touch screen bar at the top of the keyboard from previous pro macbooks and put back the regular mechanical keys for the controls. apparently they listened to a lot of users who did not really like the touch pad. the shape and style of this laptop is great. some say the edge of the laptop looks ""sharp"" where your wrists rest. that is bs. i have been typing most of the day and i do not feel any issue with the edge of the laptop at all. very comfy for typing. some haters may try to find reasons to bash this new macbook pro, but i am telling you - from any perspective, all brand bias aside - this is an amazing laptop - the best apple has ever made, hands down. and i would say you will not find a better power laptop anywhere. all that said - this is not a gamers machine. apple is not for hard core gamers. i mean you can play games on it that you get from the app store. i am a hard core gamer and a pc geek - i have a powerful windows pc for gaming. and always will. but for everything else. this macbook is king. i use to for music, for photo and video editing, for productivity. i can plut into a giant monitor if i want a bigger screen - it works great on my 34 inch ips panel. so if you are wondering if this macbook 14 inch pro is the real deal or not - i am here to tell you, its the real deal. i finally upgraded from my 2015 macbook pro because this new one hits so many sweet spots - revolutionary power and battery life, excellent ergonomic design, great sound, stunning display - its the whole package. if you are thinking of getting one - you will not be disappointed. one last comment. i am an old timer windows guy, and i know all the counter arguments for the mac. many wills say this is overpriced compared to a windows laptop with similar spec. first, show me an intel based laptop that can match these new m1 pro chips - you cannot. and aside from that, the mac os is secure and stable - rock solid - and is intuitive with amazing features - like the ability to copy and paste text from a photo! whaaat? and the design/ergonomics/quality of these macbooks is unmatched. so, yes you pay more - but you get more. my last macbook pro lasted me almost 7 years and it still works great. if you want this laptop - get it! it rocks.",5/5,you can get the pro max chip and bump up the ram to 64gb if you want - and add tons more storage,0.5,['']

5594,"m1 pro chip is super powerful - photo/video editing, graphic design - this thing just kills it. compared to previous macbook pro, it is a giant leap ahead. these tasks are a main reason to buy the pro version of the macbook. this particularly model is the lower end of the spec you can get for a pro, but it still kicks butt. you can get the pro max chip and bump up the ram to 64gb if you want - and add tons more storage. the 14 inch macbook pro is the perfect size for a balance of portability and power. it can do pretty much everything the 16 inch version does. the display is stunning. just gorgeous. 120hz capability (pro motion) gets rid of blur when scrolling and makes for clearer action when viewing movies. the brightness and black levels on the display are awesome. real hdr viewing - a big difference. you will hear about ""the notch"" at the top of the screen where the camera is. after 10 minutes i do not even notice it. it means nothing for your experience. its just something critics have chosen to harp about. in most apps the notch is no even visible. camera is now a full 1080p and is a big upgrade over previous macbooks. six speaker sound system with new woofers - sounds incredible. music/movies it feels like surround sound. for video conferencing the microphones are studio quality and you can tell - this is great for video conferencing. the keyboard is a dream to type on. very solid like all macbooks, no spongy feel you get with so many other laptops. the apple magic keyboard is the best - as is the track pad. battery life is amazing. i have gone all day on battery without needing to plug in. at best its spec says 17 hours, which is crazy! especially for this spec...but for real world use with a mix of tasks, it will not be 17 hours but i did a 9 hour session yesterday, and still had a ton of battery left. the power efficiency is ground breaking. they have added back the magsafe power plug - which is great! and added back an sd card slot and and an hdmi port - which many of us hated the previous macs that deleted these ports. i wish it had at least one usb-a old style port - but it does not. you get three usb-c thunderbolt 4 ports that you can use with adapters if needed. they got rid of the touch screen bar at the top of the keyboard from previous pro macbooks and put back the regular mechanical keys for the controls. apparently they listened to a lot of users who did not really like the touch pad. the shape and style of this laptop is great. some say the edge of the laptop looks ""sharp"" where your wrists rest. that is bs. i have been typing most of the day and i do not feel any issue with the edge of the laptop at all. very comfy for typing. some haters may try to find reasons to bash this new macbook pro, but i am telling you - from any perspective, all brand bias aside - this is an amazing laptop - the best apple has ever made, hands down. and i would say you will not find a better power laptop anywhere. all that said - this is not a gamers machine. apple is not for hard core gamers. i mean you can play games on it that you get from the app store. i am a hard core gamer and a pc geek - i have a powerful windows pc for gaming. and always will. but for everything else. this macbook is king. i use to for music, for photo and video editing, for productivity. i can plut into a giant monitor if i want a bigger screen - it works great on my 34 inch ips panel. so if you are wondering if this macbook 14 inch pro is the real deal or not - i am here to tell you, its the real deal. i finally upgraded from my 2015 macbook pro because this new one hits so many sweet spots - revolutionary power and battery life, excellent ergonomic design, great sound, stunning display - its the whole package. if you are thinking of getting one - you will not be disappointed. one last comment. i am an old timer windows guy, and i know all the counter arguments for the mac. many wills say this is overpriced compared to a windows laptop with similar spec. first, show me an intel based laptop that can match these new m1 pro chips - you cannot. and aside from that, the mac os is secure and stable - rock solid - and is intuitive with amazing features - like the ability to copy and paste text from a photo! whaaat? and the design/ergonomics/quality of these macbooks is unmatched. so, yes you pay more - but you get more. my last macbook pro lasted me almost 7 years and it still works great. if you want this laptop - get it! it rocks.",5/5,you can get the pro max chip and bump up the ram to 64gb if you want - and add tons more storage,0.5,['']

6583,"i will put this first. i am unsure if the ram or solid state drive is set or if you can upgrade them. i did not try to open or upgrade the item. these are the two things you should research before purchasing this. although with the current specification, i am sure you do not need to do that. this acer laptop overall is an average size laptop and the specification are not bad for what you get. this laptop is relatively thin and not too heavy. it has a decent processor (ryzen 7). the ram is 16 gb which is well beyond the suggested nowadays. it will definitely work for most daily usage as well as design and gaming. that being said, it is not the best in terms of battery life. it really only last about three to four hours at most on a full charge. the fan is a bit loud on heavy usage. it is a standard ac charger which can make it a bit annoying to replace in the future if needed. the power brick is okay but does get hot while charging. you will need it plugged in to really game on this device. upon boot up of the acer laptop, the laptop boots up fairly quick. the setup is pretty straight forward and does not require any driver installation. the bloatware is not too terrible. the laptop also has only a 14 inch screen with the max resolution at 1920 x 1080. the screen has an okay brightness but not the best quality. it still keep the traditional two usb port as well so you do not have to buy an adapter for this laptop while also having the type c (non thunderbolt) port. the laptop can be angled back for better viewing but it cannot be pushed back all the way. the laptop surface where the wrist rest is where i do not like the material. it looks nice with the bright silver but with long term use it will fade over time. the keys are okay, but not the best. i am not a fan of typing on them as it just feels a bit on the cheaper end. the external casing of this surface is very easy to scratch (seems to be an issue with all this material) so i would recommend that you get a laptop case for it. the trackpad runs pretty well, it is sensitive and feels smooth to move across. it also does not look like it will wear down easily which is good. there is a camera that will record at at least 720p. you could put a web cam cover on it. the dual microphone makes for a very clear voice and i have not had any issues with any sound issues. it usually does not pick up too much surrounding noise and focuses more on voice. on laptop, there is a 3.5 port to plug in headphones/microphone. it does have dual band wifi built in and no issues with speed/connection. the laptop itself can last about five to six hours or so on a full charge. depending on how much you have open and how much you utilize the laptop capability, you could actually have less than that. best thing to do is just balance the resource as best you can. the overall charge time depends but it can take up to three to charge the laptop to 100% from what i can tell. it is not too long and the charger does get hot so handle with care. it has a decent boot up being less than fifteen seconds to boot up but the bloatware has to go so i would recommend you uninstall that if possible. the speaker system is pretty loud but they do have a bit of a feedback noise that is a bit annoying but that is okay. the 3060 ti runs great! it is a very powerful card that allows you to game very well on this computer although the screen is only 14 inches. the fan also is a bit loud on high usage (gaming). the processor is an ryzen 7 which is more than enough power for what i need it to do on a daily. in terms of video games, it can play many games at very high quality although you do need to have it plugged in. the processing speed is really fast and it works really well for what i need. there is an hdmi port so you are able to connect this to an external screen. i am unsure if there is a dock that is meant for this laptop. overall this laptop is a a very powerful laptop. you get a smaller screen but the gaming on it is not bad. the acer laptop can run a bit hot and the battery life is not the best. the specification is not bad at 16 gb ram and 512 gb ssd drive. the space is decent for what i need it for but for gaming it will fill up fast. it is good for all around use and can easily be made into a work, gaming, or basic computer with a single monitor connection.",5/5,i am unsure if the ram or solid state drive is set or if you can upgrade them | it has a decent processor (ryzen 7) | the ram is 16 gb which is well beyond the suggested nowadays | the processor is an ryzen 7 which is more than enough power for what i need it to do on a daily | the specification is not bad at 16 gb ram and 512 gb ssd drive,0.17,"['unsure', '', '', '', 'not bad']"

6742,"usually when you get a laptop for this price you expect the laptop to be a little on the slower side especially since most laptops today have 16 gb of memory. this laptop comes with 8 gb of memory soldered in and the laptop will accept another 8 gb of memory which is on order. this is surprisingly fast for only 8 gigs of memory. i had no issues with downloads, apps watching movies or downloading about 250 gb of data from my one drive. the laptop boots up in about 20 seconds. really does not need anything else for my use. might not be enough for gaming but should be kind of decent. my one big complaint about this laptop is the touch panel and keyboard is off center, they did this to put in a number pad which is nice feature. the problem is that on the touch pad while i am trying to click on the item, i keep on right clicking on the item. also, when i put my hands on the keyboard, i sometimes am off by one position and have to reset my hand. i am sure i will overcome the keyboard but the touchpad i am having a hard time with. so, besides the 8gb of memory ordered i ordered a 1 tb ssd drive. i hate one drive i am old schooled i love having items on my computer and being fast. one drive is very clunky but is very usefull for not loosing data when the hard drive goes or for this instance when i got a new computer. it was painless to transfer everything over. for wifi connectivity the router is upstairs and i am in the room directly below and getting speeds of 400 mbps which is really fast. sitting next to the router i have hit average speed of 639 download and peak of just over 700 using speedtest. my macbook is not even doing that. the laptop is really light and feels just a touch flimsy there is almost no flex in the base part and screen does not flex opening and closing. if you grab both ends of the top of the screen you can get it to flex. not a deal breaker at this price point and i really love the laptop. i have had a dell and also an hp laptop at this price point in the past and was alway disappointed and by upgrading was happy. this one many years later which should be costing several hundred dollars more due to inflation but got at the same price as both of them ($500) is quite the bargain. i did not get to test other laptops at this price point but i know this is quite a deal. you will not be disappointed and even though i ordered more memory and a bigger ssd the laptop is pretty good just the way it is. i will upgrade to see if i see any more improvements in speed with the ram. it never hurts to have more. bonus this has windows 11 pro.",5/5,i will upgrade to see if i see any more improvements in speed with the ram,0.5,['']

6948,"i will put this first. i am unsure if the ram or solid state drive is set or if you can upgrade them. i did not try to open or upgrade the item. these are the two things you should research before purchasing this. although with the current specification, i am sure you do not need to do that. this acer laptop overall is an average size laptop and the specification are not bad for what you get. this laptop is relatively thin and not too heavy. it has a decent processor (ryzen 7). the ram is 16 gb which is well beyond the suggested nowadays. it will definitely work for most daily usage as well as design and gaming. that being said, it is not the best in terms of battery life. it really only last about three to four hours at most on a full charge. the fan is a bit loud on heavy usage. it is a standard ac charger which can make it a bit annoying to replace in the future if needed. the power brick is okay but does get hot while charging. you will need it plugged in to really game on this device. upon boot up of the acer laptop, the laptop boots up fairly quick. the setup is pretty straight forward and does not require any driver installation. the bloatware is not too terrible. the laptop also has only a 14 inch screen with the max resolution at 1920 x 1080. the screen has an okay brightness but not the best quality. it still keep the traditional two usb port as well so you do not have to buy an adapter for this laptop while also having the type c (non thunderbolt) port. the laptop can be angled back for better viewing but it cannot be pushed back all the way. the laptop surface where the wrist rest is where i do not like the material. it looks nice with the bright silver but with long term use it will fade over time. the keys are okay, but not the best. i am not a fan of typing on them as it just feels a bit on the cheaper end. the external casing of this surface is very easy to scratch (seems to be an issue with all this material) so i would recommend that you get a laptop case for it. the trackpad runs pretty well, it is sensitive and feels smooth to move across. it also does not look like it will wear down easily which is good. there is a camera that will record at at least 720p. you could put a web cam cover on it. the dual microphone makes for a very clear voice and i have not had any issues with any sound issues. it usually does not pick up too much surrounding noise and focuses more on voice. on laptop, there is a 3.5 port to plug in headphones/microphone. it does have dual band wifi built in and no issues with speed/connection. the laptop itself can last about five to six hours or so on a full charge. depending on how much you have open and how much you utilize the laptop capability, you could actually have less than that. best thing to do is just balance the resource as best you can. the overall charge time depends but it can take up to three to charge the laptop to 100% from what i can tell. it is not too long and the charger does get hot so handle with care. it has a decent boot up being less than fifteen seconds to boot up but the bloatware has to go so i would recommend you uninstall that if possible. the speaker system is pretty loud but they do have a bit of a feedback noise that is a bit annoying but that is okay. the 3060 ti runs great! it is a very powerful card that allows you to game very well on this computer although the screen is only 14 inches. the fan also is a bit loud on high usage (gaming). the processor is an ryzen 7 which is more than enough power for what i need it to do on a daily. in terms of video games, it can play many games at very high quality although you do need to have it plugged in. the processing speed is really fast and it works really well for what i need. there is an hdmi port so you are able to connect this to an external screen. i am unsure if there is a dock that is meant for this laptop. overall this laptop is a a very powerful laptop. you get a smaller screen but the gaming on it is not bad. the acer laptop can run a bit hot and the battery life is not the best. the specification is not bad at 16 gb ram and 512 gb ssd drive. the space is decent for what i need it for but for gaming it will fill up fast. it is good for all around use and can easily be made into a work, gaming, or basic computer with a single monitor connection.",5/5,i am unsure if the ram or solid state drive is set or if you can upgrade them | it has a decent processor (ryzen 7) | the ram is 16 gb which is well beyond the suggested nowadays | the processor is an ryzen 7 which is more than enough power for what i need it to do on a daily | the specification is not bad at 16 gb ram and 512 gb ssd drive,0.17,"['unsure', '', '', '', 'not bad']"
6975,"i have worked with computers for over 40 years, from mainframes to high-end personals, so i know how to make computers work. i ordered this little atrocity so i could spend some time upstairs with my wife, instead of my holing up all the time in the computer cavern in the basement. the little horror arrived about 5 hours ago, and i have spent all that time trying to load word and gmail, and a few others--and that is all. the package of programs that came with it has demanded a new login and password almost with every click. bill gates would be horrified at what his genius has led to. almost every click produces a new pitch for some microsoft product. i wanted to use firefox instead of the microsoft equivalent, and it practically had me read ""war and peace"" before it would let me do it and--i still have not been able to do it. cortana has a soothing voice, but if she were here, i would happily throw her into a tank of live alligators, and chortle all the way up to dinner, where i would eat her liver with a nice chianti. whoever wrote the programs has about a 3rd grade level of english. as an example, one page asks if i give permission to use certain of my data. click no or yes. it then has one box that says ""accept"". well, if i clicked the no box, that means that i do not accept sending them data. no box for ""do not accept."" so how do i say i do not want them to use my data? the little touchscreen is wildly oversensitive, and very hard to use in a practical sense. naturally, there are no written instructions, so you have to make it work before you can discover how to make it work.",1/5,"i have worked with computers for over 40 years, from mainframes to high-end personals, so i know how to make computers work | the package of programs that came with it has demanded a new login and password almost with every click | whoever wrote the programs has about a 3rd grade level of english",0.05,"['', '', '']"
6979,"first one received would not turn on; after a call to tech, a replacement was quickly sent! this is exactly what i was looking for as a travel laptop; small, not much larger than an ipad; w10 os so can load my norton, office 365, zoom, and everything else without hitches. screen quality was great for the size of the unit. small memory, but likely perfect for a road unit and the price. have not got the innovative keypad or touchscreen to work yet (thus no rating), but that is on me and it is not important for the purpose of this unit for me. older processor; wont be mining bitcoin on it, but exactly what i wanted when i purchased. 1 note - it does have an hdmi to connect with a better display. in the photos of the unit at the time when i bought it showed no such connector so i bought a converter...unnecesary as this unit has hdmi, usb 2.0, usb 3.2 and usb 3.2 c.",5/5,"older processor; wont be mining bitcoin on it, but exactly what i wanted when i purchased",0.21,['']
